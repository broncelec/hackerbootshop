{"sku":"800333","brand_name":"Native Eyewear","product_name":"Native Eyewear Vigor Polarized Sunglasses","long_description":"The Native Eyewear Vigor polarized interchangeable sunglasses deliver lightweight comfort, maximum protection and stylish looks. A unique interchangeable lens system lets you switch lenses without having to put your fingers all over them. Asphalt frames include 1 set of polarized brown tinted lenses and 1 set of SportFlex(TM) lenses, for a total of 2 sets of lenses. SportFlex orange-yellow lenses have a blue mirror coating suitable for cloudy or overcast days, and dusk and dawn. Polarized lenses reduce 99% of visible glare from water, snow, sand and pavement for increased visual acuity and decreased eye strain. Polarized Crystal Carbonate(R) (P.C.C.) lenses have the strongest hard coating available to protect against scratching. P.C.C. lenses pass the rigorous ANSI Z80.3 tests for optical clarity and impact resistance and block 100% of harmful UVA and UVB light. Rhyno-Tuff(R) AIR frames endure extreme highs and lows in temperature. Venting system incorporated into the frames enhances airflow and virtually eliminates fog and condensation. Self-adjusting Cushinol(TM) nose pads create a non-slip grip that keeps sunglasses in place, ensuring a soft feel and personalized fit. Mastoid Temple Grip design ensures the temple ends hug behind your ears to securely keep sunglasses in place. Anti-Ocular Intrusion System(R), a 4-point configuration, helps prevent lenses from shooting into your face in the event of high-velocity impact. Cam-action spring hinges quickly lock temples in position. The Native Vigor polarized sunglasses are sized to fit large faces. Optic Gear Kit Includes a semi-hard zip case and a soft protective pouch that doubles as a cleaning cloth.","short_description":"The Native Eyewear Vigor polarized interchangeable sunglasses deliver lightweight comfort, maximum protection and stylish looks.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sunglasses","product_group":"Sport Sunglasses","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s422863.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l422863.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=422863&tt=df","keywords":"Cycling","retail_price":"119.00","sale_price":"119.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=422863\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m422863.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=800333&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8003330019":{"sku":"8003330019","vendor_sku":"139 302 515","upc":"764824007309","color":"ASPHALT/BROWN","retail_price":"119.00","sale_price":"119.00"},"8003330035":{"sku":"8003330035","upc":"048003330037","color":"WOOD/BROWN","retail_price":"119.00","sale_price":"119.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sunglasses","sport-sunglasses"]}
