{"sku":"867876","manufacturer_id":"K-RAVEN GB","brand_name":"Eddyline","product_name":" Eddyline Raven Kayak with Skeg","long_description":"The Eddyline Raven Kayak with Skeg is ready for long tours on the high seas thanks to its high-quality ABS construction and its long, narrow body that carves through waves and swiftly covers distance. Co-extruded ABS laminate creates a hull that offers the looks and performance of a composite kayak with the durability of plastic: exterior is abrasion- and UV-resistant. 2-layer plastic laminate offers incredible stiffness and a hard, glossy appearance that resists abrasion and impact; plus, because it's plastic, it can also be easily repaired. Low-angled, or \"raked,\" bow and stern increase the waterline length when boat is loaded, improving tracking, glide and secondary stability. Hard chines midship provide great tracking while on a wave. Drop-down skeg improves tracking and balance and can be adjusted to correct for crosswinds, currents or wave direction. 10-in. forward hatch and 10-in. rear hatch provide flotation and storage; aft and forward day hatches allow for touring or multiday trips. Perimeter lines, carry handles and deck bungees complete the package so you have everything you need for your trip. The Eddyline Raven Kayak with Skeg weighs 52 lbs.","short_description":"The Eddyline Raven Kayak with Skeg is ready for long tours on the high seas thanks to its high-quality ABS construction and its long, narrow body that carves through waves and swiftly covers distance.","category":"Paddling","subcategory":"Kayaks","product_group":"Touring Kayaks","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s430727.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l430727.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=430727&tt=df","retail_price":"2799.00","sale_price":"2799.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=430727\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m430727.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=867876&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8678760001":{"sku":"8678760001","vendor_sku":"K-RAVEN RED P","upc":"700736516867","size":"16 FT 9 IN","color":"RED PEARL","retail_price":"2799.00","sale_price":"2799.00"},"8678760002":{"sku":"8678760002","vendor_sku":"K-RAVEN GB","upc":"700736516874","size":"16 FT 9 IN","color":"GALAXY BLUE","retail_price":"2799.00","sale_price":"2799.00"}},"categories":["paddling","kayaks","touring-kayaks"]}
