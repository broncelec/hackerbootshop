{"sku":"840704","manufacturer_id":"CG-2.2","brand_name":"Park Tool","product_name":"Park Tool Chain Gang Cleaning Kit","long_description":"The Park Chain Gang cleaning kit is an all-in-one package that contains everything needed to quickly and easily clean your bicycle's chain, cassette cogs and chainrings. Chain Scrubber features an extra-large reservoir holding 2 fl. oz. of solvent that joins with a series of brushes and sponges to clean away grit from your bicycle's chain. Strong magnet at the base of the reservoir draws particles scrubbed from the chain to the bottom, keeping them from being redistributed. Open-cell sponge draws fluid from the chain as it exits the cleaner, helping reduce drips and messes. Also included is the GearClean(R) brush, which, with its curved-teeth end and large synthetic brush end, makes it easy to clean between cogs and chainrings. Rounding out the whole kit is an 8 fl. oz. bottle of Park Citrus ChainBrite solvent, which removes grease and grime buildup without harming alloy, plastic or rubber parts. Park Chain Gang cleaning kit works on all derailleur-equipped bikes and many 3-speed and coaster-brake bikes.","short_description":"The Park Chain Gang cleaning kit is an all-in-one package that contains everything needed to quickly and easily clean your bicycle's chain, cassette cogs and chainrings.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Accessories","product_group":"Bike Tools And Maintenance","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s379467.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l379467.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=379467&tt=df","retail_price":"34.50","sale_price":"34.50","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=379467\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m379467.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=840704&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8407040001":{"sku":"8407040001","vendor_sku":"CG-2.2","upc":"763477001085","retail_price":"34.50","sale_price":"34.50"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-accessories","bike-tools-and-maintenance"]}
