{"sku":"870391","manufacturer_id":"3402-10-00200","brand_name":"New England","product_name":"New England Apex Dry Rope - Special Buy","long_description":"The versatile New England Apex Dry Rope is an exceptional choice whether you're a beginning climber or a seasoned pro and you're climbing at your local sport crag or deep in the mountains. Endura Dry(TM) treatment penetrates to the core and bonds with the rope fiber to retard moisture gain and improve abrasion resistance. Kernmantle construction from U.S.-manufactured, premium materials effectively absorbs falls; friction-reducing finish extends the rope's life. Advanced braiding techniques stabilize the yarns for a consistent feel over the rope's useful life and create superb handling characteristics. Available in 60m or 70m lengths; 70m length allows long leads on today's modern sport routes. Available with a 10.5mm or 11mm diameter; 11mm diameter is heavier than 10.5mm diameter, but stands up to abrasion better and offers more friction for controlled rappelling. The New England Apex Rope meets or exceeds UIAA tests for falls, impact force and elongation.
