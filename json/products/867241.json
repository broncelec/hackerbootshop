{"sku":"867241","manufacturer_id":"06386","brand_name":"Therm-A-Rest","product_name":" Therm-a-Rest Vela Down Blanket","long_description":"On warm-weather camping trips where a tight mummy bag might ruin your sleep, the Therm-a-Rest Vela(TM) Down Blanket offers the freedom to move, flip and adjust your temperature. Durable nylon shell features 650-fill-power down insulation; box-baffle construction keeps down from shifting around, so cold spots are prevented. Down insulation delivers an unsurpassed warmth-to-weight ratio; it's one of the lightest, warmest and most compressible insulations available. Vela Blanket is rated to keep you warm down to about 40degF, making it suitable for warm-weather 3-season outings. Pair the blanket up with a large Therm-a-Rest NeoAir Dream Sleeping Pad (sold separately) for excellent warmth and comfort while car camping. Also works well with most other sleeping pads; choose a lightweight pad for backpacking. Draft tubes and elasticized foot box create a seal around your mattress that keeps drafts at bay. Side snaps and the included Loop Kit allow you to attach the blanket directly to any mattress or another Therm-a-Rest blanket for the ultimate slumber party. Therm-a-Rest Vela Down Blanket includes a stuff sack.","short_description":"On warm-weather camping trips where a tight mummy bag might ruin your sleep, the Therm-a-Rest Vela(TM) Down Blanket offers the freedom to move, flip and adjust your temperature.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags And Accessories","product_group":"Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s421827.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l421827.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=421827&tt=df","keywords":"compact","retail_price":"229.95","sale_price":"229.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=421827\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m421827.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=867241&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8672410001":{"sku":"8672410001","vendor_sku":"06386","upc":"040818063866","size":"LARGE","color":"HARBOR BLUE","retail_price":"229.95","sale_price":"229.95"}}}
