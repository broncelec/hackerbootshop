It's constructed to resist abrasion and maintain great handling throughout years of use. Rope is constructed with UniCore technology, which links the core and sheath in order to limit movement between the 2 parts. UniCore reduces sheath slippage, improves abrasion resistance and allows the rope to stay supple throughout its lifetime. 10.2mm diameter instills confidence while you're climbing, yet because of the UniCore construction, the rope has the handling characteristics of a much smaller rope. The Beal Diablo UniCore 10.2mm x 60m non-dry climbing rope meets UIAA tests for falls, impact force and elongation.","short_description":"Impress your friends with your new Beal Diablo UniCore 10.2mm x 60m non-dry climbing rope.
