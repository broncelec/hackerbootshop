{"sku":"852482","manufacturer_id":"A5UWH4D","brand_name":"The North Face","product_name":"The North Face Isotherm Half-Zip Top - Men's","long_description":"Great protection for cross-country skiing, The North Face Isotherm half-zip men's top regulates your temperature with wind-resistant fabric and a warm merino wool fabric blend. Wind-resistant front is flanked by stretchy, warm wool panels with FlashDry(TM) fibers around the sides, down the back and under the arms for great moisture management. Wind-resistant fabric protects your core and shoulders from the wind and cold without sacrificing breathability and mobility. Blend of merino wool, polyolefin and polyester fabric wicks moisture and dries quickly and offers light insulation in the cold. When your hands need light protection in chilly weather, pull the mitts out from the internal cuffs and over your fingers. The half-zip neck provides extra coverage when fully zipped, or quick ventilation when unzipped. 2-way zip; secure chest pocket; shaped hem; thumbholes; reflective hits. Athlete tested and competition proven, The North Face Isotherm half-zip jacket for men is part of the Flight Series(R) collection.","short_description":"Great protection for cross-country skiing, The North Face Isotherm half-zip men's top regulates your temperature with wind-resistant fabric and a warm merino wool fabric blend.","category":"Cross-Country Skiing","subcategory":"Men's Cross-Country Clothing","product_group":"Men's Cross-Country Ski Tops","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s326959.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l326959.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=326959&tt=df","keywords":"top,shirt,layer,base,baselayer","retail_price":"115.00","sale_price":"79.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=326959\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m326959.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=852482&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8524820001":{"sku":"8524820001","vendor_sku":"A5UWF1A","upc":"766182293974","size":"M","color":"NAUTICAL BLUE/ESTATE BLUE","retail_price":"79.93","sale_price":"79.93"},"8524820002":{"sku":"8524820002","vendor_sku":"A5UWF1A","upc":"766182293967","size":"L","color":"NAUTICAL BLUE/ESTATE BLUE","retail_price":"79.93","sale_price":"79.93"},"8524820004":{"sku":"8524820004","vendor_sku":"A5UWKT0","upc":"766182295619","size":"M","color":"TNF BLACK/ASPHALT GREY","retail_price":"79.93","sale_price":"79.93"},"8524820006":{"sku":"8524820006","vendor_sku":"A5UWKT0","upc":"766182294018","size":"XL","color":"TNF BLACK/ASPHALT GREY","retail_price":"79.93","sale_price":"79.93"}}}
