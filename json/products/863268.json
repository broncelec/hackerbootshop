{"sku":"863268","manufacturer_id":"RHCWF11","brand_name":"Rossignol","product_name":"Rossignol Zymax Skate Skis with NIS Binding Plates","long_description":"The Rossignol Zymax skate skis with NIS binding plates are performance recreational skis made for fitness-oriented skiers and young athletes. Soft-flex tips and tails ensure stable, precise handling. Cobra Racing sidecut widens the skis at the tips for superior stability during the push-off phase and when shifting from one skate to the other. Skis have two base grooves that aid in tracking and add stability during skating for improved directional control. Premium low-density, lightweight wood/air channel core, reinforced with basalt offers resiliency and energy return. Durable Active Cap construction increases torsional stability and offers a supple longitudinal flex. Active Cap also extends the skis' edges creating a wider platform for additional stability and edge control. NIS binding plates are factory bonded to the Rossignol Zymax NIS skate skis: this reduces weight and delivers a precise interface, plus allows easy binding attachment.","short_description":"The Rossignol Zymax skate skis with NIS binding plates are performance recreational skis made for fitness-oriented skiers and young athletes.
