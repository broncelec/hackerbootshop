Ergonomic, hourglass shape is easy to hold and wring dry. Large-capacity sponge with fun, printed Packtowl(TM) covering has enhanced capillary action, absorbing over 15 times its weight in water. The SealLine Deluxe Bailing sponge is resistant to salt water, chemicals, gasoline and oil, yet is gentle enough for use on fiberglass and other delicate marine surfaces. Viscose fabric protects sponge from wear and tear so that when properly cared for, it will stay shipshape for years without losing its absorption power. Hang the SealLine Deluxe Bailing sponge to dry with handy snap-closure hang loop.","short_description":"The SealLine Deluxe Bailing sponge is specially designed for paddlers and features a printed viscose cover for extra absorbency.","category":"Paddling","subcategory":"Paddling Safety Equipment","product_group":"Rescue Accessories","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s431851.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l431851.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=431851&tt=df","retail_price":"14.95","sale_price":"14.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=431851\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m431851.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=813790&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8137900001":{"sku":"8137900001","vendor_sku":"08731","upc":"040818087312","color":"BLUE","retail_price":"14.95","sale_price":"14.95"}},"categories":["paddling","paddling-safety-equipment","rescue-accessories"]}
