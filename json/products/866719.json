{"sku":"866719","manufacturer_id":"0","brand_name":"Hoka One One","product_name":" Hoka One One Stinson Trail-Running Shoes - Women's","long_description":"Built to soar, the women's lightweight Hoka One One Stinson Trail-Running Shoes feature voluminous midsoles to reduce load on your body, and built-in rocker in the forefeet to propel you forward. EVA midsoles feature foam that is 30% softer than traditional running shoe foam, and 2.5 times more voluminous; this extra cushioning dissipates shock from heel striking. Midsoles allow for as much as 20mm of compression in the heel while also creating a stable ride. 6mm heel-to-toe drop positions this shoe as a transition between a barefoot style and a traditional running shoe. Active Foot Frame midsole geometry allows the feet to sink into the shoes as opposed to sitting on top to provide great feedback to the feet while you're running. Wide outsole platforms counterbalance the excess height of the midsole to provide a stable base. Lightweight breathable mesh uppers allow good airflow to keep your feet cool. Polyester linings wick moisture away from feet for extended comfort. Hoka One One Stinson Trail-Running Shoes feature single-pull lacing for easy and quick on/off. High-abrasion rubber and multidirectional traction design provide sure footing on trails.","short_description":"Built to soar, the women's lightweight Hoka One One Stinson Trail-Running Shoes feature voluminous midsoles to reduce load on your body, and built-in rocker in the forefeet to propel you forward.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Women's Footwear","product_group":"Women's Shoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s388091.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l388091.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=388091&tt=df","retail_price":"160.00","sale_price":"160.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=388091\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m388091.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=866719&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8667190001":{"sku":"8667190001","vendor_sku":"0","upc":"887278820352","size":"6","color":"LIGHT BLUE/GREY/GREY","retail_price":"160.00","sale_price":"160.00"},"8667190004":{"sku":"8667190004","vendor_sku":"0","upc":"887278820383","size":"7.5","color":"LIGHT BLUE/GREY/GREY","retail_price":"160.00","sale_price":"160.00"},"8667190005":{"sku":"8667190005","vendor_sku":"0","upc":"887278820390","size":"8","color":"LIGHT BLUE/GREY/GREY","retail_price":"160.00","sale_price":"160.00"},"8667190006":{"sku":"8667190006","vendor_sku":"0","upc":"887278820406","size":"8.5","color":"LIGHT BLUE/GREY/GREY","retail_price":"160.00","sale_price":"160.00"}},"categories":["footwear","womens-footwear","womens-shoes"]}
