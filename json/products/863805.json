{"sku":"863805","manufacturer_id":"ROO-03","brand_name":"Kammok","product_name":" Kammok Roo Hammock","long_description":"The Kammok Roo camping hammock is built for a life of adventure. It will get you off the ground in a hurry, give you a comfortable place to rest and pack up quick when it's time to get on your way. Made of Kammok's proprietary diamond ripstop LunarWave nylon fabric, the Roo is very lightweight, tear resistant and breathable. Roomy enough for two campers, the Roo has a maximum capacity of 500 lbs. Hammock packs into its attached water-resistant compression sack and gets down to the size of an angry blowfish. Comes fully equipped with two hot-forged wiregate Kanga Claw carabiners and two Dyneema Racer Slings for setting up the hammock. Add the Kammok Dragonfly bug net (sold separately) when you're camping in buggy areas to keep mosquitoes away. Check out the Kammok Python straps (sold separately) for the quickest, easiest set up around trees and other fixed objects. For every Roo hammock purchased, Kammok provides life-saving treatments to five children diagnosed with malaria in Africa through a partnership with Malaria No More.","short_description":"The Kammok Roo camping hammock is built for a life of adventure.
