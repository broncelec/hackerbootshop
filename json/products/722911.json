{"sku":"722911","manufacturer_id":"494142","brand_name":"Granite Gear","product_name":" Granite Gear Traditional Canoe Food Pack","long_description":"This deep canoe pack can be loaded up with lots of food, yet it's small enough that it won't become too heavy to carry. Pack refines the age-old portage pack design with an ergonomically cut harness system, sternum strap, arched lid and drawcord overflow. Updated design is now built with Cordura(R) nylon--it's every bit as strong as former material but much lighter. Ballistic nylon bottom offers excellent durability, no matter where you set pack. Padded hipbelt increases stability and comfort.","short_description":"This deep canoe pack can be loaded up with lots of food, yet it's small enough that it won't become too heavy to carry.","category":"Paddling","subcategory":"Canoeing","product_group":"Canoe Accessories","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s430335.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l430335.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=430335&tt=df","retail_price":"136.95","sale_price":"136.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=430335\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m430335.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=722911&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7229110015":{"sku":"7229110015","vendor_sku":"494142","upc":"782922494142","size":"3300 Cu In","color":"IRON","retail_price":"136.95","sale_price":"136.95"}},"categories":["paddling","canoeing","canoe-accessories"]}
