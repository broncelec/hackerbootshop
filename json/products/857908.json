{"sku":"857908","manufacturer_id":"R120301601095","brand_name":"Ride","product_name":"Ride Sage Boa Snowboard Boots - Women's - 2012/2013","long_description":"Step up your game in Ride Sage Boa snowboard boots; they provide high-level, all-mountain performance at a price you'll love. Intuition(TM) liners and Boa(R) lacing deliver an amazing fit. Boa(R) Coiler lacing system, with ankle and cable guides along entire edge of eyestays, distributes closure force evenly for a dialed-in fit that won't loosen up. The Coiler scoops up loose cable when entering as well as exiting the boot; put your foot in, pull back on the tongue, twist the reel a few times and you're off. Intuition(TM) Plush liners with multi-density foam are body-heat activated over several days' use or immediately custom-formable on in-store pipe heaters. Lock Down speed laces tighten liners quickly and easily for a supportive, nonslip fit. Thin, low-profile soles with die-cut EVA midsoles enhance comfort and response; durable rubber Grip outsoles provide dependable traction on snow and ice.","short_description":"Step up your game in Ride Sage Boa snowboard boots; they provide high-level, all-mountain performance at a price you'll love.
