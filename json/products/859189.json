{"sku":"859189","manufacturer_id":"S11213,40","brand_name":"Fischer","product_name":" Fischer RC7 Skate My Style Skate Boots - Women's","long_description":"The stiff Fischer RC 7 Skate My Style skate boots for women are built for entry-level racers and experienced recreational athletes. They offer cuff comfort adjustments and robust torsional support. Canting dials allow you to personalize cuff heights on both the medial and lateral sides of the boots; choose from 3 different height positions for up to 4mm of adjustment. Lightweight hinged stabilizing cuffs provide robust side-to-side support while allowing easy freedom of movement front and back. Easy to adjust rip-and-stick cuff and instep straps allow you to personalize the stiffness and instep hold on the Fischer RC 7 Skate My Style boots. EVA foam cushioning provides warmth and comfort; after several days of skiing, the linings conform to your feet and remain that way to keep you comfortable. Water-resistant lace covers with sealed zippers ensure moisture is kept out. Lightweight NNN soles have a flex and torsional rigidity optimized for advanced skate skiing; a stiff flex and snug fit transfers power directly from your feet to your skates. Easy entry loops and wide openings reduce on-and-off effort needed; slippery fabric inside the heels reduces friction on entry.","short_description":"The stiff Fischer RC 7 Skate My Style skate boots for women are built for entry-level racers and experienced recreational athletes.
