{"sku":"854373","manufacturer_id":"13840","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":"REI Havenpass eVent Jacket - Men's","long_description":"The REI Havenpass jacket with eVent(TM) fabric is perfect for an epic climb to basecamp, alpine touring in a powder-filled bowl or pushing the pace on a snowshoe trek. eVent fabric has a unique membrane structure that allows sweat vapor to easily pass through the fabric; so you can go all out, yet stay drier and enjoy chill-free rest stops. eVent technology works so efficiently, no pit zippers are needed; all seams are sealed for complete waterproof protection; the shell is also windproof to 60+ mph. Embedded Recco(R) reflector enhances radio signals from search-and-rescue Recco detectors for quicker acquisition of position in the event of an avalanche. Helmet-compatible hood is adjustable to provide unhindered peripheral vision; drawcord system also snugs down to fit over your head alone. 2-way front zipper lets you adjust fit and venting; zipper is backed by a stormflap and topped by a chin guard. Adjustable hem drawcord and rip-and-stick cuff tabs let you fine-tune the fit. 2 zippered, mesh-lined front pockets are placed to clear hipbelt; 2 zippered, mesh-lined chest pockets can double as vents; 1 chest pocket has an inner cord port. The REI Havenpass jacket also has 2 inner stretch-mesh pockets that are large enough to comfortably hold climbing skins or other essentials. Note: To keep weight and bulkiness to a minimum, this backcountry jacket does not include a powder skirt. Care instructions: Machine wash warm with detergent (no fabric softener); rinse twice; a warm dryer will rejuvenate the Durable Water Repellent (DWR) finish.","short_description":"The REI Havenpass jacket with eVent(TM) fabric is perfect for an epic climb to basecamp, alpine touring in a powder-filled bowl or pushing the pace on a snowshoe trek.","category":"Men's","subcategory":"Men's Jackets","product_group":"Men's Rain Jackets","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s345679.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l345679.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=345679&tt=df","keywords":"raingear,rain,men's rain jackets,breathable,hardshell","retail_price":"299.00","sale_price":"208.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=345679\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m345679.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=854373&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8543730002":{"sku":"8543730002","vendor_sku":"13840","upc":"485437300020","size":"M","color":"SHALE","retail_price":"208.93","sale_price":"208.93"},"8543730003":{"sku":"8543730003","vendor_sku":"13840","upc":"485437300037","size":"L","color":"SHALE","retail_price":"208.93","sale_price":"208.93"},"8543730004":{"sku":"8543730004","vendor_sku":"13840","upc":"485437300044","size":"XL","color":"SHALE","retail_price":"208.93","sale_price":"208.93"},"8543730007":{"sku":"8543730007","vendor_sku":"13840","upc":"485437300075","size":"M","color":"RAVEN RED","retail_price":"208.93","sale_price":"208.93"},"8543730008":{"sku":"8543730008","vendor_sku":"13840","upc":"485437300082","size":"L","color":"RAVEN RED","retail_price":"208.93","sale_price":"208.93"},"8543730009":{"sku":"8543730009","vendor_sku":"13840","upc":"485437300099","size":"XL","color":"RAVEN RED","retail_price":"208.93","sale_price":"208.93"},"8543730010":{"sku":"8543730010","vendor_sku":"13840","upc":"485437300105","size":"XXL","color":"RAVEN RED","retail_price":"208.93","sale_price":"208.93"}}}
