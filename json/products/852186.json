They shift seamlessly between your ride and your time at school, work or your favorite hangout. Stretch denim fabric provides comfort and mobility as you go through your active day, transitioning easily from bike to business to play with classic denim style. Crotch is reinforced with Schoeller(R) fabric to enhance durability and minimize chafing. 2 front hand pockets, single coin pocket and 2 back drop-in pockets make up the classic 5-pocket style and utility. Rolling up pant cuff exposes reflective tape, which helps boost your visibility to motorists. When you're riding, you can tuck in rear pocket flaps to expose reflective trim, enhancing your visibility to others; pocket flaps can be pulled out to hide reflective trim. U-lock holster is integrated with back waistband to make it easy to carry your lock as you ride. Straight-leg fit with articulated knees enables a comfortable range of motion; high back rise supplies full coverage when you're in a riding position. Please note: indigo dye may transfer to white saddle; it is recommended to wash these with other denim.","short_description":"Our Novara Carrboro Denim bike pants offer casual urban style with excellent on-bike performance.
