Pedal on! Pedal platforms are anatomically contoured and offer a 6deg cant for enhanced joint alignment and knee angle correction, improving leg biomechanics. Large, grippy 3M SafetyWalk(TM) surface areas provide antislip traction and enhance efficiency in power transfer. Raised inner stops subtly correct foot positioning on the pedals. Narrow axles allow the feet to remain closer to the midline, improving both biomechanics and efficiency. Constructed out of lightweight, strong composite material for lasting use; polymer bearings with radial seals require little maintenance. Oversize reflectors are integrated into the pedal bodies for lasting reflectivity.
