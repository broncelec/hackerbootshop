{"sku":"852739","manufacturer_id":"A7KL-JK3","brand_name":"The North Face","product_name":"The North Face Steep Saiku Gloves","long_description":"Don't let cold temps put a damper on the the fun. With GORE-TEX(R) waterproofness and PrimaLoft(R) insulation, The North Face Steep Saiku gloves keep your hands warm on backcountry ski trips. Waterproof, highly breathable GORE-TEX inserts keep your hands dependably dry and comfortable. PrimaLoft(R) One is a patented ultrafine microfiber blend that offers downlike softness, and is incredibly lightweight and water repellent. 100g insulation on the palms and 150g on the backs of the hands keeps your fingers warm when you're skiing down cold, snowy slopes. Palms are lined with polyester with a FlashDry(TM) fabric additive that dramatically improves drying time and breathability without adding weight or bulk or washing out. Removable wrist wraps inside the gloves are designed to hold hand warmer packets (sold separately) to warm blood as it flows to your hands. 5 Dimensional Fit(TM) uses 5 measurements of the hand to construct gloves with an accurate and consistent fit. Radiametric Articulation(TM) improves warmth and blood flow to your fingers by mirroring the natural relaxed curve of the hand. The North Face Steep Saiku gloves have water-resistant cowhide leather exteriors that stand up to regular use and provide great grip.","short_description":"Don't let cold temps put a damper on the the fun.
