{"sku":"862132","manufacturer_id":"CM2052SM01","brand_name":"Cannondale","product_name":"Cannondale F29 Carbon 3 Bike - 2014","long_description":"A very lightweight ride for discerning riders, the Cannondale F29 Carbon 3 hardtail mountain bike combines the fast-rolling performance of 29ers with a carbon frame and a responsive Lefty fork. Lightweight F29 carbon frame features a geometry that's designed to offer race-inspired, nimble handling; 1.5 in. headtube improves strength, stiffness and handling. Rear stays are shaped to help smooth out trail chatter and enhance rolling speed, acceleration and handling. Lefty 29er fork with Push-Button Rebound (PBR) offers 90mm of smooth, responsive travel and precise handling; easy-access lockout and rebound controls are glove-friendly. Large BB30 bottom bracket design increases stiffness for improved power-transfer. SRAM X7 shifters and x9 Type 2 rear derailleur and SRAM X7 front derailleur quickly guide the chain, and your power, through the 20 gears of the 2x10 drivetrain. Magura MT2 hydraulic disc brakes provide great feel and progressive, powerful braking, thanks in part to the pairing of a 180mm rotor up front and a 160mm rotor in the back. Stan's ZTR Rapid rims and fast-rolling, corner-hungry Schwalbe Racing Ralph EVO Perfomance tires are tubeless-ready for an easy upgrade. Specs on the Cannondale F29 Carbon 3 hardtail mountain bike are subject to change; pedals sold separately.","short_description":"A very lightweight ride for discerning riders, the Cannondale F29 Carbon 3 hardtail mountain bike combines the fast-rolling performance of 29ers with a carbon frame and a responsive Lefty fork.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bikes","product_group":"Mountain Bikes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s374855.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l374855.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=374855&tt=df","retail_price":"2899.00","sale_price":"2899.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=374855\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m374855.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=862132&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8621320002":{"sku":"8621320002","vendor_sku":"CM2052MD01","upc":"884603519011","size":"M","color":"CARBON","retail_price":"2899.00","sale_price":"2899.00"},"8621320003":{"sku":"8621320003","vendor_sku":"CM2052LG01","upc":"884603519028","size":"L","color":"CARBON","retail_price":"2899.00","sale_price":"2899.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bikes","mountain-bikes"]}
