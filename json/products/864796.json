{"sku":"864796","manufacturer_id":"13632","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":"REI Quarter Dome T1 Tent - Special Buy","long_description":"The REI Quarter Dome T1 semi-freestanding tent uses lightweight materials and a unique pole design to create a strong, well-ventilated 3-season backpacking tent for all your solo adventures. 1 side-entry door and a large Dry Entry vestibule offer convenient access and ample storage capacity. Semi-freestanding tripod design requires less material to keep overall weight low; staking the tent out maximizes interior space. Aluminum DAC Featherlight NSL hubbed poles are lightweight; setup is quick and easy with pole clips and color coding. Fully adjustable, high-level vents mitigate condensation, drawing cool air under the fly from the lower perimeter and exhausting warm, moist air. Bathtub floor with seam-sealed corners ensures waterproof protection. Windproof, breathable perimeter fabric blocks dust and sand from blowing in under the fly. Silicone-treated, lightweight ripstop nylon fly stays taut in the rain, avoiding moisture-transfer to the tent. The REI Quarter Dome T1 tent offers multiple interior mesh side pockets and hang loops for organization. Tent door stuffs in its own stash pocket for out-of-the-way convenience. Includes tapered, easy-to-stuff compression stuff sack, 5 stakes, 2 guylines and tighteners, pole repair tube, pole and stake bags. Special buy.","short_description":"The REI Quarter Dome T1 semi-freestanding tent uses lightweight materials and a unique pole design to create a strong, well-ventilated 3-season backpacking tent for all your solo adventures.","category":"Camping & Hiking","subcategory":"Tents","product_group":"Backpacking Tents","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s357455.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l357455.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=357455&tt=df","keywords":"tent,summergear,backpacking","retail_price":"219.00","sale_price":"169.73","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=357455\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m357455.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=864796&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8647960001":{"sku":"8647960001","vendor_sku":"13632","upc":"486479600017","color":"LICHEN/PLATINUM","retail_price":"169.73","sale_price":"169.73"}}}
