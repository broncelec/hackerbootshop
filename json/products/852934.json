The SuperMagneto Pro adjusts the amount of resistance to fit your fitness goals, whether you're a seasoned rider or beginner. 4 resistance settings: warm-up with Easy setting, build endurance with Road setting, use Interval setting to increase performance or challenge yourself with Mountain setting. Pedaling your bike on the CycleOps SuperMagneto Pro is quiet and smooth thanks to the magnetic resistance unit. Flywheel offers a smooth, road-like feel at the rear wheel contact point for more realistic training. Mounting your bike to the trainer is simple, thanks to self-centering, one-sided dial adjustment and a quick-lock cam lever that secures your bike with a 90deg handle turn. The wide, stable platform of the frame offers confident use, even during intense training; foldable design of the trainer makes it easy to store. Single-leg leveling adjustment makes it easy to use the trainer on most surfaces, from garage floors to rec rooms. Includes 2 climbing riser blocks to support your front wheel and adjust the angle of your bike to vary the workout. Training mat protects your floor from sweat and bike grime; also helps stabilize the trainer so it will not wander when you're really pedaling fast. Cloth bike thong stretches between your handlebar and seat to catch dripping sweat, keeping if off of your bike below and helping prevent corrosion. CycleOps SuperMagneto Pro Training Kit includes 2 climbing blocks, trainer mat, and bike thong.","short_description":"With easy-to-adjust resistance and a bundle of extras to maximize indoor training, the CycleOps SuperMagneto Pro Training Kit helps you meet training goals during the cold, nasty winter months.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Accessories","product_group":"Bike Trainers","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s379571.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l379571.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=379571&tt=df","retail_price":"520.00","sale_price":"520.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=379571\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m379571.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=852934&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8529340001":{"sku":"8529340001","vendor_sku":"9322","upc":"012527004270","color":"GRAY","retail_price":"520.00","sale_price":"520.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-accessories","bike-trainers"]}
