This lightweight, U.S. Coast Guard-approved PFD provides 29 lbs. of buoyancy; the tug of a cord releases pressurized CO2 gas into the flotation chamber for instant inflation. Compact, adjustable ripstop nylon waist pack stays out of your way for SUP or surfing. Simply rotate the belt until the chamber faces forward, pull the inflation cord and secure the attachment strap over your head. The manual mouth valve backs up the CO2-powered inflator; the bag's clear window lets you check the inflator mechanism for readiness. A zippered pocket on the waist bag holds sunscreen, snacks and other small essentials. Includes 1 CO2 cartridge and a safety whistle. . .","short_description":"Light, easy to wear and instantly inflatable, the NRS Big Kahuna Inflatable PFD offers paddlers over 80 lbs. an alternative to traditional life jackets.","category":"Paddling","subcategory":"Pfds","product_group":"Inflatable Pfds","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s456963.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l456963.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=456963&tt=df","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=456963\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m456963.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=876439&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8764390001":{"sku":"8764390001","vendor_sku":"40026.01.100","upc":"603403185260","size":"UNIVERSAL","color":"BLUE","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"}},"categories":["paddling","pfds","inflatable-pfds"]}
