{"sku":"866808","manufacturer_id":"202900","brand_name":"Thule","product_name":"Thule Chasm Duffel - Large","long_description":"With a whale of a mouth and removable backpack straps, the rugged, weather-resistant Thule Chasm Duffel is your go-to gear hauler for any adventure. Oversize zippered mouth opens from one side like a book, making it easy to access gear in the main compartment. Padded shoulder straps quickly convert the duffel to a backpack; duffel straps snap down cleanly along the side of the duffel so they don't flap around. Exterior compression straps keep gear inside from falling to the lower end when carried in vertical backpack mode. Interior zippered mesh pockets and an exterior zippered pocket organize smaller stuff. Padded bottom cushions your gear; lockable zippers help deter thieves (lock sold separately). Durable, waterproof tarpaulin fabric stands up on its own for easy packing, yet easily folds for storage. The large Thule Chasm Duffel holds 90 liters of gear, enough for an adventure of a week or more.","short_description":"With a whale of a mouth and removable backpack straps, the rugged, weather-resistant Thule Chasm Duffel is your go-to gear hauler for any adventure.","category":"Travel And Luggage","subcategory":"Luggage","product_group":"Travel Duffels","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s463879.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l463879.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=463879&tt=df","retail_price":"144.95","sale_price":"144.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=463879\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m463879.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=866808&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8668080001":{"sku":"8668080001","vendor_sku":"202900","upc":"091021515628","color":"COBALT","retail_price":"144.95","sale_price":"144.95"},"8668080002":{"sku":"8668080002","vendor_sku":"202700","upc":"091021727861","color":"DARK SHADOW","retail_price":"144.95","sale_price":"144.95"},"8668080003":{"sku":"8668080003","vendor_sku":"203100","upc":"091021317246","color":"ZINNIA","retail_price":"144.95","sale_price":"144.95"}},"categories":["travel","luggage","travel-duffels"]}
