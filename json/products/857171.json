{"sku":"857171","manufacturer_id":"1330665","brand_name":"Union","product_name":"Union Force Snowboard Bindings - 2013/2014","long_description":"Dependable and comfortable, Union Force snowboard bindings provide park-to-peak proficiency so you can easily transition from sliding rails to ripping big turns in deep snow. Stage IV bases are made wth high-quality DuPont(TM) Zytel(R) ST nylon; they're strong, supportive and secure, and balance comfort and response. Baseplates are designed to be supremely strong with the smallest footprint possible; this promotes free, even board flex for sweet response, board control and durability. Injected dual-density EVA bushings damp vibrations underfoot, promoting a comfortable ride and smooth, even board flex with no dead spots. Extruded aluminum heel cups undergo an anodizing process that further increases their strength by 30%; they'll maintain their shape no matter how much wear and tear they see. Multizone highbacks offer three different zones of flex for a transitional top-to-bottom flex, with the top third being the softest and the bottom third the stiffest. 3D Direct-Connect ankle straps eliminate elasticity and evenly distribute pressure across feet and ankles for increased comfort and board control. Multi-position toe straps fit a wide range of boots; magnesium buckles are 4 times stronger than aluminum with only half the weight. Union Force bindings are compatible with Burton The Channel M6 snowboards.","short_description":"Dependable and comfortable, Union Force snowboard bindings provide park-to-peak proficiency so you can easily transition from sliding rails to ripping big turns in deep snow.","category":"Snowboarding","subcategory":"Snowboard Bindings","product_group":"Strap Snowboard Bindings","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382979.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382979.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382979&tt=df","retail_price":"199.95","sale_price":"148.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382979\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382979.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=857171&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8571710002":{"sku":"8571710002","vendor_sku":"1330615","upc":"842852135116","size":"L/XL","color":"MATTE BLACK","retail_price":"148.83","sale_price":"148.83"},"8571710004":{"sku":"8571710004","vendor_sku":"1330665","upc":"842852135222","size":"L/XL","color":"MATTE GREEN","retail_price":"148.83","sale_price":"148.83"}},"categories":["snow","snowboard-bindings","strap-snowboard-bindings"]}
