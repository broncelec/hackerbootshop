{"sku":"753408","manufacturer_id":"8004039","brand_name":"Yakima","product_name":" Yakima HullRaiser Kayak Carrier","long_description":"A great alternative to kayak saddles! The J-cradle design of the Yakima HullRaiser mount works with any kayak, supporting it on its side, which is generally stiffer than the bottom. Accommodates most hull shapes; cradles and protects your kayak with soft pads. Because kayak is propped up on its side, it leaves more space on your crossbars for another kayak or other gear. Includes heavy-duty straps with padded buckles for secure transport. Fits round and square bars; fits most factory racks-just add Yakima MightyMounts (sold separately). Includes straps with padded buckles and bow/stern tie-down straps.","short_description":"A great alternative to kayak saddles!
