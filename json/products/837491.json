With sturdy tires, disc brakes and 20 speeds it's a quick, reliable road ride. The Zealo is built to go the distance, whether commuting, doing off-season training or even a bit of light, off-roading on fire roads and gravel paths. Sturdy butted 6061 aluminum frame strikes a balance between resilience and efficiency, offering superb versatility. Shimano Tiagra shifters and derailleurs offer dependable, precise shifts across the 20 gears. FSA Vero compact crankset is paired with a wide-ranging 11-34 cassette to make easy-spinning work of hills, descents and speedy pursuits. Avid BB7 Road mechanical disc brakes deliver consistent, powerful braking no matter the weather-even in rain-so you can confidently stop when you need to. Tough 32h rims are wrapped with 700x28c Schwalbe Marathon tires, which boast puncture protection and a versatile tread; reflective sidewalls enhance your visibility. Frame boasts braze-ons for both fenders and rack for added versatility (fenders and rack sold separately). FSA Wing Compact handlebar offers riders plenty of comfortable hand positions, from the \"wing\" shaped flatter bar tops to the shallower drops.

Specs are subject to change.","short_description":"Take the versatility of a commuter bike and infuse it with the sportiness of a road bike and you get our Novara Zealo.
