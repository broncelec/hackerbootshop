{"sku":"835243","manufacturer_id":"14105","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":"REI Winterflyte Pants - Men's","long_description":"The men's REI Winterflyte pants are designed to move with the body, providing great performance during aerobic winter activities such as cross-country skiing. Double-weave knit polyester/spandex fabric repels wind, resists water and breathes well while providing the comfort of 4-way stretch; blocks wind up to 25 mph. Durable Water Repellent finish causes water to bead up and roll off, fending off light rain showers and snow. The Winterflyte pants dry in under 4 hrs. Highly breathable stretch panels at waist, sides of thighs and across back of knees enhance mobility and venting for comfort while on the go. Ergonomic seam placement, articulated knees and a gusseted crotch deliver a great range of motion and ease of movement. Hand pockets and zip lumbar pocket keep necessities easily accessible and secure. Elastic drawcord waistband provides flexibility and comfort. Zippered cuffs make it easy to get pants on and off over boots or shoes. Active fit offers a contoured cut with strategically placed seams so that the pants move with the body for a full range of motion. Men's REI Winterflyte pants also feature reflective detailing to increase your visibility in low light.","short_description":"The men's REI Winterflyte pants are designed to move with the body, providing great performance during aerobic winter activities such as cross-country skiing.","category":"Cross-Country Skiing","subcategory":"Men's Cross-Country Clothing","product_group":"Men's Cross-Country Ski Pants","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s255499.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l255499.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=255499&tt=df","keywords":"pant,snowpant,pants,bottom","retail_price":"79.50","sale_price":"79.50","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=255499\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m255499.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=835243&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8352430001":{"sku":"8352430001","vendor_sku":"14105","upc":"483524300014","size":"S","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"79.50","sale_price":"79.50"},"8352430002":{"sku":"8352430002","vendor_sku":"14105","upc":"483524300021","size":"M","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"79.50","sale_price":"79.50"},"8352430003":{"sku":"8352430003","vendor_sku":"14105","upc":"483524300038","size":"L","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"79.50","sale_price":"79.50"},"8352430004":{"sku":"8352430004","vendor_sku":"14105","upc":"483524300045","size":"XL","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"79.50","sale_price":"79.50"}}}
