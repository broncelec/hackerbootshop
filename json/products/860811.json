Bi-component shells feature specialized flex zones that complement the natural motions of your feet. Located between the first and second buckles, these zones made of soft plastic boost control, ease turns and enhance balance. Each boot liner features differing materials on the left and right; firm material helps you feel the terrain on the inside of the turn and soft material cushions recovery. The Atomic Hawx 90 ski boots feature mid-wide 100mm footbeds to provide a good mix of comfort and performance. Liners feature cushioning insoles and very warm, soft interiors to enhance comfort. Custom-moldable liners mold forefeet and ankles to increase heel hold. Toe boxes reduce hot spots and increase comfort with 4-way stretch.
