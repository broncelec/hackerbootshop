{"sku":"833113","manufacturer_id":"F7410","brand_name":"Ortlieb","product_name":"Ortlieb Bike-Shopper QL2 Single Pannier","long_description":"The waterproof Ortlieb Bike-Shopper bag mounts to your rear rack as a single pannier, and comes off for your shopping convenience. Large-volume bag goes on and off your rack quickly, freeing you of the need to dangle your grocery bags precariously from your handlebar. Combination adjustable shoulder strap/carry handle is made of sturdy nylon webbing. Pack closes tight and secure with a waterproof locking slider-think of it as an industrial-size and -strength food baggie. Welded seams and coated fabric further ensure your valuables stay dry in rainfall. Zippered interior pocket in the Ortlieb Bike-Shopper single pannier keeps small items handy. Fore and aft reflector patches boost your visibility at dawn and dusk. QL2 system adjusts without tools; rotatable mount allows the bag to be attached on left (standard) or right side. QL2 mounting system is compatible with all standard rear racks with diameters of 8, 10 or 16mm, sold separately. Please note: Ortlieb recommends occasionally applying lubricant to the closure.","short_description":"The waterproof Ortlieb Bike-Shopper bag mounts to your rear rack as a single pannier, and comes off for your shopping convenience.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Accessories","product_group":"Panniers And On-Bike Packs","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s379887.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l379887.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=379887&tt=df","keywords":"bags","retail_price":"100.00","sale_price":"100.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=379887\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m379887.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=833113&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8331130001":{"sku":"8331130001","vendor_sku":"F7407","color":"ICEBLUE/GREY","retail_price":"100.00","sale_price":"100.00"},"8331130002":{"sku":"8331130002","vendor_sku":"F7410","color":"LEATHER BLACK","retail_price":"100.00","sale_price":"100.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-accessories","panniers-and-onbike-packs"]}
