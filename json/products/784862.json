With the polarized protection of the SunCloud Hook sunglasses you're eyes will be able to see past the surface glare and right into the water. Polarized lenses reduce 99% of visible glare from water, snow, sand and pavement for increased visual acuity and decreased eye strain. Polycarbonate lenses are 20 times more impact resistant than glass and a third the weight; they're also acid- and heat-resistant. Grilamid(R) lightweight nylon frames offer a consistent fit and flexibility at any temperature, and they are extremely impact resistant. Hydrophilic Megol(TM) nose pads and temple tips become tackier when wet for reliable grip during exercise and hot weather. Gray-black frames feature polarized gray lenses to eliminate glare and produce the truest transmission of natural colors. Havana frames feature polarized brown lenses to eliminate glare and enhance contrast while maintaining accuracy of color transmissions. Medium fit.","short_description":"Fish had better beware.
