{"sku":"809815","manufacturer_id":"861","brand_name":"La Sportiva","product_name":" La Sportiva TC Pro Rock Shoes","long_description":"Designed for edging and crack climbing, the La Sportiva TC Pro rock shoes get you through sections of smearing on dime edges and jamming your feet in finger cracks. Thin foam padding at the ankles and above the toes helps protect your feet when they're jammed in a crack. Mid-height cuffs cover your ankle bones to guard against scrapes while crack climbing. 4mm Vibram XS Edge(TM) rubber provides excellent grip and holds an edge well on tiny rock features. Ventilated tongues and perforations around the rands promote airflow. Fit is designed such that your toes lay flat so your feet can slip into thin cracks. La Sportiva TC Pro rock shoes were developed in collaboration with professional climber, Tommy Caldwell.","short_description":"Designed for edging and crack climbing, the La Sportiva TC Pro rock shoes get you through sections of smearing on dime edges and jamming your feet in finger cracks.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Shoes","product_group":"Men's Climbing Shoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s407191.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l407191.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=407191&tt=df","retail_price":"180.00","sale_price":"180.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=407191\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m407191.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=809815&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8098150025":{"sku":"8098150025","vendor_sku":"861","upc":"801216097064","size":"38.5","color":"SAGE","retail_price":"180.00","sale_price":"180.00"},"8098150066":{"sku":"8098150066","vendor_sku":"861","upc":"801216097101","size":"40.5","color":"SAGE","retail_price":"180.00","sale_price":"180.00"},"8098150074":{"sku":"8098150074","vendor_sku":"861","upc":"801216097118","size":"41","color":"SAGE","retail_price":"180.00","sale_price":"180.00"},"8098150090":{"sku":"8098150090","vendor_sku":"861","upc":"801216097132","size":"42","color":"SAGE","retail_price":"180.00","sale_price":"180.00"},"8098150108":{"sku":"8098150108","vendor_sku":"861","upc":"801216097149","size":"42.5","color":"SAGE","retail_price":"180.00","sale_price":"180.00"},"8098150116":{"sku":"8098150116","vendor_sku":"861","upc":"801216097156","size":"43","color":"SAGE","retail_price":"180.00","sale_price":"180.00"},"8098150132":{"sku":"8098150132","vendor_sku":"861","upc":"801216097170","size":"44","color":"SAGE","retail_price":"180.00","sale_price":"180.00"},"8098150157":{"sku":"8098150157","vendor_sku":"861","upc":"801216097194","size":"45","color":"SAGE","retail_price":"180.00","sale_price":"180.00"}},"categories":["climbing","climbing-shoes","mens-climbing-shoes"]}
