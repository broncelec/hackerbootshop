{"sku":"862194","manufacturer_id":"CM2076XL01","brand_name":"Cannondale","product_name":" Cannondale Quick CX 1 Bike - 2014","long_description":"On-road speed meets off-road toughness in the Cannondale Quick CX 1 bike, which shifts from urban rides to dirt-road adventures with smooth Shimano components, a shock-absorbent fork and disc brakes. Headshok Fatty DL50 suspension fork supplies 50mm of travel to take the jolts out of a ride; lockout is easy and convenient for when you don't need front suspension. Shimano Deore shifters, Acera and SLX shadow derailleurs guide the chain through 27 smooth-shifting gear combinations to spin easily on terrain you may encounter. Aluminum frame design is mountain-bike inspired and offers an upright riding position that better enables you to scan the road ahead. Frame uses Cannondale Synapse Active Vibration Elimination (S.A.V.E.) technology to damp road vibration for a smooth ride. Magura MT2 hydraulic disc brakes provide all-weather performance with great feel and progressive, powerful braking. Kenda Happy Medium tires have a fast-rolling center with aggressive outside lugs for enhanced traction when cornering. Platform pedals mean no special shoes are equired. Specs on the Cannondale Quick CX 1 bike are subject to change.","short_description":"On-road speed meets off-road toughness in the Cannondale Quick CX 1 bike, which shifts from urban rides to dirt-road adventures with smooth Shimano components, a shock-absorbent fork and disc brakes.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bikes","product_group":"Hybrid Bikes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s378539.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l378539.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=378539&tt=df","retail_price":"1499.00","sale_price":"1499.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=378539\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m378539.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=862194&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8621940001":{"sku":"8621940001","vendor_sku":"CM2076SM01","upc":"884603521908","size":"S","color":"BRUSHED ALUMINUM","retail_price":"1499.00","sale_price":"1499.00"},"8621940002":{"sku":"8621940002","vendor_sku":"CM2076MD01","upc":"884603521915","size":"M","color":"BRUSHED ALUMINUM","retail_price":"1499.00","sale_price":"1499.00"},"8621940003":{"sku":"8621940003","vendor_sku":"CM2076LG01","upc":"884603521922","size":"L","color":"BRUSHED ALUMINUM","retail_price":"1499.00","sale_price":"1499.00"},"8621940004":{"sku":"8621940004","vendor_sku":"CM2076XL01","upc":"884603521939","size":"XL","color":"BRUSHED ALUMINUM","retail_price":"1499.00","sale_price":"1499.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bikes","hybrid-bikes"]}
