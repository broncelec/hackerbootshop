{"sku":"866598","manufacturer_id":"L35923900","brand_name":"Salomon","product_name":"Salomon Synapse Hiking Shoes - Women's","long_description":"Designed for women who take an athletic approach to hiking, the Salomon Synapse Low Hiking Shoes allow natural motion and have been redesigned for better grip and stability. Breathable and abrasion-resistant mesh uppers feature synthetic leather overlays that wrap and secure insteps for a precise fit; toe caps provide protection. Quicklace(TM) lacing system takes just a single pull for an exact fit; lace pocket hides lacing away. Textile linings wick moisture away from your feet to keep them comfortable. Washable OrthoLite(R) EVA foam insoles enhance comfort. Injected EVA midsoles maximize cushioning, comfort and rebound with higher durability than average EVA foam. OS Tendon thermoplastic urethane frames run along the outsoles of the shoes to facilitate better heel-to-toe transitions and push-off efficiency. Nonmarking Contagrip(R) rubber outsoles on the women's Salomon Synapse Low Hiking Shoes deliver traction across mixed terrain and sloppy trail conditions.","short_description":"Designed for women who take an athletic approach to hiking, the Salomon Synapse Low Hiking Shoes allow natural motion and have been redesigned for better grip and stability.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Women's Footwear","product_group":"Women's Shoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s442651.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l442651.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=442651&tt=df","keywords":"trail","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=442651\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m442651.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=866598&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8665980001":{"sku":"8665980001","vendor_sku":"L35923900","upc":"887850080631","size":"6","color":"MIMOSA YELLOW","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8665980002":{"sku":"8665980002","vendor_sku":"L35923900","upc":"887850080648","size":"6.5","color":"MIMOSA YELLOW","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8665980004":{"sku":"8665980004","vendor_sku":"L35923900","upc":"887850080662","size":"7.5","color":"MIMOSA YELLOW","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8665980005":{"sku":"8665980005","vendor_sku":"L35923900","upc":"887850080815","size":"8","color":"MIMOSA YELLOW","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8665980006":{"sku":"8665980006","vendor_sku":"L35923900","upc":"887850080679","size":"8.5","color":"MIMOSA YELLOW","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8665980007":{"sku":"8665980007","vendor_sku":"L35923900","upc":"887850080686","size":"9","color":"MIMOSA YELLOW","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8665980008":{"sku":"8665980008","vendor_sku":"L35923900","upc":"887850080693","size":"9.5","color":"MIMOSA YELLOW","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8665980009":{"sku":"8665980009","vendor_sku":"L35923900","upc":"887850080709","size":"10","color":"MIMOSA YELLOW","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"}},"categories":["footwear","womens-footwear","womens-shoes"]}
