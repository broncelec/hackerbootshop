{"sku":"863076","manufacturer_id":"02750","brand_name":"Msr","product_name":"MSR Hubba Hubba NX Tent","long_description":"At just 3 lbs. 7 oz., the reinvented MSR Hubba Hubba NX tent is an ultralight, ultra-livable three-season shelter for two backpackers. It packs down small thanks to an ultra-compact compression sack. Unique pole configuration maximizes headroom and elbow space throughout the tent. Set up and take down is easy with a unified, color-coded hub-and-pole system. Two large StayDry(TM) doors help ensure water doesn't drip into the tent when doors are opened; two large vestibules store gear. Rainfly vents and venting vestibules help create a dry, comfortable interior. Minimum weight of just 3 lbs. 7 oz. (1.54kg) includes tent, rainfly and poles only. Fast & Light(R) setup option lets you use just the rainfly, poles and footprint (not included) to reduce the weight to 2 lbs. 2 oz. (0.97kg). Canopy is 15-denier nylon micromesh and 20-denier high-tenacity ripstop nylon; floor is 30-denier, high-tenacity ripstop nylon with Durashield(TM) polyurethane coating. Rainfly is 20-denier, high-tenacity ripstop nylon that's Durashield(TM) polyurethane- and silicone-coated. The MSR Hubba Hubba NX tent comes with an ultra-compact compression sack so it fits easily into a backpack.","short_description":"At just 3 lbs. 7 oz., the reinvented MSR Hubba Hubba NX tent is an ultralight, ultra-livable three-season shelter for two backpackers.
