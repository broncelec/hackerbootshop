Dual-zone Boa Coiler lacing system, with ankle and cable guides along entire edge of eyestays, distributes closure force evenly for a dialed-in fit that won't loosen up. The Coiler scoops up loose cable when entering as well as exiting the boot; put your foot in, pull back on the tongue, twist the reel a few times and you're off. High-end synthetic waterproof leather uppers keep feet dry; full-length internal backstays give boots a medium flex for great control in turns. Custom moldable polyethylene and EVA foam liners feature an easy-to-use, secure lace-lock power strap and stretchy neoprene toe boxes for extra comfort. internal heel harnesses lock liners in place for secure heel hold. Warming Blanket Strobel is a heat reflective material in both the shell and the liner that helps retain heat and keep the cold out. ZF1 full-length phylon midsoles/outsoles feature embedded Zoom Air cushioning for superior comfort when on your board and when walking around. Low-profile Air Force 1 shoe-inspired outsoles feature treads that grip the snow and ensure good board feel.","short_description":"Nike Zoom Force 1 Boa women's snowboard boots outfit your feet for conquering the steeps, and feature dual-zone Boa(R) closures so you can get a fast, dialed-in fit for all-day comfort.","category":"Snowboarding","subcategory":"Snowboard Boots","product_group":"Women's Snowboard Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s461647.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l461647.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=461647&tt=df","retail_price":"310.00","sale_price":"216.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=461647\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m461647.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=854910&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8549100001":{"sku":"8549100001","vendor_sku":"586540-646","upc":"884500453364","size":"7","color":"CHERRYWOOD RED/TEAL PINK","retail_price":"216.83","sale_price":"216.83"},"8549100002":{"sku":"8549100002","vendor_sku":"586540-646","upc":"884500453371","size":"7.5","color":"CHERRYWOOD RED/TEAL PINK","retail_price":"216.83","sale_price":"216.83"},"8549100006":{"sku":"8549100006","vendor_sku":"586540-646","upc":"884500453418","size":"9.5","color":"CHERRYWOOD RED/TEAL PINK","retail_price":"216.83","sale_price":"216.83"},"8549100007":{"sku":"8549100007","vendor_sku":"586540-646","upc":"884500453425","size":"10","color":"CHERRYWOOD RED/TEAL PINK","retail_price":"216.83","sale_price":"216.83"}},"categories":["snow","snowboard-boots","womens-snowboard-boots"]}
