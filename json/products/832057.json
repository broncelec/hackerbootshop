{"sku":"832057","manufacturer_id":"WS1101","brand_name":"Bob","product_name":" BOB Sports Utility / Ironman Stroller Weather Shield","long_description":"The BOB Sport Utility / Ironman Stroller weather shield offers protection from inclement weather, helping keep rain and wind at bay. Made of a water- and wind-resistant polyurethane-coated nylon shell with clear water-resistant, thermoplastic urethane window so children can see out and you can see in. Vents are positioned to allow proper airflow while keeping your child dry. Designed specifically for BOB Sport Utility and Ironman single-occupancy strollers, sold separately. Please note: stroller canopy must be in correct position for proper Weather Shield installation; 2011 and newer strollers have rip-and-stick tabs to facilitate this. Older strollers must use retrofit kit to replace the canopy drawcord; kit can be obtained from BOB by contacting their customer service department.","short_description":"The BOB Sport Utility / Ironman Stroller weather shield offers protection from inclement weather, helping keep rain and wind at bay.","category":"Fitness","subcategory":"Running","product_group":"Strollers","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s427463.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l427463.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=427463&tt=df","retail_price":"55.00","sale_price":"55.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=427463\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m427463.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=832057&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8320570001":{"sku":"8320570001","vendor_sku":"WS1101","upc":"692176705454","retail_price":"55.00","sale_price":"55.00"}}}
