{"sku":"860321","manufacturer_id":"113320.184","brand_name":"Volkl","product_name":" Volkl V-Werks Katana Skis - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Using the latest ski tech to significantly reduce weight, Volkl has updated the fully rockered V-Werks Katana skis so they'll blaze through powder atop wide, 112mm waists. Made of lightweight Paulonia wood, the milled-out cores reduce overall weight and make it easy to turn, smear pillows, dump speed or skid past an obstacle in pow. Stiff carbon fiber reinforcement around the core creates a thin profile at the tip and sides that cuts through deep powder snow and enhances maneuverability and response. 112mm waists float easily in the deepest pow, and full rocker increases maneuverability and adds a surflike, floaty feel. The smooth, gradual rocker from tip to tail also creates uninterrupted edge contact on groomed runs, ripping graceful arcs in corduroy on your way back to the base. The full rocker profile is subtle compared to that of other powder-specific Volkl skis, and it enhances maneuverability at high speeds. Low tip smooths out your ride on the groomed runs and resists diving in soft snow. Vertical sidewalls provide excellent grip, stability and sensitivity. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo. Volkl V-Werks Katana skis require bindings with wide brakes.","short_description":"Using the latest ski tech to significantly reduce weight, Volkl has updated the fully rockered V-Werks Katana skis so they'll blaze through powder atop wide, 112mm waists.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382267.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382267.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382267&tt=df","retail_price":"1099.00","sale_price":"1099.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382267\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382267.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=860321&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8603210001":{"sku":"8603210001","vendor_sku":"113320.184","upc":"821264529898","size":"184 CM","retail_price":"1099.00","sale_price":"1099.00"},"8603210002":{"sku":"8603210002","vendor_sku":"113320.191","upc":"821264529904","size":"191 CM","retail_price":"1099.00","sale_price":"1099.00"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
