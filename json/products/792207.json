Urethane frame construction stays flexible, even in extreme cold. XYZ Optics(R) delivers a wide field of downward and side vision, and it enhances clarity at all angles of view. Dual vented lens design, vents below lenses and F-3 antifog treatment work together to fight fogging. Triple-layer polar fleece face foam provides comfort and wicks moisture at skin-contact areas. Wide, adjustable elastic strap gives a comfortable and secure fit, and articulating strap clips evenly distribute pressure on the face whether you're wearing a helmet or not. Polarized VR28 lens tint provides increased contrast and excellent glare reduction; 14% light transmission is best for medium to bright light. Polarized lenses reduce haze and distortion; Oakley uses a patented process to infuse the lens material around the polarized filter and ensure bonding at a molecular level. Lens supplies 100% eye protection against UVA, UVB and UVC light; durable lens material provides impact resistance. Fits small and medium faces, helmet compatible.","short_description":"Get superior clarity and glare reduction with Oakley A-Frame(R) polarized ski goggles.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Goggles","product_group":"Men's Ski Goggles","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s380879.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l380879.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=380879&tt=df","retail_price":"180.00","sale_price":"143.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=380879\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m380879.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=792207&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7922070011":{"sku":"7922070011","vendor_sku":"01-948","upc":"700285260648","color":"JET BLACK/VR28 POLARIZED","retail_price":"143.93","sale_price":"143.93"}},"categories":["snow","ski-goggles","mens-ski-goggles"]}
