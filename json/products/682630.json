{"sku":"682630","manufacturer_id":"OPL5","brand_name":"Omega Pacific","product_name":" Omega Pacific ISO Locking Standard D Carabiner - Anodized","long_description":"This lightweight locking 'biner is constructed using an ISO Cold Forging process for an extraordinary strength-to-weight ratio. Locking mechanism provides security against accidental opening, and locks to the gate, not the frame, to prevent jamming. Classic D shape carriers the loads off-center, toward stronger, non-gated side. Hooded gates offer smooth rope-bearing surfaces. Tapered nose for increased strength and spin rivets for smooth snag-free gate surfaces. Anodized coating won't flake off like paint, helps protect against corrosion and allows you to sort and identify gear easily. CE certified.","short_description":"This lightweight locking 'biner is constructed using an ISO Cold Forging process for an extraordinary strength-to-weight ratio.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Hardware","product_group":"Carabiners","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s440267.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l440267.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=440267&tt=df","retail_price":"13.75","sale_price":"13.75","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=440267\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m440267.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=682630&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"6826300011":{"sku":"6826300011","vendor_sku":"OPL5","upc":"821273404018","color":"BLUE","retail_price":"13.75","sale_price":"13.75"}}}
