Never break your stride! Folding Z-Pole system features 3 sections of light, strong aluminum shafts, an inner Kevlar(R) cord and single push-button release. When you're ready to go, innovative \"speed cones\" help guide each pole section into place, ensuring stability and super-fast deployment. To deploy, simply give a quick pull on the grip and the 3 pole sections snap into place; cinch down the FlickLock Pro clasp on the top pole section to lock in the tension. FlickLock Pro clasp is 20% smaller and 30% easier to open than its predecessor, and offers twice the holding force. Shafts collapse easily to fit into your pack; flexible tube ends protect the inner Kevlar(R) cord when folded. Lightweight EVA foam grips feature breathable, moisture-wicking straps and nonslip foam mini grips that extend down the poles for secure choke-ups. The Black Diamond Ultra Mountain FL trekking poles feature flexible carbide tips and come with trekking baskets and powder baskets.","short_description":"The packable and quick-deploying Black Diamond Ultra Mountain FL Z-Pole trekking poles offer extra stability when backpacking or cruising powder.
