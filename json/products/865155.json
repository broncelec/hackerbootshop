{"sku":"865155","manufacturer_id":"06410","brand_name":"Therm-A-Rest","product_name":"Therm-a-Rest NeoAir Trekker Sleeping Pad","long_description":"The Therm-a-Rest NeoAir(TM) Trekker(TM) Sleeping Pad is now 50% warmer than the previous version, pushing its comfort range well into spring and fall backpacking trips. Reflective layers inside the NeoAir reflect heat back to your body, amplifying warmth without the bulk, weight or durability issues of down and synthetic fills. Patent-pending Triangular Core Matrix construction creates over 100 insulating cells that equalize air distribution for unmatched stability. R-value equals 3.0; most sleeping pads we sell range in R-value from 1.0 (minimally insulated) to 9.5 (well insulated). Rugged, 75-denier polyester bottom and supple, 50-denier top assure maximum versatility with the durability and comfort to handle a wide range of uses. Thermal efficiency without added down or fiber insulation saves weight and allows the Therm-a-Rest NeoAir Trekker Sleeping Pad to pack down small; stuff sack is included.","short_description":"The Therm-a-Rest NeoAir(TM) Trekker(TM) Sleeping Pad is now 50% warmer than the previous version, pushing its comfort range well into spring and fall backpacking trips.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Pads, Cots And Hammocks","product_group":"Sleeping Pads","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s422251.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l422251.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=422251&tt=df","keywords":"mats,mattress","retail_price":"149.95","sale_price":"149.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=422251\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m422251.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=865155&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8651550001":{"sku":"8651550001","vendor_sku":"06409","upc":"040818064092","size":"Regular","color":"PISTACHIO","retail_price":"129.95","sale_price":"129.95"},"8651550002":{"sku":"8651550002","vendor_sku":"06410","upc":"040818064108","size":"L","color":"PISTACHIO","retail_price":"149.95","sale_price":"149.95"},"8651550003":{"sku":"8651550003","vendor_sku":"06408","upc":"040818064085","size":"L TORSO","color":"PISTACHIO","retail_price":"109.95","sale_price":"109.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sleeping-pads-cots-and-hammocks","sleeping-pads"]}
