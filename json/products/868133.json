{"sku":"868133","manufacturer_id":"7020461","brand_name":"Easton","product_name":"Easton EA90 SL Road Wheel - Front","long_description":"With an improved Echo hub for smoothness and durability, the Easton EA90 SL Front Wheel is a sturdy platform for road rides and features tubeless compatability for serious riders. UST tubeless compatibility offers the benefits of tubeless (lighter weight, lower tire pressure and fewer flats), with the option of using a traditional tube/tire setup. Every aspect of the Echo hub is designed to improve bearing life, increase stiffness and cut weight, and the extra width of the hub vastly increases durability. Featuring a 17.5mm internal rim width, the extra-wide alloy rim creates more surface area for traction when leaning into corners. 20 double-butted straight-pull Sapim spokes increase durability. The Easton EA90 SL Front Wheel is completely hand-built; spoke tension is acoustically tuned to provide the best possible ride right out of the box.","short_description":"With an improved Echo hub for smoothness and durability, the Easton EA90 SL Front Wheel is a sturdy platform for road rides and features tubeless compatability for serious riders.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Components","product_group":"Bike Tires, Tubes And Wheels","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s389759.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l389759.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=389759&tt=df","retail_price":"390.00","sale_price":"390.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=389759\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m389759.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=868133&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8681330001":{"sku":"8681330001","vendor_sku":"7020461","upc":"768686935183","size":"700C","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"390.00","sale_price":"390.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-components","bike-tires-tubes-and-wheels"]}
