{"sku":"809263","manufacturer_id":"D14 2B","brand_name":"Petzl","product_name":"Petzl GRIGRI 2 Belay Device","long_description":"Lighter, smaller and more versatile than the original GRIGRI, the Petzl GRIGRI 2 belay device delivers excellent control for top-rope climbing and lead climbing. GRIGRI 2 is 25% smaller and 20% lighter than the original GRIGRI, so it won't slow you down on multipitch climbs when every gram counts; device weighs 185g. Accommodates a wider range of rope sizes than the original GRIGRI; fits single ropes ranging in diameter from 8.9mm - 11mm. Assisted-braking feature is designed to pinch the rope to help the belayer hold falls. New handle design allows a very gradual release of the rope so you can lower a climber with excellent control. Works well for rappelling on single ropes while cleaning or setting a route. Stainless-steel friction plate and cam stand up to regular use. Engraved diagram on side of the Petzl GRIGRI 2 belay device illustrates proper rope setup.","short_description":"Lighter, smaller and more versatile than the original GRIGRI, the Petzl GRIGRI 2 belay device delivers excellent control for top-rope climbing and lead climbing.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Hardware","product_group":"Belay And Rappel Devices","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s380111.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l380111.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=380111&tt=df","keywords":"rappel,belay,ring","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=380111\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m380111.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=809263&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8092630030":{"sku":"8092630030","vendor_sku":"D14 2O","color":"ORANGE","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"}},"categories":["climbing","climbing-hardware","belay-and-rappel-devices"]}
