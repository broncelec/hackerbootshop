Tough enough for most outdoor pursuits, 200-denier Cordura(R) nylon shell is 30% lighter than the MSR Dromedary(TM) hyrdation bag. Plus, boil it or freeze it, the polyurethane, food-grade coating inside handles every use. Versatile three-in-one cap lets you fill, drink and pour with ease. A clever addition for 2006, a new handle around the opening makes filling the bag easier than ever. Largest opening is threaded to fit MSR water filters for no-spill pumping. Grommet on one end allows the bag to be hung.","short_description":"MSR(R) DromLite(TM) 6-liter hydration bag offers the best of two worlds-rugged construction and ultralight convenience!","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Water Bottles And Treatment","product_group":"Water Bottles, Flasks And Jugs","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s425431.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l425431.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=425431&tt=df","keywords":"bladder","retail_price":"32.95","sale_price":"32.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=425431\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m425431.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=733951&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7339510013":{"sku":"7339510013","vendor_sku":"57055","upc":"040818570555","size":"6 L","color":"RED","retail_price":"32.95","sale_price":"32.95"}}}
