{"sku":"854636","manufacturer_id":"31121","brand_name":"Patagonia","product_name":"Patagonia Snowshot Shell Pants - Men's Long","long_description":"The Patagonia Snowshot shell pants deliver confident waterproof protection and season-in, season-out ruggedness with a long inseam for that just-right fit for your longer legs. 2-layer construction boasts a polyester shell with 50% recycled polyester content, backed with a waterproof, breathable laminate to deliver all-weather protection. Durable Water Repellent finish causes water to bead up and roll off, fending off melting snow to help keep you dry. Embedded RECCO(R) reflector enhances radio signals from search-and-rescue RECCO detectors, helping speed up the search for a buried avalanche victim. Loop at rear of waistband lets you securely connect a compatible Patagonia jacket's powder skirt to the Snowshot pants for an integrated riding system (jacket sold separately). Polyester mesh lining helps move sweat away from your body and glides smoothly over base layers; mesh-lined interior thigh vents let you release excess body heat. Brushed lining on waistband wicks sweat and provides against-the-skin comfort; zip-fly, 2-snap closure and adjustable waistband tabs provide a personalized fit. Snow gaiters securely wrap around boots to keep snow from entering pants; scuff guards protect insides of legs and cuffs from abrasion and sharp edges. Zippered handwarmer pockets; zippered thigh cargo pockets. Articulated knees on the Patagonia Snowshot shell pants allow unrestricted movement for deep knee drops and ease when post-holing.","short_description":"The Patagonia Snowshot shell pants deliver confident waterproof protection and season-in, season-out ruggedness with a long inseam for that just-right fit for your longer legs.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Men's Ski Clothing","product_group":"Men's Ski Pants","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s338827.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l338827.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=338827&tt=df","keywords":"pant,snowpant,hardshell pants,pants,snow pants","retail_price":"189.00","sale_price":"189.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=338827\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m338827.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=854636&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8546360001":{"sku":"8546360001","vendor_sku":"31121","upc":"887187254347","size":"S Long","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"189.00","sale_price":"189.00"},"8546360002":{"sku":"8546360002","vendor_sku":"31121","upc":"887187254354","size":"M Long","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"189.00","sale_price":"189.00"}}}
