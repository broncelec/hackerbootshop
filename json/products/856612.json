{"sku":"856612","manufacturer_id":"NCJ2-03-01","brand_name":"Nite Ize","product_name":"Nite Ize CamJam Cord Tightner - 2-Pack with Cord","long_description":"Compact, lightweight and designed for use with narrow cord, the Nite Ize CamJam Cord Tightener cinches, anchors, rigs and secures lighter loads securely, quickly and easily. CamJam threads narrower cord (from 1.8 - 3mm in diameter) for, you guessed it, smaller jobs. With a stainless-steel gated carabiner on 1 end, and a rotating, ridged cam mechanism on the other, the CamJam can be anchored to any hook, D-ring or loop. Feed the cord through the hole and pull it downward through the cam to adjust to the desired tension. Let go, and it locks into place and stays that way until you release it by pulling the cord upward out of the cam, or by rotating the cam open. Easy to adjust, the Nite Ize CamJam Cord Tightener offers 2 versatile systems of use, and can be used and reused hundreds of times. Clipped to rings and hooks, it's excellent for hanging and securing banners, lanterns, tarps and tent guyline. Or, create a loop by clipping it to 1 end of the cord and pulling the other end through; perfect for bundling light gear, extension cords, cut brush, or groceries to a bike. Small size 2-pack includes one 12 ft. section of highly reflective cord. Regular size 2-pack includes two 8 ft. sections of 5/32 in. rope.","short_description":"Compact, lightweight and designed for use with narrow cord, the Nite Ize CamJam Cord Tightener cinches, anchors, rigs and secures lighter loads securely, quickly and easily.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Tents","product_group":"Tent Accessories","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s425083.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l425083.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=425083&tt=df","retail_price":"6.50","sale_price":"6.50","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=425083\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m425083.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=856612&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8566120001":{"sku":"8566120001","vendor_sku":"NCJS-M1-2R3","upc":"094664027046","size":"S","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"5.50","sale_price":"5.50"},"8566120002":{"sku":"8566120002","vendor_sku":"NCJ2-03-01","upc":"094664022584","size":"Regular","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"6.50","sale_price":"6.50"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","tents","tent-accessories"]}
