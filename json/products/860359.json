{"sku":"860359","manufacturer_id":"1140-LR","brand_name":"Voile","product_name":"Voile Splitboard Crampons for Light Rail","long_description":"Increase your traction when touring on your splitboard with the Voile Splitboard Crampons for Light Rail. These crampons work with Voile Light Rail Splitboard Bindings made in 2012/2013 or later. The Voile Light Rail splitboard crampons give you confidence on steep, icy, and exposed ascents or on that frustrating icy skin track. Fixed mode is recommended for high exposure and where security in each step is essential; slot in the back of the crampon fits under the heel pad for the fixed mode. Mobile mode is for moderate ascents and will increase energy efficiency by decreasing drag of the crampon on each step. A rotating puck holds the crampon to the binding when in mobile mode. The crampon is attached to the board half using a longer Slider Pin made specifically for the crampon; this Slider Pin will work for securing your bindings when in ride mode. Includes a nylon storage bag.","short_description":"Increase your traction when touring on your splitboard with the Voile Splitboard Crampons for Light Rail.
