{"sku":"854902","manufacturer_id":"447125-041","brand_name":"Nike","product_name":"Nike Vapen Snowboard Boots - 2013/2014","long_description":"With cushioning underfoot, a soft flex, and liners that conform to your feet thanks to neoprene toes and EVA foam, the Nike Vapen snowboarding boots outfit you for your all-mountain shred sessions. Webbing lace loops on boots let you tighten boots down for a secure fit. High-end synthetic waterproof leather uppers keep feet dry; full-length internal backstays give boots a soft flex for light support and control. Neoprene flex zones at ankles encourage forward flex so you can rip big turns and control your edges. Custom moldable polyethylene and EVA foam liners offer comfort and warmth, and feature internal lacing harnesses to keep your heels locked down; neoprene toes for comfort. Warming Blanket Strobel is a heat reflective material in both the shell and liner that helps retain heat and keep the cold out. Nike Vapen snowboard boots feature ZF1 full-length phylon midsoles/outsoles that are well cushioned for superior comfort when on your board and when walking around. Nike Vapen boots are built on the same lasts (shoe forms) as the revered Nike Kaiju snowboard boots, which are known for their exceptional comfort.","short_description":"With cushioning underfoot, a soft flex, and liners that conform to your feet thanks to neoprene toes and EVA foam, the Nike Vapen snowboarding boots outfit you for your all-mountain shred sessions.","category":"Snowboarding","subcategory":"Snowboard Boots","product_group":"Men's Snowboard Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s461591.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l461591.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=461591&tt=df","retail_price":"220.00","sale_price":"153.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=461591\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m461591.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=854902&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8549020001":{"sku":"8549020001","vendor_sku":"447125-041","upc":"884500433229","size":"8.5","color":"BLACK/VARSITY ROYAL WHITE","retail_price":"153.83","sale_price":"153.83"},"8549020002":{"sku":"8549020002","vendor_sku":"447125-041","upc":"884500433236","size":"9","color":"BLACK/VARSITY ROYAL WHITE","retail_price":"153.83","sale_price":"153.83"},"8549020003":{"sku":"8549020003","vendor_sku":"447125-041","upc":"884500433243","size":"9.5","color":"BLACK/VARSITY ROYAL WHITE","retail_price":"153.83","sale_price":"153.83"}},"categories":["snow","snowboard-boots","mens-snowboard-boots"]}
