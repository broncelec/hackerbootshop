{"sku":"857896","manufacturer_id":"B130300603120","brand_name":"K2","product_name":" K2 Maysis Snowboard Boots - 2013/2014","long_description":"Double Boa(R) closures and Intuition(TM) liners make the K2 Maysis snowboarding boots a strong choice for all-mountain riders. You'll love the fit and feel of these boots. Internal and external Boa lacing systems manage your personalized, secure fit. Maysis boots boast clean, textured aesthetics and shock-absorbing Harshmellow pads to soak up the speed bumps. Intuition(TM) Control-Foam 3D stitched liners feature dual-density Ultralon(R), a flexible thermal-formable EVA foam designed to resist pressure-related pack out. Internal and external J-bars hold heels securely; highly-supportive liner bottoms include molded, dual EVA insoles with Harshmellow pods for extra damping and support. K2 Boa Conda liner lacing system allows on-the-fly control of ankle support and heel hold while the shells are still fully laced by external Boa reels. Smooth-functioning Boa reels anchor shells and liners together for perfect alignment; harness lacing through the floating tongue allows a personalized fit. Microarticulated cuffs and 3D-formed tongues are supportive and durable. Boa(R) Coiler shell lacing, with ankle and cable guides along entire edge of eyestays, distributes closure force evenly for a dialed-in fit that won't loosen up. The Coiler scoops up loose cable when entering as well as exiting the boot; put your foot in, pull back on the tongue, twist the reel a few times and you're off. Low-profile rubber outsoles with lightweight, 3D-molded midsoles offer grip and durability; Harshmellow forefoot and heel inlays provide damping and impact absorption.","short_description":"Double Boa(R) closures and Intuition(TM) liners make the K2 Maysis snowboarding boots a strong choice for all-mountain riders.
