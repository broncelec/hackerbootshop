{"sku":"864872","manufacturer_id":"20227-1","brand_name":"Saucony","product_name":" Saucony Progrid Guide 7 Road-Running Shoes - Men's","long_description":"Light and quick, the Saucony Progrid Guide 7 Road-Running Shoes are designed to follow your feet and provide good stability so you can log lots of miles on training runs and races. A flared forefoot design adds support during toe-off, allowing you to spring forward efficiently and powerfully. 8mm heel-to-toe drop positions this shoe as a transition between a barefoot style and a traditional running shoe. Stable shouldn't mean stiff; the Guide 7 shoes have strategic stability zones that provide support while remaining flexible; flex grooves ensure the shoes move with you. Collars of the shoes are lined with a plush synthetic material that feels great and wicks moisture. Super Rebound Compound impact zone provides durable shock absorption in the heel crash pads to help reduce torque when stepping. PowerGrid composite foam is lightweight and highly responsive to cushion the entire foot; PowerGrid is lighter and more durable than standard EVA foam. Rubber outsoles provide good grip on streets and sidewalks.","short_description":"Light and quick, the Saucony Progrid Guide 7 Road-Running Shoes are designed to follow your feet and provide good stability so you can log lots of miles on training runs and races.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Men's Footwear","product_group":"Men's Shoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s386079.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l386079.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=386079&tt=df","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=386079\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m386079.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=864872&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8648720001":{"sku":"8648720001","vendor_sku":"20227-1","upc":"801100167088","size":"8","color":"SILVER/BLUE/BLACK","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8648720002":{"sku":"8648720002","vendor_sku":"20227-1","upc":"801100167095","size":"8.5","color":"SILVER/BLUE/BLACK","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8648720003":{"sku":"8648720003","vendor_sku":"20227-1","upc":"801100167101","size":"9","color":"SILVER/BLUE/BLACK","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8648720004":{"sku":"8648720004","vendor_sku":"20227-1","upc":"801100167118","size":"9.5","color":"SILVER/BLUE/BLACK","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8648720005":{"sku":"8648720005","vendor_sku":"20227-1","upc":"801100167644","size":"10","color":"SILVER/BLUE/BLACK","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8648720006":{"sku":"8648720006","vendor_sku":"20227-1","upc":"801100167651","size":"10.5","color":"SILVER/BLUE/BLACK","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8648720007":{"sku":"8648720007","vendor_sku":"20227-1","upc":"801100167668","size":"11","color":"SILVER/BLUE/BLACK","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8648720008":{"sku":"8648720008","vendor_sku":"20227-1","upc":"801100167675","size":"11.5","color":"SILVER/BLUE/BLACK","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8648720009":{"sku":"8648720009","vendor_sku":"20227-1","upc":"801100167682","size":"12","color":"SILVER/BLUE/BLACK","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8648720010":{"sku":"8648720010","vendor_sku":"20227-1","upc":"801100167705","size":"13","color":"SILVER/BLUE/BLACK","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8648720011":{"sku":"8648720011","vendor_sku":"20227-1","upc":"801100167712","size":"14","color":"SILVER/BLUE/BLACK","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"}}}
