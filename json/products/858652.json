{"sku":"858652","manufacturer_id":"12009/502","brand_name":"Scarpa","product_name":" Scarpa Freedom Randonee Boots - Women's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Balancing best-in-class features at a great price, the women's Scarpa Freedom randonee boots pair alpine performance with light weight and 27deg of cuff range for excellent tourability. Weighing in at only 3,522g (7 lbs. 12 oz.) per pair for a size mondo 25, the Freedom boots are remarkably light among the freeride boot category. Boots employ a patented Carbon Core Technology, which molds the polyurethane lower boot around a carbon fiber frame to stiffen the boot without adding cumbersome weight. Overlap closure with two upper cuff buckles and two lower cuff buckles, and a low-profile 101mm forefoot last contribute great power transfer. Intuition FR liners put resilient, lightweight and warm foam into a multidensity alpine-style liner that matches the power and tourability of the boot. Forward lean is 14deg, with plus or minus 4deg of adjustability. Vibram(R) injected rubber outsoles provide good grip when you're walking. Included interchangeable DIN soles are compatible with all alpine bindings and randonee bindings except Dynafit-style tech bindings. Optional Vibram Mountain Plus soles (sold separately) make the boots compatible with tech bindings. Scarpa Freedoom randonee boots include adjustable spoilers and oversize power straps.","short_description":"Balancing best-in-class features at a great price, the women's Scarpa Freedom randonee boots pair alpine performance with light weight and 27deg of cuff range for excellent tourability.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Randonee Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382735.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382735.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382735&tt=df","retail_price":"599.00","sale_price":"599.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382735\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382735.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=858652&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8586520001":{"sku":"8586520001","vendor_sku":"12009/502","upc":"666898420094","size":"Mondo 23.5","color":"WHITE/TURQUOISE","retail_price":"599.00","sale_price":"599.00"}},"categories":["snow","ski-boots","randonee-ski-boots"]}
