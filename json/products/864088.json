{"sku":"864088","manufacturer_id":"22410-6355","brand_name":"Marmot","product_name":"Marmot Atom Sleeping Bag","long_description":"The ultralight, down-filled Marmot Atom Sleeping Bag has been used by alpinists as a bivvy bag on extreme climbs, but its comfortable, silky fabric also makes it great for warm-weather backpacking. With a European Norm (EN) lower-limit rating of 43degF, the Atom Sleeping Bag is great for mild-weather ultralight backpacking, typically in summer. Nylon shell is lightweight yet strong; a durable water repellent finish causes moisture to bead up and roll off. Premium-quality 850-fill-power goose down is extremely compressible and offers an exceptional warmth-to-weight ratio. Down is treated to resist moisture to maintain warmth; treated down stays drier 10 times longer, maintains 150% more loft and dries 30% faster than untreated down. Face muff allows hood to be cinched snug without digging into your face. Down-insulated draft tube backs full-length zipper to keep the cold out. Zipper guards prevent zipper snags; locking zippers keep bag from opening if you toss and turn at night. Classic trapezoidal foot box lets your feet move freely and comfortably, and allows goose down to loft fully to keep your toes toasty warm. The Marmot Atom Sleeping Bag comes with a stuff sack and storage sack. European Norm (EN) is an independent third-party temperature rating, allowing accurate comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags.","short_description":"The ultralight, down-filled Marmot Atom Sleeping Bag has been used by alpinists as a bivvy bag on extreme climbs, but its comfortable, silky fabric also makes it great for warm-weather backpacking.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags And Accessories","product_group":"Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s421591.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l421591.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=421591&tt=df","keywords":"compact","retail_price":"309.00","sale_price":"309.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=421591\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m421591.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=864088&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8640880001":{"sku":"8640880001","vendor_sku":"22400-6355","upc":"785562425095","size":"Regular Left","color":"TEAM RED/GLACIER GREY","retail_price":"289.00","sale_price":"289.00"},"8640880002":{"sku":"8640880002","vendor_sku":"22410-6355","upc":"785562500716","size":"Long Left","color":"TEAM RED/GLACIER GREY","retail_price":"309.00","sale_price":"309.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sleeping-bags-and-accessories","sleeping-bags"]}
