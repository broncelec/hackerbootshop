{"sku":"867236","manufacturer_id":"GISU1030","brand_name":"Gibbon","product_name":" Gibbon Surfer Line Slackline Kit - 98 ft. / 30 meters - 2013 Closeout","long_description":"With a long 98 ft. (30 meters) of durable webbing and a heavy-duty ratchet to maximize tension at long distances, the Gibbon Surfer Line slackline kit lets you get into the challenge of longlining. Longlining refers to walking on slacklines that are rigged at distances of around 100 feet or more-longer than a typical 49-ft. slackline distance. Longer lengths of slacklines are more difficult to walk, as the length reduces the amount of tension and therefore stability. The Gibbon Surfer Line slackline comes with a sturdy long-lever ratchet and 8 ft. ratchet band so you can easily adjust the tension to your liking. Dimensions: 30m x 50mm / 98 ft. x 2 in. Closeout.","short_description":"With a long 98 ft.
