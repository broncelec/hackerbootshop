{"sku":"866834","manufacturer_id":"06OZBL01C","brand_name":"Klymit","product_name":"Klymit Inertia O Zone Sleeping Pad","long_description":"Enjoy a restful night after a long day on the trail with the Klymit Inertia O Zone Sleeping Pad. It packs a lot of comfort into a full-length pad that only weighs 12.2 oz. Klymit uses body mapping to support the key areas, such as the head and hips, and removes padding in less critical areas to reduce weight. Cutouts allow a sleeping bag's insulation to remain lofted, which maximizes warmth, rather than becoming compacted between your body and the pad. Pad features a 30-denier ripstop nylon top and a 75-denier polyester bottom for durability. 4-in.-tall pillow supports your head. Rolled up, the Inertia O Zone Sleeping Pad is smaller than a standard 32 fl.oz. water bottle. The Klymit Inertia O Zone Sleeping Pad includes a stuff sack and patch kit.","short_description":"Enjoy a restful night after a long day on the trail with the Klymit Inertia O Zone Sleeping Pad.
