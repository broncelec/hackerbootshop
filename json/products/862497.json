{"sku":"862497","manufacturer_id":"BD120206WHIT230","brand_name":"Black Diamond","product_name":"Black Diamond Shiva Randonee Boots - Women's - 2012 Closeout","long_description":"The women's Black Diamond Shiva randonee boots give you one stiff and powerful pair of boots to do it all on backcountry excursions. Torsionally stiff Triax Performance Pebax(R) frames provide lateral power transfer while balancing weight and performance flex. Pebax plastic maintains a consistent flex in all temperatures so your boots won't feel stiff on a frigid day. Medium-stiff, custom-moldable liners offer a long-lasting, accurate fit and use Black Diamond's proprietary foam to help maintain longevity and warmth. Boa Freeride Series lacing system provides a precise and personalized fit that is simple to adjust with the turn of a dial; Boa holds laces tight and secure. Liners feature articulating zones, insulated bases and a 102mm last width for comfort and performance. Ski/walk switch is hassle free with a simple on/off toggle; ski mode locks you into a forward lean position that can be set at 14deg, 18deg or 22deg. Overlapping cuff design creates a natural progressive flex and ankle articulation to drive and steer skis as well as absorb terrain. Four micro-adjustable buckles and a power strap on each boot close the Black Diamond Shiva randonee boots comfortably and securely around the feet and legs. Black Diamond alpine touring outsole blocks enable compatibility with all randonee bindings, including tech-style bindings such as Dynafit. Addressing the needs of women randonee skiers, the liner, cuff opening, rear spoiler and aggressive stance angle are all specifically designed for the female foot.
