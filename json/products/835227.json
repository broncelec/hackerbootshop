{"sku":"835227","manufacturer_id":"8050407","brand_name":"Whispbar","product_name":" Whispbar Rail Bar - Pair","long_description":"Designed specifically for vehicles with raised factory siderails, this pair of aerodynamic and whisper-quiet Whispbar Rail Bars are a virtually silent roof rack system. Fitting between the factory racks rather than atop them, both Rail bars adjust in length to allow for different widths between fixed factory racks on tapered car roofs. A vehicle-specific Whispbar fitting kit is not required for installation, please visit www.whispbar.com for the most up to date fit information. Whispbar crossbars are designed with an aerofoil shape (think airplane wing) that allows air to pass over with less resistance, reducing drag and increasing fuel efficiency. Aerodynamic bar profile reduces wind noise and drag up to 70% less than other roof racks. Includes bars, integrated towers and mounting hardware. Whispbar accommodates most universal attachments and t-slot attachments for bike, water, snow and cargo accessories. Locks and 2 SKS keys are included. Whispbar Rail Bars have a maximum hauling load of 165.35 lbs./75kg. Bar lengths: S44 = 920mm - 1,020mm/36.2 in. - 40 in.; S45 = 980mm - 1,080mm/38.5 in. - 42.5 in.; S46 = 1,040mm - 1,140mm/41 in. - 45 in. Bar lengths: S53 = 790mm - 850mm/31 in. - 33.5 in.; S54 = 850mm - 910mm/33.5 in. - 36 in.; S55 = 910mm - 970mm/36 in. - 38 in. Please use the Yakima fit guide to select proper Whispbar lengths for your vehicle.","short_description":"Designed specifically for vehicles with raised factory siderails, this pair of aerodynamic and whisper-quiet Whispbar Rail Bars are a virtually silent roof rack system.","category":"Car Racks","subcategory":"Base Roof Racks","product_group":"Car Rack Kits","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s407867.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l407867.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=407867&tt=df","retail_price":"399.00","sale_price":"399.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=407867\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m407867.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=835227&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8352270001":{"sku":"8352270001","vendor_sku":"8050405","upc":"736745504052","size":"S44","retail_price":"399.00","sale_price":"399.00"},"8352270002":{"sku":"8352270002","vendor_sku":"8050407","upc":"736745504076","size":"S45","retail_price":"399.00","sale_price":"399.00"},"8352270003":{"sku":"8352270003","vendor_sku":"8050409","upc":"736745504090","size":"S46","retail_price":"399.00","sale_price":"399.00"},"8352270004":{"sku":"8352270004","vendor_sku":"8050414","upc":"736745504144","size":"S53","retail_price":"399.00","sale_price":"399.00"},"8352270006":{"sku":"8352270006","vendor_sku":"8050416","upc":"736745504168","size":"S55","retail_price":"399.00","sale_price":"399.00"}},"categories":["car-racks","base-roof-racks","car-rack-kits"]}
