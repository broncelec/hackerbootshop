Removable EVA footbeds cushion feet and are perforated in the forefoot area for added ventilation. Lightweight EVA midsoles provide cushioning comfort and shock absorption. Asoflex(R) thermoplastic supports provide torsional stability and control while protecting against impact and bruises on rocks and uneven terrain. Visible Active Heel Support incorporates high- and low-density thermoplastic urethane elements to bring you optimal heel control and shock absorption.
