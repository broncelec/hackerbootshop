Torsion Cap design features a fiberglass wrap that surrounds the entire air-channel wood core, providing a snappy flex that tapers toward the tip and tail. Air-channeled wood core is light, strong and lively. Multigrip bases feature scales of varying depths in the kick zones to give you good grip without the hassle of waxing.
