{"sku":"860815","manufacturer_id":"AE5009760285","brand_name":"Atomic","product_name":" Atomic Waymaker Tour 110 Randonee Boots - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"With lugged soles and hike/ski modes, the lightweight men's Atomic Waymaker Tour 110 W randonee boots also feature powerful carbon reinforcements to help you shred descents in the backcountry. Hike/ski levers release cuffs from lower shells to increase range of motion when hiking; return levers to ski position to lock down cuffs during the descent. Cuffs allow 35deg of forward and back motion for excellent comfort when you're skinning and hiking; boots lock into a 15deg forward lean angle in ski position. Carbon- and pebax-reinforced areas of the cuff and shell offer direct power transmission and excellent responsiveness while maintaining sensitivity on the front of boot. Single-component shell moves as a single piece to maximize power transfer and ensure high performance, and pliable plastic flex zones adapt instantly to the shape of foot. Located between the first buckle and the toe, flexible shell zones made of soft plastic improve balance, circulation, warmth and sensitivity. Intuition liners can be custom molded to your feet for an accurate fit that holds your heels and ankles in place when you're skiing. Lugged soles provide good traction when you're hiking on trails and scrambling on rock; soles are compatible with all randonee bindings, including Dynafit-style tech bindings. Soles can we switched out for DIN alpine soles (sold separately) for compatibility with all alpine bindings. Stiff flex index of 110 offers the responsiveness preferred by advanced skiers. The Atomic Waymaker Tour 110 ski boots for men feature 101mm footbeds to provide a comfortable fit.","short_description":"With lugged soles and hike/ski modes, the lightweight men's Atomic Waymaker Tour 110 W randonee boots also feature powerful carbon reinforcements to help you shred descents in the backcountry.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Randonee Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382747.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382747.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382747&tt=df","retail_price":"699.00","sale_price":"559.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382747\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382747.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=860815&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8608150002":{"sku":"8608150002","vendor_sku":"AE5009760275","upc":"887445009160","size":"Mondo 27.5","color":"ORANGE","retail_price":"559.93","sale_price":"559.93"}}}
