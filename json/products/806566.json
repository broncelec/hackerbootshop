{"sku":"806566","manufacturer_id":"7424M1.MA","brand_name":"Marker","product_name":" Marker Squire 110 Alpine Ski Bindings","long_description":"Offering a highly stable platform, the Marker Squire B110 alpine ski bindings bring lightweight versatility to freeriders. Cross-axis toe spring and compact mounting pattern create a short binding that enables fluid spins and twists. Triple Pivot Compact toe absorbs high levels of energy to prevent prerelease. Hollow Linkage heel saves weight and increases stiffness by using a hollow, aluminum axle. Excellent boot-to-binding contact optimizes power transmission to the ski; toe height is adjustable. Stainless-steel antifriction device allows essential lateral boot movement despite the condition of dirty or worn soles or negative sliding friction. 110mm brake fits most all-mountain wide skis and some powder skis; brake is designed to offer extra clearance when skiing backward. Mounting configuration requires a 76mm minimum ski width. Marker Squire B110 is built to accommodate skiers ranging from 65 to 240 lbs.","short_description":"Offering a highly stable platform, the Marker Squire B110 alpine ski bindings bring lightweight versatility to freeriders.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Bindings","product_group":"Downhill Ski Bindings","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s451467.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l451467.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=451467&tt=df","retail_price":"190.00","sale_price":"149.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=451467\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m451467.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=806566&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8065660014":{"sku":"8065660014","vendor_sku":"7424M1.MA","upc":"883295003532","size":"DIN 3 - DIN 11","color":"WHITE/BLACK","retail_price":"149.93","sale_price":"149.93"}}}
