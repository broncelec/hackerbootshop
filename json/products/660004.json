Strike a match and you're instantly cooking with 10,000 BTU's of heat. No more pumping or priming, collapsible stove screws onto Snow Peak or MSR isobutane cartridges or Primus butane/propane canisters. Performs well in cold temperatures and can be reduced to a true simmer for actual cooking, not just boiling water for freeze-dried foods. Fold-out wires provide support for most sizes of cooking pots; stable stove base allows cooking on varied surfaces. Snow Peak GigaPower stove comes in a plastic box for easy packing; size specifications are based on storage box. Weight includes stove, not the canister.","short_description":"The tiny, featherweight Snow Peak GigaPower stove is barely noticeable in your pack.
