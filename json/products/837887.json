In-mold technology bonds the helmet's tough outer microshell to the internal expanded polystyrene (EPS) liner, creating a light, cool and strong helmet. 12 vents move cool, fresh air through the helmet while radiating heat and stale air out. Fine-tune the airflow using 2 low-profile Thermostat(TM) control buttons located on the outside of the helmet; buttons open and close vents. Vent placed over the center vent of goggles reduces internal fogging and maintains an integrated fit. Very lightweight fit system adjusts tightness with an easy-to-use racheting dial; you can also adjust the fore-aft tilt of the helmet using 1 hand. Minimalist goggle-keeper cord doubles as a handy attachment system for your pack; delploy cord from inside of helmet and clip to pack using the built-in carabiner. Giro Montane Snow Helmet accommodates TuneUps audio systems, sold separately. This snow helmet complies with ASTM F 2040 and/or CE EN 1077 alpine ski and snowboard helmet safety standards.","short_description":"Very lightweight and perfect for hiking for your turns in the sidecountry, the Giro Montane(TM) Snow Helmet offers cooling airflow, solid styling and a great fit.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Helmets","product_group":"Men's Ski Helmets","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s461315.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l461315.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=461315&tt=df","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"90.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=461315\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m461315.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=837887&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8378870001":{"sku":"8378870001","vendor_sku":"2033758","upc":"768686849442","size":"S","color":"MATTE BLACK","retail_price":"90.93","sale_price":"90.93"}},"categories":["snow","ski-helmets","mens-ski-helmets"]}
