Not only do they have a refined look, fit and feel, they're stronger than ever. With 4 sides to choose from, pedal entry is easy and reliable; you'll click-in quicker than on any other pedal. Slim stack height provides excellent ground clearance; unique design and few moving parts allow reliable entry even when gunked up with mud. New spindle is manufactured to pass European standards of quality and safety; you never need to worry about breaking the spindle. New spring design alleviates wing rattle, spring migration and breakage from fatigue. Aesthetic design features an aluminum CNC'd body with steel investment cast wings. Candy 3 pedals feature smooth-operating needle bearings. Watertight and airtight internal parts promote long life and require little maintenance. Pedals should only be used with the Crank Brothers cleats (included) which will fit almost any SPD-compatible shoe.","short_description":"Crank Brothers Candy 3 Pedals are redesigned for 2011.
