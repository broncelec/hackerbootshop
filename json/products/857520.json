{"sku":"857520","manufacturer_id":"84540","brand_name":"Patagonia","product_name":"Patagonia Troposphere Jacket - Men's","long_description":"The Patagonia Troposphere is a 2.5-layer waterproof, breathable jacket made with a generous dose of stretch for full mobility while skiing or alpine climbing in cold, wet weather. Springtime in the alpine means tough approaches, sunny south-facing rock and icy shaded corners; the ultimate all-arounder's season-and the Troposphere keeps pace. 2.5-layer H2No(R) Performance Standard shell fabric is waterproof, windproof and breathable, and because there is no inside lining it is lightweight and highly compressible. Excellent stretch enables gymnastic movement. Helmet-compatible, 2-way-adjustable hood ensures solid protection and all-direction visibility. Trim, minimal stormflap protects the center-front zip. Coated, watertight pit zips provide venting. Soft, self-fabric rip-and-stick cuff closures and dual-adjust drawcord hem seals in warmth. Napoleon-style chest pockets with pressed pleats provide generous and convenient storage; handwarmer pockets are above the harness line for easy access. Patagonia Troposphere jacket is constructed with a regular fit.","short_description":"The Patagonia Troposphere is a 2.5-layer waterproof, breathable jacket made with a generous dose of stretch for full mobility while skiing or alpine climbing in cold, wet weather.","category":"Men's","subcategory":"Men's Jackets","product_group":"Men's Rain Jackets","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s301267.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l301267.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=301267&tt=df","keywords":"raingear,windproof,breathable,waterproof,protection","retail_price":"299.00","sale_price":"148.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=301267\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m301267.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=857520&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8575200001":{"sku":"8575200001","vendor_sku":"84540","upc":"885657521647","size":"XS","color":"CILANTRO","retail_price":"148.83","sale_price":"148.83"}}}
