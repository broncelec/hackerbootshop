{"sku":"737380","manufacturer_id":"SR110WZ046E","brand_name":"Pmi","product_name":" PMI E-Z Bend Sport Static Rope - 11mm x 46m","long_description":"This low-stretch PMI static rope with knot-friendly EZ-Bend sheath braiding is a favorite of cavers and search-and-rescue teams. Durable EZ-Bend(TM) nylon sheath offers greater flexibility than most static ropes, making it easier to knot and untie. Kernmantle design matches a static nylon core (kern) with an abrasion-resistant braided nylon sheath (mantle) for durability. Kernmantle construction gives it greater flexibility than most static ropes, with low static elongation. Especially useful in applications where dynamic \"bounce\" is unwanted: jumaring, rappelling and hauling. Sold in a 46m (~150ft.) length; diameter is 11mm (~7/16in.).","short_description":"This low-stretch PMI static rope with knot-friendly EZ-Bend sheath braiding is a favorite of cavers and search-and-rescue teams.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Ropes","product_group":"Static And Rescue Ropes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s383831.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l383831.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=383831&tt=df","keywords":"rappel","retail_price":"129.00","sale_price":"129.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=383831\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m383831.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=737380&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7373800015":{"sku":"7373800015","vendor_sku":"SR110WZ046E","upc":"767719013355","size":"11 Mm X 150 Ft","color":"WHITE/BLACK&RED","retail_price":"129.00","sale_price":"129.00"}}}
