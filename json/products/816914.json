{"sku":"816914","manufacturer_id":"96744140","brand_name":"Mad River","product_name":" Mad River Journey 156 Canoe","long_description":"The Mad River Journey 156 canoe offers stability, versatility and high durability. It's perfect for your favorite summertime flatwater. Similar in construction to Royalex(R) hull, triple-layer polyethylene construction offers high flotation, excellent durability and low maintenance. Advanced molding techniques put more material in the high impact areas and less in the low impact areas, resulting in a light and stiff hull. Symmetrical, shallow-arch hull offers excellent tracking on flatwater and high stability. High-volume hull with gently rockered ends provides excellent tracking. The Mad River Journey 156 canoe features webbed seats and sculpted portage yoke. Vinyl gunwale offer excellent durability; molded carry handles at bow and stern decks aid in transport.","short_description":"The Mad River Journey 156 canoe offers stability, versatility and high durability.
