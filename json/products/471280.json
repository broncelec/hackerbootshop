{"sku":"471280","manufacturer_id":"D09","brand_name":"Petzl","product_name":"Petzl Stop Descender","long_description":"Originally designed for caving, the Stop Descender is a device that stops or considerably slows descent when the handle is released. Locking mechanism can be disabled with a carabiner when a hand is needed to negotiate a drop. Handle is squeezed to descend normally, controlling speed with the other hand; slack rope can easily be taken up. All control surfaces are stainless steel. Works best with clean, flexible rope, stiff rope may result in greatly impaired or reduced friction and the stop feature may be inoperative.","short_description":"Originally designed for caving, the Stop Descender is a device that stops or considerably slows descent when the handle is released.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Hardware","product_group":"Ascenders And Descenders","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s380079.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l380079.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=380079&tt=df","keywords":"belay,rappel","retail_price":"140.00","sale_price":"140.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=380079\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m380079.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=471280&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"4712800012":{"sku":"4712800012","vendor_sku":"D09","retail_price":"140.00","sale_price":"140.00"}},"categories":["climbing","climbing-hardware","ascenders-and-descenders"]}
