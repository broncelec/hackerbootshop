{"sku":"858670","manufacturer_id":"304441","brand_name":"Dalbello","product_name":" Dalbello Boss Ski Boots - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Backside kickers and laps in the terrain park are all in a day's work for the Dalbello Boss ski boots. They feature an intermediate-level freeride flex and built-in shock absorbers. Shock-absorbent cuff inserts make big-air landings a little easier on the shins, and shock-absorbent heel inserts make them a bit easier on your feet as well. Dalbello Boss boots feature a 3-piece shell design that ensures a precise foothold and a smooth, progressive flex as you bend your knees into the turn. Separate cuff, shell and tongue sections are joined together to create a smooth forward flex with rigid lateral support. Comfy liners feature medium-density foam around the rear feet and tongues and stretchy toe boxes. Liners are engineered to fit correctly right out of the box, but they can be custom formed as well, a procedure best performed in an REI specialty ski shop. Medium flex index of 100 - 110 provides the responsive power transfer suited to progressing intermediate skiers. Vary flex by adjusting the tension of top buckle and power strap. Cable instep buckle on each boot minimizes foot sliding, heel lift and shell distortion while flexing.","short_description":"Backside kickers and laps in the terrain park are all in a day's work for the Dalbello Boss ski boots.
