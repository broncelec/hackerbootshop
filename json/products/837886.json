{"sku":"837886","manufacturer_id":"2033718","brand_name":"Giro","product_name":"Giro Seam Snow Helmet - Men's","long_description":"As you explore untouched powder glades and steep backside terrain, the Giro Seam(TM) snow helmet is ready to keep you comfortable, warm and protected. In-mold technology fuses the helmet's tough outer shell to the internal expanded polystyrene (EPS) liner, creating a light, cool and strong 1-piece helmet. 12 vents move cool, fresh air through the helmet while radiating heat and stale air out. Fine-tune the airflow using 2 low-profile Thermostat(TM) control buttons located on the outside of the helmet; buttons open and close vents. Vent placed over the center vent of goggles reduces internal fogging and maintains an integrated fit. Fit system features outrigger arms and an adjustment dial to fine-tune the fit; dial is easily operated, even with gloves on. Flexible pad at the base of the fit system conforms to head shape for a plush, personalized fit. Internal height adjustment compensates for different head shapes and goggles sizes and reduces nose pinching and gap between helmet and goggles. X-Static(R) antimicrobial padding helps control odors. Giro Seam snow helmet accommodates TuneUps audio systems, sold separately. This snow helmet complies with ASTM F 2040 and/or CE EN 1077 alpine ski and snowboard helmet safety standards.","short_description":"As you explore untouched powder glades and steep backside terrain, the Giro Seam(TM) snow helmet is ready to keep you comfortable, warm and protected.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Helmets","product_group":"Men's Ski Helmets","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s461311.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l461311.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=461311&tt=df","retail_price":"160.00","sale_price":"111.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=461311\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m461311.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=837886&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8378860005":{"sku":"8378860005","vendor_sku":"2033716","upc":"768686849022","size":"S","color":"MATTE WHITE","retail_price":"111.93","sale_price":"111.93"},"8378860006":{"sku":"8378860006","vendor_sku":"2033717","upc":"768686849039","size":"M","color":"MATTE WHITE","retail_price":"111.93","sale_price":"111.93"},"8378860007":{"sku":"8378860007","vendor_sku":"2033718","upc":"768686849046","size":"L","color":"MATTE WHITE","retail_price":"111.93","sale_price":"111.93"}},"categories":["snow","ski-helmets","mens-ski-helmets"]}
