V-shaped aluminum frame supports the load and helps transfer weight to the hipbelt. Hydration-compatible design features a reservoir sleeve with hanging tabs and a sip-tube exit port for on-the-go hydration (reservoir not included). 2 lid pockets (1 internal, 1 external), hipbelt pocket, front storage compartment and side stretch pockets let you organize your headlamp, batteries and water bottles.
