Full-length, closed-cell polyethylene foam provides cushioning; 3/4-length polypropylene heel caps stabilize feet. Narrow and moderately deep heel pockets, slightly raised heel profile and strategically placed forefoot padding add comfort and support. Topsheets feature low-friction nylon covers to help reduce friction and hot spots; topsheets are also treated with AgION(TM) to help control odor. Wide forefoot shape supplies an improved fit and underfoot coverage within today's road cycling shoes and inline or ice skates. Venting holes are designed to line up with perforated outsoles to enhance air circulation and moisture management. Superfeet recommends these insoles to be used with footwear with elevated heels, such as road cycling shoes, track spikes, hockey or figure skates or western boots. Ideal for feet with low to medium arches.","short_description":"Superfeet Yellow premium insoles supply extra stability and support for use in performance shoes with elevated heels, such as road cycling shoes.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Footwear Accessories","product_group":"Insoles","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s376651.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l376651.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=376651&tt=df","keywords":"shoe inserts","retail_price":"39.95","sale_price":"39.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=376651\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m376651.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=813594&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8135940001":{"sku":"8135940001","vendor_sku":"44004","upc":"086301440042","size":"B (4.5-6)","retail_price":"39.95","sale_price":"39.95"},"8135940002":{"sku":"8135940002","vendor_sku":"44006","upc":"086301440066","size":"C (5.5-7)","retail_price":"39.95","sale_price":"39.95"}}}
