{"sku":"824134","manufacturer_id":"6120M1.WS","brand_name":"Marker","product_name":"Marker M4.5 EPS Junior Downhill Ski Bindings - Kids'","long_description":"Designed for the smallest champions on the hill, the Marker M4.5 EPS Junior downhill ski bindings feature a low release setting to accommodate a child's small size and weight. Bindings feature the same safety and performance features found in Marker's adult bindings. Edge Pressure System equalizes the force between the heel and toe piece, directing it over the edge of the ski for smooth-carving turns. Upward release mechanism in toe reduces stress on knees, which is especially important in reducing injury during backward, twisting falls. Gliding antifriction device under the ball of the foot allows boot position to adjust to changing forces, for safety and performance. The Marker M4.5 EPS Junior downhill ski bindings feature a brake width of 74mm.","short_description":"Designed for the smallest champions on the hill, the Marker M4.5 EPS Junior downhill ski bindings feature a low release setting to accommodate a child's small size and weight.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Bindings","product_group":"Downhill Ski Bindings","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s381527.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l381527.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=381527&tt=df","retail_price":"90.00","sale_price":"90.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=381527\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m381527.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=824134&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8241340001":{"sku":"8241340001","vendor_sku":"6120M1.WS","upc":"883295100750","color":"WHITE/BLACK","retail_price":"90.00","sale_price":"90.00"}},"categories":["snow","ski-bindings","downhill-ski-bindings"]}
