{"sku":"761132","manufacturer_id":"BD1021790000ALL","brand_name":"Black Diamond","product_name":" Black Diamond Transfer 7 Snow Shovel","long_description":"Providing maximum snow-moving power and rapid deployment, the Black Diamond Transfer 7 shovel has a large-volume blade and sturdy shaft. Unique patent-pending trapezoidal bent shaft offers maximum extension through a two-piece design that enhances both reach and strength. Shaft deploys quickly via a quick squeeze of spring pins; shaft shape prevents rotation, so the spring pins engage every time. Ergonomic T-grip handle feels like a D-grip but packs small and is glove- and mitten-friendly. Large anodized 6000-series aluminum blade is smooth and flat, carving quickly through snow during recovery; cuts clean during pit analysis. Pointed blade enables effective chopping, and flat sides smooth pit walls; anchor holes through blade accommodate use as a dead man anchor.","short_description":"Providing maximum snow-moving power and rapid deployment, the Black Diamond Transfer 7 shovel has a large-volume blade and sturdy shaft.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Mountaineering Gear","product_group":"Avalanche Safety Gear","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s407319.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l407319.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=407319&tt=df","retail_price":"54.95","sale_price":"45.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=407319\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m407319.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=761132&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7611320016":{"sku":"7611320016","vendor_sku":"BD1021790000ALL","upc":"793661087120","color":"SILVER","retail_price":"45.93","sale_price":"45.93"}}}
