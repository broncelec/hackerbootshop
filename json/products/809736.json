{"sku":"809736","manufacturer_id":"381062","brand_name":"Black Diamond","product_name":" Black Diamond HotWire Quickdraw Set","long_description":"The lightweight Black Diamond HotWire(R) quickdraw set lets you climb, clip and clean with ease. Straight-gate Nitron 'biner on top and a hot-forged HotWire(R) 'biner on bottom are linked by a 14mm Dynex dogbone runner, creating a strong and light quickdraw. Hot-forged HotWire 'biner is 20% lighter than previous versions, yet maintains the same easy-to-use size of the original HotWire. Nose angle on the HotWire has been opened slightly to improve the ease of clipping. Hot-forged Nitron 'biner features an ergonomic, hot-forged gate for easy clipping; keylock gate won't snag on protection, slings or bolt hangers. Rubber Straitjacket(TM) insert in runner loop keeps the bottom carabiner in proper orientation for easier and more efficient clipping. The Black Diamond HotWire Quickdraw set is available in a 12cm length.","short_description":"The lightweight Black Diamond HotWire(R) quickdraw set lets you climb, clip and clean with ease.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Hardware","product_group":"Quickdraws","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s380195.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l380195.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=380195&tt=df","retail_price":"17.95","sale_price":"17.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=380195\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m380195.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=809736&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8097360013":{"sku":"8097360013","vendor_sku":"381062","upc":"793661138471","size":"12 Cm","color":"ORANGE","retail_price":"17.95","sale_price":"17.95"}},"categories":["climbing","climbing-hardware","quickdraws"]}
