{"sku":"856441","manufacturer_id":"2038425","brand_name":"Blackburn","product_name":"Blackburn Sideroller Side Entry Water Bottle Cage","long_description":"The Blackburn Sideroller side entry water bottle cage uses a clever rotating chassis that lets you orient the cage opening to optimize bottle access on smaller or full-suspension bikes. Rotating cage of the Sideroller can be moved so that bottles can be removed outward 90deg to the left, right, or any angle between. Because the cage can be oriented so that bottles come out from either side, the cage works great for both lefties and righties. Made from tough alloy and polycarbonate for lasting use.","short_description":"The Blackburn Sideroller side entry water bottle cage uses a clever rotating chassis that lets you orient the cage opening to optimize bottle access on smaller or full-suspension bikes.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Accessories","product_group":"Water Bottles And Cages","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s375127.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l375127.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=375127&tt=df","keywords":"holder","retail_price":"15.00","sale_price":"15.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=375127\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m375127.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=856441&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8564410001":{"sku":"8564410001","vendor_sku":"2038425","upc":"768686888595","retail_price":"15.00","sale_price":"15.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-accessories","water-bottles-and-cages"]}
