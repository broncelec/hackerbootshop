{"sku":"839001","manufacturer_id":"MTN-28","brand_name":"Kahtoola","product_name":"Kahtoola MTN 28 Step-In Snowshoes","long_description":"The clever Kahtoola MTN 28 step-in snowshoes offer adaptable performance for changing conditions, letting you switch from crampon-only to full snowshoe capability with step-in ease. Modular design lets you detach the forefoot crampons from the snowshoes while they're still attached to your boots for biting traction when flotation isn't needed. Alternatively, it's just as easy to reconnect the forefoot crampons to the snowshoe decks with step-in ease and convenience. Bindings feature easy WingSpan(TM) width adjustment to optimize fit and comfort for your boot type and size; choose between narrow, regular and wide width settings. Aluminum frames are shaped to balance efficiency and flotation; coated nylon decking is tough and lightweight. Kahtoola MTN 28 step-in snowshoes have crampons that are made of sturdy, corrosion-resistant stainless steel to ensure lasting, aggressive traction.","short_description":"The clever Kahtoola MTN 28 step-in snowshoes offer adaptable performance for changing conditions, letting you switch from crampon-only to full snowshoe capability with step-in ease.","category":"Snowshoeing","subcategory":"Snowshoes","product_group":"Men's Snowshoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s432111.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l432111.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=432111&tt=df","retail_price":"289.00","sale_price":"201.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=432111\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m432111.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=839001&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8390010001":{"sku":"8390010001","vendor_sku":"MTN-28","upc":"855333000261","color":"RED","retail_price":"201.93","sale_price":"201.93"}},"categories":["snow","snowshoes","mens-snowshoes"]}
