With fly-first (DryPitch(TM)) pitching you can set the tent up in the rain and stay dry. DryPitch lets you set up the fly first and then set the canopy up beneath it and out of the rain; you stay dry, your gear stays dry and your tent's canopy stays dry. Footprint and gear loft are included. 2 side doors ensure easy access; 2 large vestibules shelter and stow gear outside the tent. Mesh canopy provides ventilation; polyester panels around the lower tent offer privacy during lounging or when changing clothes. Dual zipper sliders allow easy door operation and ventilation options. Reflective guyout loops, starter point and zipper pulls provide easy setup and good visibility at night. DAC Pressfit(R) poles feature a securely fixed, pressed-in ferrule, ensuring the poles will remain strong and reliable, even with heavy usage. Taped, full-coverage polyester rainfly maintains a taut pitch even when wet; durable nylon taffeta floor uses polyurethane coating for waterproofness. Guaranteed watertight construction with fully taped fly, taped perimeter seams, welded corners and welded guy clip anchors. Mesh storage pockets and included gear loft help keep small essentials at hand. Fly, footprint and poles pitch without canopy to create a lightweight shelter.
