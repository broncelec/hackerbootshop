Shockcorded fiberglass poles are 1 size larger than normal for added strength and sturdiness. Polyester taffeta body and rainfly are lightweight yet long-lasting. Walls have been left uncoated so the tent can breathe under the urethane-coated fly, which helps reduce condensation. Center fly pole creates an awning over each door; full-coverage rainfly ensures excellent rain protection. Factory-sealed seams on the floor and rainfly increase water repellency. 2 doors allow convenient entry and exit, eliminating the need to crawl over others to get in and out. Second door also aids cross ventilation in hot, muggy weather. Mesh storage pockets and gear loft keep small items organized. The ALPS Mountaineering Meramac 2 Tent comes with stakes and guylines.
