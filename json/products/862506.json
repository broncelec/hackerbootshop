{"sku":"862506","manufacturer_id":"10215","brand_name":"Vapur","product_name":" Vapur Eclipse Water Bottle - 32 fl. oz.","long_description":"With low-key colors and a soft matte finish, tough Vapur Eclipse 32 fl. oz. water bottle is less flashy than the Vapur Element bottle, but it's just as tough, light and compact for backpacking use. Weighing only 1.4 oz., the Eclipse 32 fl. oz. bottle is about 1/4 the weight of a 32 fl. oz. hard-plastic water bottle. Patented flexible design is lighter and easier to hold than a rigid plastic bottle, and it folds flat when empty to fit compactly in your backpack. Durable three-ply construction allows the bottle to be folded and frozen without damaging it. Polyethylene/nylon construction with antimicrobial lining won't impart tastes or odors on your water. Water-tight cap has a flip-top opening for easy sipping; unscrew the cap from the bottle when you need to refill. Comes with a plastic accessory carabiner so you can clip the bottle to a backpack strap. Vapur Eclipse 32 fl. oz. water bottle is 100% BPA free; dishwasher safe.","short_description":"With low-key colors and a soft matte finish, tough Vapur Eclipse 32 fl. oz. water bottle is less flashy than the Vapur Element bottle, but it's just as tough, light and compact for backpacking use.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Water Bottles And Treatment","product_group":"Water Bottles, Flasks And Jugs","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s425975.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l425975.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=425975&tt=df","retail_price":"13.95","sale_price":"13.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=425975\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m425975.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=862506&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8625060002":{"sku":"8625060002","vendor_sku":"10213","upc":"819792010032","color":"OLIVE","retail_price":"13.95","sale_price":"13.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","water-bottles-and-treatment","water-bottles-flasks-and-jugs"]}
