Huge mattress offers maximum space and comfort; the XXL version is more than half as wide as a queen-size bed. 4 in. of warm, compliant foam offers comfort no matter where you camp. R-value equals an off-the-charts 11.4; most sleeping pads we sell range in R-value from 1.0 (minimally insulated) to 9.5 (well insulated). Fabric shell provides next-to-skin softness while the rugged bottom resists punctures wherever you camp. The Therm-a-Rest MondoKing Sleeping Pad compresses to a surprisingly reasonable travel size; stuff sack included.","short_description":"For comfort and support on a massive scale, the Therm-a-Rest MondoKing(TM) Sleeping Pad offers a full 4 in. of ultra-responsive, body-contouring foam in a huge pad that's perfect for car camping.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Pads, Cots And Hammocks","product_group":"Sleeping Pads","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s422263.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l422263.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=422263&tt=df","keywords":"mats,mattress","retail_price":"189.95","sale_price":"189.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=422263\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m422263.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=865209&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8652090001":{"sku":"8652090001","vendor_sku":"06969","upc":"040818069691","size":"L","color":"NAUTICAL BLUE","retail_price":"159.95","sale_price":"159.95"},"8652090002":{"sku":"8652090002","vendor_sku":"06970","upc":"040818069707","size":"XXL","color":"NAUTICAL BLUE","retail_price":"189.95","sale_price":"189.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sleeping-pads-cots-and-hammocks","sleeping-pads"]}
