{"sku":"837908","manufacturer_id":"2033787","brand_name":"Giro","product_name":"Giro Nine.10 Snow Helmet - Men's","long_description":"Featuring an excellent fit and tough protection, the Giro Nine.10(TM) snow helmet delivers warmth, comfort and style on the mountain. Lightweight design with progressive lines and wide-angle cut provides great peripheral vision and a gapless fit with your goggles. In-mold technology fuses the helmet's tough outer shell to the internal expanded polystyrene (EPS) liner, creating a light, cool and strong 1-piece helmet. 14 vents move cool, fresh air through the helmet while radiating heat and stale air out. Take control of your warmth level with the included vent shield. Fit system features outrigger arms and an adjustment dial to fine-tune the fit; dial is easily operated, even with gloves on. Flexible pad at the base of the fit system conforms to head shape for a plush, personalized fit. Internal height adjustment compensates for different head shapes and goggles sizes and reduces nose pinching and gap between helmet and goggles. Security loop and deep Goggle Notch(TM) keep goggles attached to your helmet in the event of a major digger. Compatible with TuneUps audio systems, sold separately. Giro Nine.10 snow helmet complies with ASTM F 2040 and/or CE EN 1077 alpine ski and snowboard helmet safety standards; for additional information please see REI expert advice.","short_description":"Featuring an excellent fit and tough protection, the Giro Nine.10(TM) snow helmet delivers warmth, comfort and style on the mountain.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Helmets","product_group":"Men's Ski Helmets","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s461319.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l461319.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=461319&tt=df","retail_price":"100.00","sale_price":"69.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=461319\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m461319.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=837908&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8379080005":{"sku":"8379080005","vendor_sku":"2033786","upc":"768686849725","size":"S","color":"TITANIUM","retail_price":"69.93","sale_price":"69.93"},"8379080006":{"sku":"8379080006","vendor_sku":"2033787","upc":"768686849732","size":"M","color":"TITANIUM","retail_price":"69.93","sale_price":"69.93"}},"categories":["snow","ski-helmets","mens-ski-helmets"]}
