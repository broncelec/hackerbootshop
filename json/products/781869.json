{"sku":"781869","manufacturer_id":"KL 2 C21 240","brand_name":"Werner","product_name":"Werner Kalliste Paddle - Carbon","long_description":"Kalliste from Werner provides low-angle paddlers with premium materials and an exceptionally light and buoyant stroke. Extremely lightweight carbon fiber shaft offers a bit of flex to increase paddling comfort. Adjustable Ferrule System allows elegant adjustment of feathering angle from 0deg - 60deg right or left in 15deg increments. Improved ferrule design incorporates internal printing of offset degrees and a low-profile button release that makes paddle feel like 1 piece. Carbon fiber/foam core blades create a unique profile that enters and exits the water quietly while adding buoyancy for a light stroke. Blade design with ribless back allows for a smoother sculling stroke; asymmetrical dihedral shape delivers a flutter-free stroke and reduces fatigue. Midsize blades are designed with power and bracing in mind yet are surprisingly easy to pull through the water. Remarkably light swing weight reduces overall fatigue on long paddling excursions. Drip rings help keep hands and lap dry. 2-piece design breaks down quickly and eases transport and storage.","short_description":"Kalliste from Werner provides low-angle paddlers with premium materials and an exceptionally light and buoyant stroke.","category":"Paddling","subcategory":"Paddles","product_group":"Kayak Paddles","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s430991.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l430991.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=430991&tt=df","retail_price":"400.00","sale_price":"400.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=430991\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m430991.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=781869&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7818690021":{"sku":"7818690021","vendor_sku":"KL 2 C21 230","upc":"478186900214","size":"230 Cm","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"400.00","sale_price":"400.00"},"7818690039":{"sku":"7818690039","vendor_sku":"KL 2 C21 240","upc":"840463104903","size":"240 Cm","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"400.00","sale_price":"400.00"}},"categories":["paddling","paddles","kayak-paddles"]}
