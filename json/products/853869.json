Made from waterproof, breathable fabric and fully seam sealed, the poncho keeps out all but the heaviest rain. Snaps at hem create sleeve openings in poncho; 4-way stretch frees up your arm movements. Adjustable 3-panel hood cinches for excellent coverage. Integrated belt cinches waist; front open pockets keep your hands warm when you're off the bike. Center-front half-zipper lets you vent and slip the poncho on and off easily; stormflap protects the zipper, which is not waterproof.
