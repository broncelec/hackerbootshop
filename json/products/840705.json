{"sku":"840705","manufacturer_id":"CM-5.2","brand_name":"Park Tool","product_name":"Park Cyclone Chain Scrubber","long_description":"The Park Cyclone chain scrubber helps make cleaning your bike's chain a simpler, cleaner process. An extra-large reservoir holds 2 fl. oz. of solvent while a series of brushes and sponges work to clean away grit from your bike chain. A strong magnet at the base of the reservoir draws particles scrubbed from the chain to the bottom, keeping them from being redistributed. Open-cell sponge draws fluid from the chain as it exits the cleaner, helping reduce drips and messes. Updated design features strong clips and an ergonomically shaped handle. The Park Cyclone chain scrubber works with all multi-speed bikes and some single-speed models.","short_description":"The Park Cyclone chain scrubber helps make cleaning your bike's chain a simpler, cleaner process.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Accessories","product_group":"Bike Tools And Maintenance","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s379471.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l379471.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=379471&tt=df","retail_price":"26.00","sale_price":"26.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=379471\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m379471.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=840705&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8407050001":{"sku":"8407050001","vendor_sku":"CM-5.2","upc":"763477001931","retail_price":"26.00","sale_price":"26.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-accessories","bike-tools-and-maintenance"]}
