{"sku":"850520","manufacturer_id":"FB13KF1332","brand_name":"Folbot","product_name":" Folbot Kiawah 133 Folding Kayak","long_description":"Destined for placid scenery and great memories, the Folbot Kiawah 133 folding kayak is designed for quick assembly and lazy afternoons on the water. Maybe you can't store a hard-shell at home, or maybe you want the best paddling experience possible on an upcoming destination trip; either way, you'll want a Folbot. It sets up in about 20 min., and folds up into a pack that you can store in your car's trunk or your gear closet. Thanks to a clever tensioning device in the rear of the kayak, you can first assemble the frame and then insert it into the skin, streamlining the set-up process. The Kiawah 133 is the smaller cousin of the Cooper, suited to paddlers weighing 130 - 180 lbs. Perfect for day trips, the stable hull tracks well and cuts through flatwater and gentle currents with ease. Used by roofers, the military and whitewater-raft makers, a synthetic rubber material called Elvaloy is tough like a rhino's hide and protects the hull of the Kiawah. Urethane-coated polyester protects the decks; all outer materials on the Kiawah resist UV light and are designed to take a beating without puncturing. Frame of the Kiawah is just as sturdy as its skin, with stainless-steel keel brackets (say that 3 times fast), aircraft-grade tubing and anodized aluminum cross pieces. Inflatable chambers called sponsons run the full length of the boat to increase tension and lock frame pieces into place; sponsons also flare out the hull to enhance stability. Seat and footpegs adjust to create a comfortable position in the cockpit. Easy-to-open zippers with high-strength zipper heads offer access to interior of kayak; rip-and-stick stormflaps and water-resistant closures keep things sealed up tight. Solid aluminum strip protects the bow and stern keels. What's included? Your kayak will come inside its backpack with skin, frame, 2 foot braces, 2 air sponsons, 2 safety bladders, and inflatable seat.","short_description":"Destined for placid scenery and great memories, the Folbot Kiawah 133 folding kayak is designed for quick assembly and lazy afternoons on the water.","category":"Paddling","subcategory":"Kayaks","product_group":"Folding Kayaks","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s430523.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l430523.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=430523&tt=df","retail_price":"1525.00","sale_price":"1525.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=430523\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m430523.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=850520&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8505200001":{"sku":"8505200001","vendor_sku":"FB13KF1332","upc":"610373015596","color":"RED/GRAY","retail_price":"1525.00","sale_price":"1525.00"}}}
