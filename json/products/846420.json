{"sku":"846420","manufacturer_id":"033728-657-1-S/","brand_name":"Osprey","product_name":" Osprey Kestrel 28 Pack","long_description":"The Osprey Kestrel 28 pack sports a fast and light design with lightweight materials and all the features you need for done-in-a-day climbing, cragging and other outdoor adventures. Mesh-covered, die-cut EVA hipbelt saves weight and enhances breathability. Pack fits a wide variety of backs thanks to rip-and-stick, torso-length adjustability: just rip it, adjust it and stick it. Back panel features ridge-molded foam with channels covered in mesh to allow airflow. HDPE framesheet provides flexible and light structural support. Trekking pole attachment lets you stow and remove poles (not included) while wearing pack. Poles tuck away between your arm and pack; adjustable shockcord on left-hand shoulder strap and a side loop hold poles in tightly. Front and side stretch-woven pockets are ideal for stashing a jacket and other often-used gear. Hipbelt features 2 zippered pockets for stashing a digital camera and snacks. Hydration-compatible design features reservoir sleeve and drink tube exit port for on-the-go hydration (reservoir sold separately). 2 ice axe loops with bungee tool tie-offs let you lash extra gear outside. Side compression straps let you cinch down loads for jostle-free carrying. The Osprey Kestrel 28 pack features an integrated raincover that pulls out in a flash to protect contents from unexpected rain.","short_description":"The Osprey Kestrel 28 pack sports a fast and light design with lightweight materials and all the features you need for done-in-a-day climbing, cragging and other outdoor adventures.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Backpacks","product_group":"Day Packs","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s411139.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l411139.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=411139&tt=df","retail_price":"139.95","sale_price":"139.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=411139\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m411139.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=846420&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8464200001":{"sku":"8464200001","vendor_sku":"033728-657-1-S/","upc":"877257011680","size":"S/M","color":"TARN BLUE","retail_price":"139.95","sale_price":"139.95"},"8464200002":{"sku":"8464200002","vendor_sku":"033728-657-2-M/","upc":"877257011697","size":"M/L","color":"TARN BLUE","retail_price":"139.95","sale_price":"139.95"},"8464200003":{"sku":"8464200003","vendor_sku":"033728-771-1-S/","upc":"877257011703","size":"S/M","color":"CONIFER GREEN","retail_price":"139.95","sale_price":"139.95"},"8464200004":{"sku":"8464200004","vendor_sku":"033728-771-2-M/","upc":"877257011710","size":"M/L","color":"CONIFER GREEN","retail_price":"139.95","sale_price":"139.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","backpacks","day-packs"]}
