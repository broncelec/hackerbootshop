{"sku":"831135","manufacturer_id":"MTI-807C-0GA34","brand_name":"Mti","product_name":"MTI Moxie PFD - Women's","long_description":"The Moxie PFD by MTI includes women-specific padding and a mesh back that's designed to clear high seat backs in kayaks and canoes. Memory foam pads inside front of the vest personalize fit and add support. By filling the space under the bust, the memory foam evens out the contact between the body and the jacket, resulting in a remarkable difference in fit. 400-denier nylon and 300-denier polyester shell offers durable good looks season after season. Open sides add ventilation and free arm movement. Shoulder adjustments are covered to add protection and provide a smooth, finished look to the vest. 2 large zippered pockets stash on-the-water essentials and include a tethered safety whistle. Reflective tape accents on front, back and shoulders of the MTI Moxie PFD enhance visibility in low light.","short_description":"The Moxie PFD by MTI includes women-specific padding and a mesh back that's designed to clear high seat backs in kayaks and canoes.","category":"Paddling","subcategory":"Pfds","product_group":"Women's Pfds","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s432003.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l432003.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=432003&tt=df","retail_price":"85.00","sale_price":"85.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=432003\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m432003.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=831135&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8311350004":{"sku":"8311350004","vendor_sku":"MTI-807C-0GA34","upc":"762894031897","size":"S/M","color":"TURQUOISE/ALUMINUM","retail_price":"85.00","sale_price":"85.00"},"8311350005":{"sku":"8311350005","vendor_sku":"MTI-807C-0GA56","upc":"762894031903","size":"L/XL","color":"TURQUOISE/ALUMINUM","retail_price":"85.00","sale_price":"85.00"}},"categories":["paddling","pfds","womens-pfds"]}
