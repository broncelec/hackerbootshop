{"sku":"858417","manufacturer_id":"BD102181000ALL1","brand_name":"Black Diamond","product_name":"Black Diamond Transfer 3 Snow Shovel","long_description":"Built with aerospace aluminum for a lightweight, ultra-strong design, the Black Diamond Transfer 3 shovel helps you throw as much snow as possible from the smallest footprint of space. The durable, high-volume blade and extendable shaft provide the snow-moving performance you need in any backcountry situation. Shaft deploys quickly via a quick squeeze of spring pins; shaft shape prevents rotation for positive engagement of spring pins every time. Ergonomic T-grip handle feels like a D-grip but packs small and is glove- and mitten-friendly. Sturdy anodized 6000-series aluminum blade has a smooth and flat shape that carves quickly through snow during recovery and cuts clean during pit analysis. Pointed blade enables more effective chopping and flat sides help in smoothing pit walls; anchor holes through blade allow use as a dead man anchor. Black Diamond Transfer 3 shovel weighs 650g (1 lb. 7 oz.).","short_description":"Built with aerospace aluminum for a lightweight, ultra-strong design, the Black Diamond Transfer 3 shovel helps you throw as much snow as possible from the smallest footprint of space.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Mountaineering Gear","product_group":"Avalanche Safety Gear","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s407399.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l407399.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=407399&tt=df","retail_price":"49.95","sale_price":"41.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=407399\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m407399.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=858417&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8584170001":{"sku":"8584170001","vendor_sku":"BD102181000ALL1","upc":"793661199335","color":"BLUEBIRD","retail_price":"41.93","sale_price":"41.93"}},"categories":["climbing","mountaineering-gear","avalanche-safety-gear"]}
