{"sku":"857907","manufacturer_id":"R130202801147","brand_name":"Ride","product_name":" Ride Compact Snowboard - Women's - 2013/2014","long_description":"With a rockered profile, built-in pop and lightweight construction, the Ride Compact women's snowboard offers a lively, fun ride through the park. LowRize(TM) rocker provides optimal hook-free goodness and allows you to lock in big landings without the fear of \"rocker washout\". Twin shape places you in a centered stance for a balanced ride whether riding regular or switch. Tuned wood core is highly durable, and retains pop and flex for long-lasting performance; woven fiberglass contributes to a fun, forgiving ride. Skate-inspired Slimewalls(R) sidewalls absorb impact and smooth the interaction between the board and the wood, metal and snowy surfaces you slide on. Edges contain nearly 50% more steel than standard snowboard edges, resulting in unmatched resistance to edge cracking; edges can be \"detuned\" to enlarge board's turning radii. Ride Compact women's snowboard features a Fusion 1500 extruded base that absorbs wax well and is easy to repair. .","short_description":"With a rockered profile, built-in pop and lightweight construction, the Ride Compact women's snowboard offers a lively, fun ride through the park.","category":"Snowboarding","subcategory":"Snowboards","product_group":"Freestyle Snowboards","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s342543.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l342543.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=342543&tt=df","retail_price":"359.95","sale_price":"215.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=342543\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m342543.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=857907&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8579070001":{"sku":"8579070001","vendor_sku":"R130202801147","upc":"886745172246","size":"147 CM","retail_price":"215.83","sale_price":"215.83"},"8579070002":{"sku":"8579070002","vendor_sku":"R130202801150","upc":"886745172260","size":"150 CM","retail_price":"215.83","sale_price":"215.83"}},"categories":["snow","snowboards","freestyle-snowboards"]}
