{"sku":"861909","manufacturer_id":"HZ176","brand_name":"Skilogik","product_name":"SKILOGIK Howitzer Skis - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Built with a gorgeous wood veneer, the SKILOGIK Howitzer skis use dual carbon layers for stability and manueverable rockered tips to blast through crud, float on powder and turn quickly on hard snow. Rockered tips are easy to maneuver and offer excellent flotation in soft snow, and standard camber underfoot offers grip on groomed runs. Construction consists of a hardwood core layered in a composite with 2 layers of carbon, topped with an eye-pleasing wood veneer that speaks to deep craftsmanship. Double layers of carbon fiber enhance stiffness and reduce overall weight. Complementary wood cores ensure that your left ski and right ski have a matched flex pattern. Black locust hardwood sidewalls offer extra grip. The SKILOGIK Howitzer skis feature 110mm waists that require wide bindings. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.","short_description":"Built with a gorgeous wood veneer, the SKILOGIK Howitzer skis use dual carbon layers for stability and manueverable rockered tips to blast through crud, float on powder and turn quickly on hard snow.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382351.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382351.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382351&tt=df","retail_price":"780.00","sale_price":"623.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382351\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382351.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=861909&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8619090001":{"sku":"8619090001","vendor_sku":"HZ176","upc":"486190900014","size":"176 CM","color":"DARK BROWN/LIGHT BROWN","retail_price":"623.93","sale_price":"623.93"},"8619090002":{"sku":"8619090002","vendor_sku":"HZ186","upc":"486190900021","size":"186 CM","color":"DARK BROWN/LIGHT BROWN","retail_price":"623.93","sale_price":"623.93"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
