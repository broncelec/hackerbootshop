Sturdy high-tensile steel frame is almost as tough as they are and is designed to stand up to demanding use. Rear coaster brake is easy and intuitive to use; simply backpedaling engages the brake. Removable training wheels and built-in full-length chainguard help kids learn to ride without fear of tipping over or catching pants in the chain. BMX-style handlebar is comfortable and fun; pads enhance safety and the front mud guard helps keep things clean. Convenient handle is integrated into the back of the saddle for easy carrying or control.
