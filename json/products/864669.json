{"sku":"864669","manufacturer_id":"033958-505-1-SM","brand_name":"Osprey","product_name":"Osprey Exos 58 Pack","long_description":"The redesigned Osprey Exos 58 Pack adds even more comfort and support with an improved harness and hipbelt, and offers new materials and hardware for lighter weight on your multiday backpacking trip. Ultralight and supportive, this pack offers the best of both worlds; its airy suspension is both light and comfortable for superlight backpacking and thru-hiking. Ventilated and supportive shoulder harness is made with slotted, mesh-covered foam; it features an adjustable sternum strap, built-in whistle and a pocket for energy gel. Mesh-covered, slotted-foam hipbelt tightens with an ergonomic, forward-pull cinch closure. Breathable, tensioned-mesh back panel pushes air to the sides for ventilation. 6061-T6 aluminum peripheral hoop frame effectively shifts load weight to the lumbar pad and hipbelt. Removable lid and over-the-top compression straps secure the main compartment; integrated FlapJacket(TM) deploys to offer weather protection when you're going lidless. Hydration-compatible design places the reservoir (sold separately) in a cavity behind the back panel for easy refilling. Ultralight compression straps on the sides take up extra volume without adding too much weight. Front and side stretch woven pockets, zippered mesh hipbelt pockets and an under-lid pocket make it easy to organize and access often-used items and snacks. The Osprey Exos 58 Pack features removable sleeping-pad straps; tool attachment features cord tie-offs that let you strap an ice axe or other tool to the outside of the pack.","short_description":"The redesigned Osprey Exos 58 Pack adds even more comfort and support with an improved harness and hipbelt, and offers new materials and hardware for lighter weight on your multiday backpacking trip.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Backpacks","product_group":"Backpacking Packs","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s410863.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l410863.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=410863&tt=df","keywords":"multiday","retail_price":"219.95","sale_price":"219.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=410863\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m410863.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=864669&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8646690003":{"sku":"8646690003","vendor_sku":"033958-505-3-LG","upc":"877257031701","size":"L","color":"BASALT BLACK","retail_price":"219.95","sale_price":"219.95"},"8646690005":{"sku":"8646690005","vendor_sku":"033958-613-2-MD","upc":"877257031725","size":"M","color":"PACIFIC BLUE","retail_price":"219.95","sale_price":"219.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","backpacks","backpacking-packs"]}
