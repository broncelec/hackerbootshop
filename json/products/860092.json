{"sku":"860092","manufacturer_id":"10772100066","brand_name":"Anon","product_name":" Anon M1 Premium Snow Goggles","long_description":"With a magnet-based interchangeable lens system and fresh style, the Anon M1 Premium snow goggles will have you looking the part as you carve up the mountain. Cobalt Smoke lens has a dark gray tint with 6% visible light transmission (VLT) to maximize color definition and increase depth perception in medium to bright light. Included Blue Lagoon spare lens has a high-contrast yellow tint, 68% VLT and a multilayer blue mirror finish to enhance color definition and increase contrast in low light. Interchangeable lens design features magnets in the frame and lenses, making it a simple process to swap lenses without taking the goggles off your face. To swap lenses, simply pull one lens out and snap the new one in-the magnets automatically guide and hold the lens in position. Large spherical lens tapers from the optical center toward the periphery for a wide field of vision with minimal distortion. Antifog treatment and full-perimeter venting combat lens fogging. 3-layer face foam is constructed of a dense base, a plush mid layer and a soft fleece top layer; design ensures a tight seal, good moisture management and maximum comfort. Tough thermoplastic polyurethane frame offers consistent flexibility in changing temperatures for a comfortable, secure fit. Strap outriggers hinge to create a flush fit that minimizes gaps and distributes pressure evenly across your face. The helmet-compatible design fits medium-size faces; goggles come with a protective nylon case and microfiber storage bag. As part of the Anon Premium series, the M1 Premium goggles feature the latest in high-resolution graphics and detailed frame and strap finishes.","short_description":"With a magnet-based interchangeable lens system and fresh style, the Anon M1 Premium snow goggles will have you looking the part as you carve up the mountain.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Goggles","product_group":"Men's Ski Goggles","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s381019.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l381019.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=381019&tt=df","retail_price":"219.95","sale_price":"153.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=381019\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m381019.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=860092&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8600920001":{"sku":"8600920001","vendor_sku":"10772100066","upc":"886888504072","size":"COBALT SMOKE","color":"LEGION","retail_price":"153.83","sale_price":"153.83"}},"categories":["snow","ski-goggles","mens-ski-goggles"]}
