Simply flick the lock open, set the length and flick the lock closed-a quick, tight and easily accomplished task, even with gloved hands. Handles feature natural cork and dual-density rubber tops for a solid grip; cork molds to fit your hands over time and absorbs sweat. Grips feature a 15deg corrective angle that keeps your wrists in a neutral position for comfort and performance; it also helps prevent repetitive-motion injury and fatigue. Sturdy carbide pole tips aid traction and can be exchanged with rubber tips (sold separately); trekking and powder baskets (included) let you use poles year around. The Black Diamond Trail Ergo Cork Trekking Poles feature padded, adjustable wrist straps that lend security and support.","short_description":"The Black Diamond Trail Ergo Cork Trekking Poles help keep you going in every season with mountain-goat sure-footedness and ease of use.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Gadgets","product_group":"Trekking Poles And Hiking Staffs","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s418939.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l418939.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=418939&tt=df","keywords":"collapsible","retail_price":"119.95","sale_price":"119.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=418939\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m418939.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=863073&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8630730001":{"sku":"8630730001","vendor_sku":"BD1121530000ALL","upc":"793661198604","size":"74 CM-140 CM","color":"FIRE RED","retail_price":"119.95","sale_price":"119.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","gadgets","trekking-poles-and-hiking-staffs"]}
