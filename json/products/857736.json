Boa(R) Coiler lacing system, with ankle and cable guides along entire edge of eyestays, distributes closure force evenly for a dialed-in fit that won't loosen up. Boa lacing offers on-the-fly adjustment and never comes untied; you get consistent closure without pressure points. TriFit-X thermal liners feature asymmetric X-Cage inserts that lock your heels in place; low-volume soles help you feel connected to the board. Liners can be custom-molded at your local REI store for a personalized fit. Fleece-lined upper cuffs offer warmth; flexible toe boxes help the boots feel more like shoes when you're walking or hiking. Cuffs flex easily for enhanced board control when carving; wrap-around design offers a secure closure around your ankles and calves. Instep articulation offers a forgiving forward flex while maintaining support. Dual-density EVA footbeds feature integrated arch support and dual-density metatarsal and heel impact-relief pads. Cushioned rubber outsoles feature an inverted waffle tread patten design for increased traction.","short_description":"A proven performer, Vans Encore snowboarding boots feature Boa(R) lacing for a dialed fit and custom moldable liners that lock down your heels so you can crank turns without heel lift.","category":"Snowboarding","subcategory":"Snowboard Boots","product_group":"Men's Snowboard Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s383103.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l383103.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=383103&tt=df","retail_price":"199.95","sale_price":"118.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=383103\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m383103.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=857736&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8577360001":{"sku":"8577360001","vendor_sku":"VN-0NFM82S","upc":"887682047567","size":"8.5","color":"BLACK/WHITE","retail_price":"118.83","sale_price":"118.83"},"8577360002":{"sku":"8577360002","vendor_sku":"VN-0NFM82S","upc":"887682047598","size":"9","color":"BLACK/WHITE","retail_price":"118.83","sale_price":"118.83"},"8577360003":{"sku":"8577360003","vendor_sku":"VN-0NFM82S","upc":"887682047581","size":"9.5","color":"BLACK/WHITE","retail_price":"118.83","sale_price":"118.83"},"8577360004":{"sku":"8577360004","vendor_sku":"VN-0NFM82S","upc":"887682047574","size":"10","color":"BLACK/WHITE","retail_price":"118.83","sale_price":"118.83"},"8577360006":{"sku":"8577360006","vendor_sku":"VN-0NFM82S","upc":"887682047475","size":"11","color":"BLACK/WHITE","retail_price":"118.83","sale_price":"118.83"},"8577360007":{"sku":"8577360007","vendor_sku":"VN-0NFM82S","upc":"887682047482","size":"11.5","color":"BLACK/WHITE","retail_price":"118.83","sale_price":"118.83"},"8577360008":{"sku":"8577360008","vendor_sku":"VN-0NFM82S","upc":"887682047499","size":"12","color":"BLACK/WHITE","retail_price":"118.83","sale_price":"118.83"},"8577360009":{"sku":"8577360009","vendor_sku":"VN-0NFM82S","upc":"887682047505","size":"13","color":"BLACK/WHITE","retail_price":"118.83","sale_price":"118.83"}},"categories":["snow","snowboard-boots","mens-snowboard-boots"]}
