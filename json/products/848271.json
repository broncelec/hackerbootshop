{"sku":"848271","manufacturer_id":"526","brand_name":"Sea To Summit","product_name":" Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil View Dry Sack","long_description":"The Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil View dry sack features a clear thermoplastic urethane window that lets you easily view the contents inside so you can quickly get to the gear you need. Using a polyurethane coated, 30-denier siliconized nylon, fabric is waterproof, lightweight and durable for hiking and backpacking in wet conditions. Polyurethane coating on the inside offers the ultimate in waterproofness; seams are reinforced for strength and factory-taped for weatherproof protection. Trimming weight, Sea to Summit uses a lightweight side release buckle and a thinner roll top closure. Hypalon(R) watertight roll-top closure keeps contents secure and protected; fold the Hypalon strip down first and make at least 3 rolls before closing the buckle. Roll-top fabric sacks are not intended for complete submersion; sensitive electronic devices should be double-bagged or packed in a waterproof hard case for maximum protection. Comes in assorted colors only; sorry, specific color requests cannot be accommodated.","short_description":"The Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil View dry sack features a clear thermoplastic urethane window that lets you easily view the contents inside so you can quickly get to the gear you need.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Gear Storage And Maintenance","product_group":"Stuff Sacks","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s419351.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l419351.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=419351&tt=df","retail_price":"34.95","sale_price":"34.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=419351\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m419351.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=848271&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8482710001":{"sku":"8482710001","vendor_sku":"523","size":"4 LTR","color":"ASST COLORS","retail_price":"19.95","sale_price":"19.95"},"8482710002":{"sku":"8482710002","vendor_sku":"524","size":"8 LTR","color":"ASST COLORS","retail_price":"24.95","sale_price":"24.95"},"8482710003":{"sku":"8482710003","vendor_sku":"525","size":"13 LTR","color":"ASST COLORS","retail_price":"29.95","sale_price":"29.95"},"8482710004":{"sku":"8482710004","vendor_sku":"526","size":"20 LTR","color":"ASST COLORS","retail_price":"34.95","sale_price":"34.95"}}}
