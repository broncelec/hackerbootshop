{"sku":"854626","manufacturer_id":"29436","brand_name":"Patagonia","product_name":"Patagonia Rubicon Rider Insulated Jacket - Men's","long_description":"When your riding takes you down the coldest of slopes, the Patagonia Rubicon Rider jacket delivers loads of warm insulation to keep you in your cozy comfort zone as you plow through the pow. Jacket features a hybrid construction, with the ripstop polyester shell featuring Deluge(R) Durable Water Repellent coating, which is highly water resistant and breathable. Shoulders, elbows and bottom hem are reinforced with two-layer waterproof, breathable H2No(R) panels to prevent wet-through and increase durability at critical points. 150g synthetic insulation (90% of which is recycled material) provides insulating warmth, even if it gets damp; it also compresses easily for compact stowing. Embedded RECCO(R) reflector enhances radio signals from search-and-rescue RECCO detectors, helping speed up the search for a buried avalanche victim. Removable, helmet-compatible hood can be easily adjusted with just one hand; collar is lined with soft microfleece at back of neck and at chin for next-to-skin comfort. Adjustable powder skirt features webbing loops that connect to compatible ski or snowboard pants to keep snow out (pants sold separately). Zippered handwarmer pockets; zippered chest pockets (one with cable routing); one internal zip stash pocket and an internal open pocket for your goggles. Drawcord hem seals out drafts and can be adjusted from within the front pockets; rip-and-stick cuffs fit over or under gloves and adjust comfortably around your wrists. Pit zippers on the Patagonia Rubicon Rider insulated jacket let you control your comfort; articulated sleeves enable easy movement.","short_description":"When your riding takes you down the coldest of slopes, the Patagonia Rubicon Rider jacket delivers loads of warm insulation to keep you in your cozy comfort zone as you plow through the pow.","category":"Men's Clothing","subcategory":"Men's Jackets","product_group":"Men's Insulated Jackets","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s401607.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l401607.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=401607&tt=df","retail_price":"299.00","sale_price":"208.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=401607\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m401607.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=854626&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8546260001":{"sku":"8546260001","vendor_sku":"29436","upc":"887187253166","size":"S","color":"FORGE GREY","retail_price":"208.93","sale_price":"208.93"},"8546260003":{"sku":"8546260003","vendor_sku":"29436","upc":"887187253203","size":"L","color":"FORGE GREY","retail_price":"208.93","sale_price":"208.93"},"8546260004":{"sku":"8546260004","vendor_sku":"29436","upc":"887187253234","size":"XL","color":"FORGE GREY","retail_price":"208.93","sale_price":"208.93"},"8546260007":{"sku":"8546260007","vendor_sku":"29436","upc":"887187124053","size":"L","color":"GOLDENROD","retail_price":"208.93","sale_price":"208.93"},"8546260010":{"sku":"8546260010","vendor_sku":"29436","upc":"887187122578","size":"M","color":"CAPTAIN'S BLUE","retail_price":"166.83","sale_price":"166.83"},"8546260011":{"sku":"8546260011","vendor_sku":"29436","upc":"887187122608","size":"L","color":"CAPTAIN'S BLUE","retail_price":"166.83","sale_price":"166.83"},"8546260012":{"sku":"8546260012","vendor_sku":"29436","upc":"887187122639","size":"XL","color":"CAPTAIN'S BLUE","retail_price":"166.83","sale_price":"166.83"}},"categories":["mens","mens-jackets","mens-insulated-jackets"]}
