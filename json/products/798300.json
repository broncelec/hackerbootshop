{"sku":"798300","manufacturer_id":"TS09","brand_name":"Sole","product_name":"SOLE Thin Sport Custom Footbeds","long_description":"The heat-moldable SOLE Thin Sport custom footbeds are designed to be used in low-volume footwear like ski boots and cycling shoes, offering support and stability underfoot. Heat-moldable 3-layer design ensures personal fit and ample support to reduce stress and foot fatigue. Deep heel cup and customized arch support help maintain stability and proper knee-to-ankle alignment to reduce fatigue and pain. Also helps to support stabilizer muscles, which means more energy is dedicated to the muscles generating power. Custom fit helps eliminate pressure points by supporting the arch and distributing weight evenly to increase blood flow and reduce numbness. Can be worn with or without heat-molding to achieve the proper amount of support and a custom shape. Wicking, perforated polyester topsheets manage moisture and balance friction control with comfort. EVA heat-moldable foam base supplies lightweight cushioning and a custom shape. Easy molding: warm footbeds in 200degF oven for about 2 minutes, then remove and place inside footwear. Opti-Therm Molding indicator makes custom fitting a snap-indicator turns black when insoles are ready to be removed from oven. To finish the process, step into the footwear and stand straight with feet shoulder width apart for 2 minutes. .","short_description":"The heat-moldable SOLE Thin Sport custom footbeds are designed to be used in low-volume footwear like ski boots and cycling shoes, offering support and stability underfoot.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Footwear Accessories","product_group":"Insoles","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s376643.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l376643.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=376643&tt=df","keywords":"shoe inserts","retail_price":"45.00","sale_price":"45.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=376643\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m376643.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=798300&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7983000014":{"sku":"7983000014","vendor_sku":"TS05","upc":"730716311137","size":"5","color":"Silver","retail_price":"45.00","sale_price":"45.00"},"7983000022":{"sku":"7983000022","vendor_sku":"TS06","upc":"730716311144","size":"6","color":"Silver","retail_price":"45.00","sale_price":"45.00"},"7983000030":{"sku":"7983000030","vendor_sku":"TS07","upc":"730716311151","size":"7","color":"Silver","retail_price":"45.00","sale_price":"45.00"},"7983000048":{"sku":"7983000048","vendor_sku":"TS08","upc":"730716311168","size":"8","color":"Silver","retail_price":"45.00","sale_price":"45.00"},"7983000063":{"sku":"7983000063","vendor_sku":"TS10","upc":"730716311182","size":"10","color":"Silver","retail_price":"45.00","sale_price":"45.00"},"7983000071":{"sku":"7983000071","vendor_sku":"TS11","upc":"730716311199","size":"11","color":"Silver","retail_price":"45.00","sale_price":"45.00"},"7983000089":{"sku":"7983000089","vendor_sku":"TS12","upc":"730716311205","size":"12","color":"Silver","retail_price":"45.00","sale_price":"45.00"},"7983000097":{"sku":"7983000097","vendor_sku":"TS13","upc":"730716311212","size":"13","color":"Silver","retail_price":"45.00","sale_price":"45.00"}},"categories":["footwear","footwear-accessories","insoles"]}
