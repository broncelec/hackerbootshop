Tough nylon with Gore-Tex Pro Shell laminate is completely waterproof, extremely breathable and highly durable. Tough reinforcements at knees and seat boost abrasion resistance and durability; fabric patches on exterior of Gore-Tex are self-draining. Neoprene neck gasket seals with skin to help keep water out. Storable storm hood features adjustable drawstring and reflective tape; hood is designed to work with a paddling helmet. Adjustable neoprene band keeps suit snugly fitted around midsection using 2 large rip-and-stick tabs. Sleeve pockets on each arm store small essentials. Specialized sleeves enhance freedom of motion and won't restrict movement when paddling. Waterproof front-entry zipper eases dressing and relief zipper speeds pit stops. Adjustable leg and arm cuffs with rip-and-stick closures dial in the fit; arm cuffs have latex gaskets to enhance protection. Reflective highlights on front of suit enhance visibility in low light. Integrated Gore-Tex socks are more comfortable than latex gaskets and prevent water from entering suit at legs. Machine or hand wash in cold water with powdered detergent; do not bleach or dry clean; store dry, hanging or loosely folded.","short_description":"The men's Kokatat Gore-Tex(R) Expedition dry suit lets you paddle where others can't.","category":"Paddling","subcategory":"Paddling Clothing","product_group":"Dry Suits","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s431503.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l431503.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=431503&tt=df","retail_price":"1155.00","sale_price":"1155.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=431503\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m431503.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=832611&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8326110001":{"sku":"8326110001","vendor_sku":"DSUEXPAZ2","upc":"606891029627","size":"S","color":"AZUL/GRAY","retail_price":"1155.00","sale_price":"1155.00"},"8326110002":{"sku":"8326110002","vendor_sku":"DSUEXPAZ3","upc":"606891029634","size":"M","color":"AZUL/GRAY","retail_price":"1155.00","sale_price":"1155.00"},"8326110003":{"sku":"8326110003","vendor_sku":"DSUEXPAZ4","upc":"606891029641","size":"L","color":"AZUL/GRAY","retail_price":"1155.00","sale_price":"1155.00"},"8326110004":{"sku":"8326110004","vendor_sku":"DSUEXPAZ5","upc":"606891029658","size":"XL","color":"AZUL/GRAY","retail_price":"1155.00","sale_price":"1155.00"}},"categories":["paddling","paddling-clothing","dry-suits"]}
