{"sku":"813902","manufacturer_id":"RX-921LSE","brand_name":"Serfas","product_name":" Serfas RX Saddle - Men's","long_description":"The Serfas RX saddle keeps you sitting tall and spinning for hours in well-designed comfort. Serfas RX saddle is medically tested and proven to reduce cycling-related discomfort and numbness. A groove from tip to tail shifts rider's weight to inner thighs and buttocks, avoiding contact with the perineum, relieving pelvic discomfort. Also, the majority of rider weight is placed on the rear of the saddle, further reducing pressure against the perineal artery. Patented dual-density technology uses molded rubber inserts on base for shock absorption and an extra layer of Reactive Gel for added comfort. Hard frame provides excellent support and allows for increased ventilation. Men's saddle is slightly narrower than the women's, with a slightly longer nose.","short_description":"The Serfas RX saddle keeps you sitting tall and spinning for hours in well-designed comfort.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Components","product_group":"Bike Saddles And Seatposts","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s388883.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l388883.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=388883&tt=df","retail_price":"55.95","sale_price":"55.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=388883\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m388883.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=813902&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8139020001":{"sku":"8139020001","vendor_sku":"RX-921LSE","upc":"713835015933","retail_price":"55.95","sale_price":"55.95"}}}
