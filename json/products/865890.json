{"sku":"865890","manufacturer_id":"630-00101-02","brand_name":"Revolights","product_name":"Revolights City v2.0 Bike Wheel Lights","long_description":"Cutting-edge Revolights City v2.0 bike wheel lights use bright LEDs to create fluid arcs of light as your wheels spin to Illuminate the road ahead and boost safety with 360deg of visibility. Smart rings of LEDs synchronize to your speed to create a legal headlight, functional brakelight and true 360deg visiblity for your bike. Unlike traditional headlights, which have a single point of light, Revolights throw a wide vertical swath, illuminating not only the ground but also elevated objects. Low origin point of light helps you to determine the height of obstacles in the road by the length of their shadows. Light is visible from 360deg, increasing visibility from all angles of approach. Weather-resistant design stands up to wet road conditions; 4-hr. battery recharges via micro-USB charger. Designed for road and hybrid 700 series (700c / 622mm / 24.5 in.) and 27 in. rims only. Fits up to 40mm rim-to-nipple depth. White lights in front; red lights in back. Includes 4 LED hoops, 2 rechargeable battery packs, 2 fork magnets, 12 spacers, 12 clips and installation instructions.","short_description":"Cutting-edge Revolights City v2.0 bike wheel lights use bright LEDs to create fluid arcs of light as your wheels spin to Illuminate the road ahead and boost safety with 360deg of visibility.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Accessories","product_group":"Bike Lights","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s375679.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l375679.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=375679&tt=df","keywords":"glow,flashing","retail_price":"229.00","sale_price":"229.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=375679\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m375679.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=865890&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8658900001":{"sku":"8658900001","vendor_sku":"630-00101-01","upc":"850944005001","size":"18-25 MM","color":"BLACK/MATTE","retail_price":"229.00","sale_price":"229.00"},"8658900002":{"sku":"8658900002","vendor_sku":"630-00101-02","upc":"850944005018","size":"26-30 MM","color":"BLACK/MATTE","retail_price":"229.00","sale_price":"229.00"},"8658900003":{"sku":"8658900003","vendor_sku":"630-00101-03","upc":"850944005025","size":"31-37 MM","color":"BLACK/MATTE","retail_price":"229.00","sale_price":"229.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-accessories","bike-lights"]}
