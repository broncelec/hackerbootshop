{"sku":"861835","manufacturer_id":"IS166","brand_name":"Skilogik","product_name":" SKILOGIK Isis RL Skis - Women's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Built for versatility from the frontside of the mountain to the deep stuff, the women's SKILOGIK Isis RL skis offer women skiers a beautifully-crafted wood veneer and easy-to-turn rockered tips. Rockered tips are easy to maneuver and offer excellent flotation in soft snow, and the relatively tight sidecut radius offers the versatility to carve groomers. The Isis RL skis are sculpted from the same top-end materials as all other SKILOGIK skis, but scaled proportionately to cater to the performance of women skiers. Construction consists of a hardwood core layered in a composite of carbon and fiberglass, topped with an eye-pleasing wood veneer that speaks to beautiful craftsmanship. Complementary wood cores ensure that your left ski and right ski have a matched flex pattern. Black locust hardwood sidewalls offer extra grip. 92mm waists require bindings with wide brakes. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.","short_description":"Built for versatility from the frontside of the mountain to the deep stuff, the women's SKILOGIK Isis RL skis offer women skiers a beautifully-crafted wood veneer and easy-to-turn rockered tips.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382335.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382335.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382335&tt=df","retail_price":"750.00","sale_price":"599.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382335\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382335.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=861835&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8618350001":{"sku":"8618350001","vendor_sku":"IS158","upc":"486183500016","size":"158 CM","color":"LIGHT BROWN/ORANGE/YELLOW","retail_price":"599.93","sale_price":"599.93"},"8618350002":{"sku":"8618350002","vendor_sku":"IS166","upc":"486183500023","size":"166 CM","color":"LIGHT BROWN/ORANGE/YELLOW","retail_price":"599.93","sale_price":"599.93"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
