{"sku":"859503","manufacturer_id":"J131600901295","brand_name":"Full Tilt","product_name":" Full Tilt Classic Ski Boots - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"It's hard to beat an original. The Full Tilt Classic ski boots offer intermediate downhillers responsive power, retro looks and a time-tested, 3-piece shell. Separate cuff, shell and tongue sections together create a classic fit and one-of-a-kind flex. 3-piece shell design allows the use of thin plastic to reduce overall weight, ensures an even flex pattern with specialized tongues. 7 ribs (separate sections) on tongues provide an even, uniform flex, and cables work like shoelaces to even out pressure and reduce shin bang. Tongues hinge out of the way making it a breeze to get your feet in the boots. Liners feature 7mm medium-density foam that molds to your feet through use, but they can also be custom molded using a heat treatment in an REI specialty ski shop. Additional layers of foam around the cuffs enhance power transfer to shell. Ratcheting buckles offer on-the-fly adjustments, and rigid bootboards enhance the feel of snow under your feet. Full Tilt Classic ski boots provide the responsive power transfer preferred by fast intermediate skiers; Full Tilt rates their flex as a 6 out of 10. 99mm footbed provides a responsive, precision fit.","short_description":"It's hard to beat an original.
