{"sku":"862620","manufacturer_id":"T-2300","brand_name":"Kinetic","product_name":"Kinetic Rock And Roll 2.0 Bike Trainer","long_description":"The Kinetic Rock And Roll 2.0 Bike Trainer offers quiet, fluid-based progressive resistance with a unique feature-a pivot that replicates side-to-side motion to help improve technique. Side-to-side motion engages core muscles to maintain balance and lets you refine your technique when simulating out-of-the-saddle hill climbs. Quiet, smooth, progressive resistance replicates the feel of an outdoor ride: as you pedal faster, the resistance increases thanks to a leak-proof fluid mechanism. Rubberized, grippy knobs and sturdy design offer excellent stability. The Kinetic Rock And Roll 2.0 Bike Trainer features a larger-than-average roller to reduce tire wear. Compatible with all bikes with 22 - 29 in. diameter wheels and up to 29 x 2.4 in. tires. Range of resistance from 5 - 3,000 watts.","short_description":"The Kinetic Rock And Roll 2.0 Bike Trainer offers quiet, fluid-based progressive resistance with a unique feature-a pivot that replicates side-to-side motion to help improve technique.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Accessories","product_group":"Bike Trainers","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s379583.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l379583.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=379583&tt=df","retail_price":"539.00","sale_price":"539.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=379583\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m379583.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=862620&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8626200001":{"sku":"8626200001","vendor_sku":"T-2300","upc":"851061001211","color":"GREEN","retail_price":"539.00","sale_price":"539.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-accessories","bike-trainers"]}
