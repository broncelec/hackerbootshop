{"sku":"855595","manufacturer_id":"1108002","brand_name":"Time","product_name":" Time Xpresso 2 Bike Pedals","long_description":"Fast and easy to get in and out of, Time Xpresso 2 bike pedals offer a stable, secure and efficient platform at a great value. Instead of metal springs, flexible carbon fiber blades tension the retention mechanisms, ensuring a secure pedal connection while reducing weight. Getting into the pedals is a breeze, thanks to the low-tension engagement of the retention mechanism: step in with little pressure, pedal engages cleat, and then pedal away! Excellent foot-to-pedal stability and solid power transfer is achieved through the oversize pedal platform and low stack height (distance from shoe sole to pedal axle). Sturdy composite pedal bodies spin smoothly around steel axles. Foot/pedal interface can be tuned and optimized, offering adjustment to Q-factor (side-to-side), +/-5deg of angular float and 2.5mm of lateral float; 15deg release angle. Time Xpresso 2 bike pedals come with cleats and mounting hardware; compatible with most road cycling shoes with 3-hole mounts.","short_description":"Fast and easy to get in and out of, Time Xpresso 2 bike pedals offer a stable, secure and efficient platform at a great value.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Components","product_group":"Bike Pedals","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s455287.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l455287.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=455287&tt=df","retail_price":"75.00","sale_price":"75.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=455287\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m455287.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=855595&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8555950001":{"sku":"8555950001","vendor_sku":"1108002","upc":"485559500018","retail_price":"75.00","sale_price":"75.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-components","bike-pedals"]}
