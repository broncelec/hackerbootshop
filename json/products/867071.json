{"sku":"867071","manufacturer_id":"BD2622130000ALL","brand_name":"Black Diamond","product_name":"Black Diamond Camalot X4 Offset Cam","long_description":"Built to protect where other cams can't, the Black Diamond Camalot X4 Offset Cam merges the vast expansion range of Camalots with an offset lobe design for pin scars and other non-uniform cracks. Offset design features larger cam lobes on one side to fit securely in non-uniform placements, such as pin scars and flaring cracks. Embedded cam springs allow for a super-narrow head width, and the flexible stem features aluminum protection beads to protect the cable without compromising flexibility. Double axle design on the 0.5/0.75 and 0.4/0.5 sizes and Stacked Axle Technology on the 0.3/0.4, 0.2/0.3 and 0.1/0.2 sizes provide huge expansion ranges. Symmetric swage and hot-forged trigger bar provide strength and ergonomic handling. Black Diamond Camalot X4 Offset Cam has anodized outside lobes and a lightweight, yet durable color-coded Dyneema sling for easy identification and differentiation.","short_description":"Built to protect where other cams can't, the Black Diamond Camalot X4 Offset Cam merges the vast expansion range of Camalots with an offset lobe design for pin scars and other non-uniform cracks.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Protection","product_group":"Cams","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s458243.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l458243.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=458243&tt=df","retail_price":"69.95","sale_price":"69.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=458243\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m458243.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=867071&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{},"extended_xml_attributes":"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t","categories":["climbing","climbing-protection","cams"]}
