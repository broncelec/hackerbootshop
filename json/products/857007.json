{"sku":"857007","manufacturer_id":"7023112","brand_name":"Giro","product_name":"Giro Slingshot Snow Helmet - Boys'","long_description":"The boys' Giro Slingshot snow helmet armors his head in top-end protection and a light, durable design. It's easy to fit and sports soft, cozy lining to keep him comfy while he rocks the slopes. In-mold construction fuses a tough, ventilated polycarbonate shell with an impact-absorbing foam liner, resulting in a helmet that is lighter and cooler than many others. Super Cool(TM) vents invite cool, fresh air into the helmet while pushing hot, stale air out; optimized vent shapes help regulate temperature to keep him feeling fresh. The Giro Slingshot snow helmet complies with ASTM F 2040 and/or CE EN 1077 alpine ski and snowboard helmet standards.","short_description":"The boys' Giro Slingshot snow helmet armors his head in top-end protection and a light, durable design.
