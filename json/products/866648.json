Snap-Back(TM) Interchange lens system lets you switch lenses to accommodate a variety of light conditions and activities (extra lenses not included). Polarized lenses reduce 99% of visible glare from water, snow, sand and pavement for increased visual acuity and decreased eye strain. Polarized Crystal Carbonate(R) (P.C.C.) lenses protect against scratching and block 100% of harmful UVA and UVB light. Asphalt and White Front frames feature gray-tint lenses, ideal for bright sunny days. Maple Tort frames feature brown-tint lenses for enhanced contrast in flat light. Tough thermoplastic frames endure extreme highs and lows in temperature; cam-action spring hinges quickly lock temples in position. Venting system incorporated into the frames enhances airflow and virtually eliminates fog and condensation. Self-adjusting nosepads and grippy temple tips create a nonslip fit that keeps sunglasses in place. The Native Eyewear Gonzo Polarized Sunglasses are sized to best fit large to extra large profiles.
