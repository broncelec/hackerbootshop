{"sku":"845338","manufacturer_id":"BD681089COALS_M","brand_name":"Black Diamond","product_name":"Black Diamond Nitro Pack","long_description":"The nimble and streamlined Black Diamond Nitro pack is a great choice for quick hikes and fast scrambles when you don't want unecessary weight and bulk to slow you down. Features a breathable back panel and soft, breathable 3D mesh on the hipbelt and shoulder straps for robust support and comfort. Innovative shoulder straps move in concert with a hiker's stride or a climber's reach by sliding through the bottom of the pack with a low-friction cable and housing. Shoulder straps are linked by the cable which helps maintain an even, balanced load across the shoulders. Zippered panel access makes it easy to pack and unpack your gear. Hipbelt pocket, front compression stretch pocket and side stretch pockets provide plenty of accessible storage options for water bottles, snacks and other essentials. Tool loops and compression straps accommodate trekking poles or an ice axe. Internal hydration sleeve holds a reservoir (not included). The Black Diamond Nitro pack is constructed of 210-denier ripstop nylon for excellent durability and light weight.","short_description":"The nimble and streamlined Black Diamond Nitro pack is a great choice for quick hikes and fast scrambles when you don't want unecessary weight and bulk to slow you down.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Backpacks","product_group":"Day Packs","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s411095.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l411095.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=411095&tt=df","retail_price":"119.95","sale_price":"119.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=411095\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m411095.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=845338&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8453380001":{"sku":"8453380001","vendor_sku":"BD681089COALS_M","upc":"793661176510","size":"S/M","color":"COAL","retail_price":"119.95","sale_price":"119.95"},"8453380002":{"sku":"8453380002","vendor_sku":"BD681089COALM_L","upc":"793661176527","size":"M/L","color":"COAL","retail_price":"119.95","sale_price":"119.95"},"8453380005":{"sku":"8453380005","vendor_sku":"BD681089DKDMS_M","upc":"793661176572","size":"S/M","color":"DARK DENIM","retail_price":"119.95","sale_price":"119.95"},"8453380006":{"sku":"8453380006","vendor_sku":"BD681089DKDMM_L","upc":"793661176589","size":"M/L","color":"DARK DENIM","retail_price":"119.95","sale_price":"119.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","backpacks","day-packs"]}
