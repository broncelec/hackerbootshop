{"sku":"721632","manufacturer_id":"EVU10","brand_name":"Sole","product_name":"SOLE Ed Viesturs Signature Series Custom Footbeds - High Volume","long_description":"These SOLE Ed Viesturs Signature Series custom footbeds can help relieve foot pain, soreness and excess motion in your larger-volume outdoor and athletic footwear. Tested in some of the most demanding conditions in the world by mountaineer Ed Viesturs, these footbeds work well in hiking, mountaineering and steel-toe boots. They also work great in high-volume (more room) running shoes. Heat-moldable three-layer design ensures a personalized fit and ample support to help control motion and absorb shock. Can be worn with or without heat-molding to achieve proper amount of support and custom shape. Wicking, perforated polyester top helps manage moisture and balance friction control with comfort. 3.2mm of SOFTEC open-cell urethane in middle layer delivers superior shock absorption and durability for long-term cushioning comfort. EVA heat-moldable foam base supplies lightweight cushioning and a custom shape. Easy molding: warm footbeds in 200degF oven for about two minutes, then remove and place inside footwear. Opti-Therm Molding indicator makes custom fitting a snap--indicator turns black when insoles are ready to be removed from oven. Finally, step into the footwear and stand straight with feet shoulder width apart for two minutes. Aggressive arch and deep heel cups offer support and pronation control for a plush yet static fit; hand-wash to clean. Please note: sizing of the SOLE Ed Viesturs Signature Series custom footbeds is based on US Men's sizes.","short_description":"These SOLE Ed Viesturs Signature Series custom footbeds can help relieve foot pain, soreness and excess motion in your larger-volume outdoor and athletic footwear.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Footwear Accessories","product_group":"Insoles","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s376611.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l376611.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=376611&tt=df","keywords":"shoe inserts","retail_price":"45.00","sale_price":"45.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=376611\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m376611.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=721632&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7216320031":{"sku":"7216320031","vendor_sku":"EVU05","upc":"730716151139","size":"5","color":"BLACK/BLUE","retail_price":"45.00","sale_price":"45.00"},"7216320049":{"sku":"7216320049","vendor_sku":"EVU06","upc":"730716151146","size":"6","color":"BLACK/BLUE","retail_price":"45.00","sale_price":"45.00"},"7216320056":{"sku":"7216320056","vendor_sku":"EVU07","upc":"730716151153","size":"7","color":"BLACK/BLUE","retail_price":"45.00","sale_price":"45.00"},"7216320064":{"sku":"7216320064","vendor_sku":"EVU08","upc":"730716151160","size":"8","color":"BLACK/BLUE","retail_price":"45.00","sale_price":"45.00"},"7216320072":{"sku":"7216320072","vendor_sku":"EVU09","upc":"730716151177","size":"9","color":"BLACK/BLUE","retail_price":"45.00","sale_price":"45.00"},"7216320080":{"sku":"7216320080","vendor_sku":"EVU10","upc":"730716151184","size":"10","color":"BLACK/BLUE","retail_price":"45.00","sale_price":"45.00"},"7216320098":{"sku":"7216320098","vendor_sku":"EVU11","upc":"730716151191","size":"11","color":"BLACK/BLUE","retail_price":"45.00","sale_price":"45.00"},"7216320106":{"sku":"7216320106","vendor_sku":"EVU12","upc":"730716151207","size":"12","color":"BLACK/BLUE","retail_price":"45.00","sale_price":"45.00"},"7216320114":{"sku":"7216320114","vendor_sku":"EVU13","upc":"730716151214","size":"13","color":"BLACK/BLUE","retail_price":"45.00","sale_price":"45.00"}},"categories":["footwear","footwear-accessories","insoles"]}
