{"sku":"827196","manufacturer_id":"A57ZMF2","brand_name":"The North Face","product_name":"The North Face Venture Rain Jacket - Men's","long_description":"Venture out and explore in just about any weather with The North Face Venture men's jacket. This lightweight jacket is engineered to withstand severe rain and styled for everyday use. The Venture jacket is a staple that every outdoor enthusiast will appreciate. HyVent(R) EC 2.5-layer substitutes natural (bean-derived) castor oil for 50% of the petroleum-based materials previously used in the manufacturing process. HyVent EC maintains excellent waterproof, breathable performance; it's ideal for spring skiing and snowboarding, as well as urban and city hiking. HyVent is lightweight and packable, moves easily over layers and is more breathable than unlined, treated fabrics. All seams are sealed for complete protection. Fully adjustable brimmed hood (with hidden drawcords) protects your head from precipitation and allows good visibility; soft lining guards chin against abrasion. Rip-and-stick stormflap prevents weather penetration through the full-length front zipper. Pit zippers allow cooling airflow as your activity heats up. Hem drawcord and elastic cuffs with rip-and-stick closures seal out the weather. Zip hand pockets; jacket stows in left pocket. The Venture jacket's regular cut eases layering, and slightly long length adds protection.","short_description":"Venture out and explore in just about any weather with The North Face Venture men's jacket.
