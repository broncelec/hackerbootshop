{"sku":"833850","manufacturer_id":"06IXRD01A","brand_name":"Klymit","product_name":" Klymit Inertia X-Frame Sleeping Pad","long_description":"The Klymit Inertia X-Frame sleeping pad features a unique cut out design and high pressurized comfort that makes it one of the thinnest, lightest and most compact sleeping pads. Klymit uses body mapping to support the key areas, such as the head and hips, and removes padding in less critical areas to reduce weight. Cutouts allow a bag's insulation to remain lofted, which maximizes warmth, rather than becoming compacted between your body and the pad. Inertia X-Frame pad can be inflated with just 2 - 4 breaths; to adjust firmness, use the included hand pump to increase air pressure in pad. Use it under or inside (so you'll never fall off) your sleeping bag. Pad includes a stuff sack, patch kit and dry air pump. Klymit Inertia X-Frame sleeping pad rolls up to the sized of a soda can for easy packing. Constructed from 30-denier ripstop nylon top and a 75-denier polyester bottom for durability.","short_description":"The Klymit Inertia X-Frame sleeping pad features a unique cut out design and high pressurized comfort that makes it one of the thinnest, lightest and most compact sleeping pads.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Pads, Cots And Hammocks","product_group":"Sleeping Pads","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s422175.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l422175.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=422175&tt=df","keywords":"mattress,mats","retail_price":"89.95","sale_price":"89.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=422175\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m422175.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=833850&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8338500001":{"sku":"8338500001","vendor_sku":"06IXRD01A","upc":"846647001204","size":"L","color":"CHARTREUSE","retail_price":"89.95","sale_price":"89.95"}}}
