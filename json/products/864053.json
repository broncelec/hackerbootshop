Thermal.Q(TM) synthetic insulation provides a European Norm (EN) comfort rating down to 31deg, making the Petaluma ideal for 3-season backpacking. Women-specific bag is cut to match a woman's shape, and provides extra insulation and warmth in the hood and feet areas. Offset quilt construction means no sewn-through seams and no cold spots. Tailored hood with face gasket forms around head to seal in heat. Comfort footbox allows feet to rest naturally, angled out slightly with toes pointing, while fully preserving insulation loft for maximum warmth. Insulated draft tube (backing the 2-way, full-length zipper) and insulated zipper gusset seal in heat. Note: EN is an independent third-party temperature rating, allowing accurate comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags.","short_description":"A great all-around backpacking sleeping bag for spring, summer and fall, the women's synthetic-fill Mountain Hardwear Petaluma(TM) is built for comfort and warmth without constriction.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags And Accessories","product_group":"Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s442347.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l442347.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=442347&tt=df","keywords":"compact","retail_price":"140.00","sale_price":"140.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=442347\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m442347.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=864053&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8640530002":{"sku":"8640530002","vendor_sku":"1502822443","upc":"786559903022","size":"Long Right","color":"JEWEL","retail_price":"140.00","sale_price":"140.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sleeping-bags-and-accessories","sleeping-bags"]}
