{"sku":"861837","manufacturer_id":"UC182","brand_name":"Skilogik","product_name":" SKILOGIK Ullr's Chariot RL Skis - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"All-mountain planks with eye-catching looks, SKILOGIK Ullr's Chariot RL skis use wide waists and rockered tips for soft snow and take on groomers with unusual grip for a rockered ski of its size. Rockered tips are easy to maneuver and offer excellent flotation in soft snow, and the relatively tight sidecut radius offers the versatility to carve groomers. Construction consists of a hardwood core layered in a composite of carbon and fiberglass, topped with an eye-pleasing wood veneer that speaks to beautiful craftsmanship. Complementary wood cores ensure that your left ski and right ski have a matched flex pattern. Black locust hardwood sidewalls offer extra grip. The 101mm waists of the SKILOGIK Ullr's Chariot RL skis require wide brakes. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.","short_description":"All-mountain planks with eye-catching looks, SKILOGIK Ullr's Chariot RL skis use wide waists and rockered tips for soft snow and take on groomers with unusual grip for a rockered ski of its size.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382343.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382343.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382343&tt=df","retail_price":"750.00","sale_price":"599.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382343\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382343.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=861837&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8618370001":{"sku":"8618370001","vendor_sku":"UC174","upc":"486183700010","size":"174 CM","color":"LIGHT BROWN/DARK BROWN","retail_price":"599.93","sale_price":"599.93"},"8618370002":{"sku":"8618370002","vendor_sku":"UC182","upc":"486183700027","size":"182 CM","color":"LIGHT BROWN/DARK BROWN","retail_price":"599.93","sale_price":"599.93"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
