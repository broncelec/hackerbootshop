{"sku":"859174","manufacturer_id":"722-4225","brand_name":"Dragon","product_name":"Dragon APXS Snow Goggles","long_description":"With a rimless design and oversized interchangeable lenses, the Dragon APXS snow goggles fit medium faces and maximize your peripheral vision so you can see all of the mountain below you. Lens tints accommodate a variety of light conditions from cloudy to sunny. Jet frame has a Green Ionized lens (bronze tint, 20-25% visible light transmission (VLT)) and a spare Yellow-Blue Ionized lens (yellow tint, 45-55% VLT). Interchangeable lens design makes it easy to swap lenses to meet the conditions-simply pop the existing lens off of the frame and snap in the replacement lens. Oversized spherical lens tapers from the optical center toward the periphery for an extra-wide field of vision with minimal distortion. Double-layer lens creates a thermal barrier between the cold outside air and the warm air around your face, helping reduce fogging. Anti-fog coating on inner lens and vents in both the frame and lens further combat fogging; scratch-resistant coating protects the outer lens from getting marred. Rimless frame helps maxmize your peripheral vision; resilient polyurethane frame material stays flexible in all temperatures, ensuring your comfort when the mercury drops. 3-layer face foam is constructed of a dense base, a plush mid layer and a soft fleece top layer; design ensures a tight seal, good moisture management and maximum comfort. The helmet-compatible Dragon APXS snow goggles are designed to fit medium-size faces.","short_description":"With a rimless design and oversized interchangeable lenses, the Dragon APXS snow goggles fit medium faces and maximize your peripheral vision so you can see all of the mountain below you.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Goggles","product_group":"Men's Ski Goggles","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s461259.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l461259.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=461259&tt=df","retail_price":"200.00","sale_price":"139.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=461259\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m461259.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859174&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8591740001":{"sku":"8591740001","vendor_sku":"722-4225","upc":"634741751138","size":"GREEN IONIZED","color":"JET","retail_price":"139.83","sale_price":"139.83"}},"categories":["snow","ski-goggles","mens-ski-goggles"]}
