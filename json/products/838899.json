Integrated reservoir compartment encapsulates a 72 fl. oz. reservoir in a manner that supports and stabilizes the water weight on the back. Quick-drying fabric wicks moisture and offers light insulation, and full-length zipper makes it easy to get in and out of the vest. Insulated pad helps prevent the water in the reservoir from freezing. Burst-resistant reservoir has an extra-large opening for easy filling and cleaning. HydroGuard(TM) technology inhibits bacterial growth on reservoir and tube surfaces (but does not protect user from disease organisms; please wash reservoir after each use).
