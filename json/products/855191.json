{"sku":"855191","manufacturer_id":"83646","brand_name":"Patagonia","product_name":"Patagonia Super Alpine Jacket - Men's","long_description":"The Patagonia Super Alpine jacket is a big-mountain jacket for alpine climbing or ski mountaineering in the worst possible conditions. It's your suit of armor for adventuresome ascents and descents. Extremely light but durable 3-layer Gore-Tex(R) Pro nylon shell; heavier-weight Gore-Tex Pro in key areas for reinforcement. Helmet-compatible, two-way-adjustable hood with laminated visor optimizes visibility in bad conditions. Front watertight zipper with an internal stormflap keeps the weather at bay while keeping the jacket's weight down; chin guard protects skin from zipper abrasion. Trim, watertight pit zippers offer quick venting options. Gasket Dry Cuffs enhance protection in wet conditions; cuffs have a low-profile closure and pleated gusset. Embedded cordlocks in the hood and hem allow quick adjustment without opening the jacket. Zip handwarmer pockets are positioned for easy access with harnesses and pack straps; includes a small internal zippered chest pocket. Low-bulk, flat-pleated front stays close to the body while still allowing the pockets to expand without the need for bulky seams. Patagonia Super Alpine jacket is designed with a regular fit that allows airflow and evaporative cooling, and eases layering.","short_description":"The Patagonia Super Alpine jacket is a big-mountain jacket for alpine climbing or ski mountaineering in the worst possible conditions.
