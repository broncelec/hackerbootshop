{"sku":"846115","manufacturer_id":"32920300","brand_name":"Salomon","product_name":" Salomon Advanced Skin S-Lab 5 Set Hydration Pack","long_description":"The formfitting Salomon Advanced Skin S-Lab 5 Set hydration pack is built for intense trail running. Includes a 50 fl. oz. (1.5 liter) Hydrapak(R) hydration reservoir so you can quickly satisfy your thirst on long runs; reservoir is phthalate free, PVC free and BPA free. Drink tube routes under your right arm and the bite valve is held in place for easy access while you're running; on/off switch on the bite valve prevents leaks. SensiFit construction uses stretchy fabrics to allow the pack to conform to your body for a good fit and great stability while you're on the go. 2 pockets on the shoulder straps hold water bottles (not included) within easy reach; removable zippered pocket on the left shoulder strap keeps energy gels and bars handy. 2 zippered side pockets keep additional food and other must-have items within easy reach; stretchy pocket on the right shoulder strap holds your cell phone close by. Use the load lifter cords to stabilize the weight on your back; tightening the straps puts pressure on the hydration reservoir to improve water flow. Dual sternum straps keep the pack secure without applying pressure to your chest. 3D mesh on the back panel helps move moisture away from your back to keep you comfortable on the trail. Large opening on top of the hydration reservoir makes it easy to fill; flip the reservoir inside out for easy cleaning. Quick-disconnect valve lets you remove the drink tube when you want to clean the reservoir. Insulated drink tube and a removable insulated sleeve for the reservoir help keep your beverage cool on hot days. Reflective hits increase visibility in low light. The Salomon Advanced Skin S-Lab 5 Set hydration pack comes with a safety blanket.","short_description":"The formfitting Salomon Advanced Skin S-Lab 5 Set hydration pack is built for intense trail running.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Backpacks","product_group":"Day Packs","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s411115.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l411115.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=411115&tt=df","retail_price":"195.00","sale_price":"119.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=411115\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m411115.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=846115&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8461150003":{"sku":"8461150003","vendor_sku":"32920300","upc":"080694525744","size":"XL","color":"ALUMINUM/RACING RED/BLACK","retail_price":"119.83","sale_price":"119.83"}}}
