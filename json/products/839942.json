Bi-component shell features specialized flex zones that complement the natural motion of your foot. Located between the first and second buckle, these zones feature soft plastic that boosts control, eases turns and enhances balance. Liners feature differing materials on the left and right; firm material helps you feel the terrain on inside of turn and soft material cushions recovery. Liners feature cushioning insoles and very warm, soft interiors to enhance comfort. Custom-moldable liners mold to ankles and forefeet to increase heel hold. Toe boxes reduce hot spots and increase comfort with 4-way stretch. 35mm powerstraps act as a fifth buckle. Grip plates use dual-density material to increase traction on slippery terrain. Flex index of 90 offers the comfortable performance preferred by intermediate skiers. The Atomic Hawx 90 ski boots feature 100mm footbeds to provide a good mix of comfort and performance.","short_description":"Focused on fun, the Atomic Hawx 90 ski boots carve fast turns and leave your feet with enough comfort at the end of the day to truly enjoy the apres-ski festivities.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Downhill Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382459.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382459.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382459&tt=df","retail_price":"399.00","sale_price":"322.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382459\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382459.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=839942&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8399420001":{"sku":"8399420001","vendor_sku":"AE5006060265","upc":"884397649642","size":"Mondo 26.5","color":"RED TRANSPARENT/BLACK","retail_price":"322.93","sale_price":"322.93"},"8399420002":{"sku":"8399420002","vendor_sku":"AE5006060275","upc":"884397649666","size":"Mondo 27.5","color":"RED TRANSPARENT/BLACK","retail_price":"322.93","sale_price":"322.93"},"8399420003":{"sku":"8399420003","vendor_sku":"AE5006060285","upc":"884397649680","size":"Mondo 28.5","color":"RED TRANSPARENT/BLACK","retail_price":"322.93","sale_price":"322.93"},"8399420004":{"sku":"8399420004","vendor_sku":"AE5006060295","upc":"884397649703","size":"Mondo 29.5","color":"RED TRANSPARENT/BLACK","retail_price":"322.93","sale_price":"322.93"}}}
