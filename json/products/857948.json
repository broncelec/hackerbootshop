{"sku":"857948","manufacturer_id":"VN-0UEQY38","brand_name":"Vans","product_name":"Vans Revere Snowboard Boots - 2013/2014","long_description":"The Vans Revere Snowboard boots feature custom-moldable liners and Vans Hybrid Boa lacing for a dialed fit that's perfect for your all-mountain shred sessions. Vans Hybrid Boa lacing offers the best of both worlds: it combines traditional laces with a Boa closure that focuses primarily on the critical instep area of the boots. Custom Boa dials celebrate the partnership between Vans and Boa, and feature a diamond texture and sidestripe detailing. Each boot has two RECCO(R) reflectors that enhance radio signals from search-and-rescue RECCO detectors for quicker location in an avalanche. QuadFit X thermal liners feature asymmetric X-Cage inserts that lock your heels in place; low-volume soles help you feel connected to the board. Liners can be custom-molded at your local REI store for a personalized fit. Cuffs flex easily for enhanced board control when carving; wrap-around design offers a secure closure around your ankles and calves. Dual instep flex zones allow a forgiving medial flex and natural articulation while maintaining lateral support. Molded EVA footbeds feature integrated arch support and dual-density metatarsal and heel impact-relief pads. Lightweight, cushioned rubber outsoles offer maximum traction in wet and slippery conditions; skate-style silhouette offers a low-profile fit.","short_description":"The Vans Revere Snowboard boots feature custom-moldable liners and Vans Hybrid Boa lacing for a dialed fit that's perfect for your all-mountain shred sessions.","category":"Snowboarding","subcategory":"Snowboard Boots","product_group":"Men's Snowboard Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s383115.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l383115.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=383115&tt=df","retail_price":"259.95","sale_price":"153.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=383115\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m383115.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=857948&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8579480001":{"sku":"8579480001","vendor_sku":"VN-0UEQY38","upc":"887682051656","size":"9","color":"GRAY/BLACK","retail_price":"153.83","sale_price":"153.83"},"8579480002":{"sku":"8579480002","vendor_sku":"VN-0UEQY38","upc":"887682051649","size":"9.5","color":"GRAY/BLACK","retail_price":"153.83","sale_price":"153.83"},"8579480003":{"sku":"8579480003","vendor_sku":"VN-0UEQY38","upc":"887682051632","size":"10","color":"GRAY/BLACK","retail_price":"153.83","sale_price":"153.83"},"8579480004":{"sku":"8579480004","vendor_sku":"VN-0UEQY38","upc":"887682051526","size":"10.5","color":"GRAY/BLACK","retail_price":"153.83","sale_price":"153.83"},"8579480005":{"sku":"8579480005","vendor_sku":"VN-0UEQY38","upc":"887682051533","size":"11","color":"GRAY/BLACK","retail_price":"153.83","sale_price":"153.83"},"8579480006":{"sku":"8579480006","vendor_sku":"VN-0UEQY38","upc":"887682051557","size":"12","color":"GRAY/BLACK","retail_price":"153.83","sale_price":"153.83"},"8579480007":{"sku":"8579480007","vendor_sku":"VN-0UEQY38","upc":"887682051564","size":"13","color":"GRAY/BLACK","retail_price":"153.83","sale_price":"153.83"}},"categories":["snow","snowboard-boots","mens-snowboard-boots"]}
