{"sku":"858570","manufacturer_id":"10621100611","brand_name":"Burton","product_name":" Burton Emerald Snowboard Boots - Women's - 2013/2014","long_description":"All-mountain slayers unite! The women's Burton Emerald snowboard boots offer mid-range support, slipperlike comfort and the simplicity and ease of a lightning fast lacing system. True Fit(TM) design considers every element, from liners to lace guides, and delivers the best fitting, most comfortable snowboard boots ever. Imprint(TM) 2 EVA liners wrap your feet in comfort; they'll conform to your feet after a few days of riding or you can custom mold them at your local shop. Liners feature long-lasting polyurethane energy panels and Quick Fit(TM) integrated lacing harness for easier-than-ever entry and exit. Liners feature hot pockets-small neoprene sleeves sized for disposable foot warmers (includes one pair). Strategically placed backstays ensure a consistent flex throughout boot life; even after being flexed repeatedly, they return and maintain their original position. Medium-flex, thin-profile 3D-molded tongues wrap the forefeet for seamless flex, and reduce performance-robbing shell/liner stack-up. Streamlined Speed Zone(TM) shell lacing system lets you fine-tune the fit quickly and easily; customize the upper and lower zones in a matter of seconds. Outsoles give you low-profile stability with an airbag design and EVA midsoles to protect your feet from repeated drops and landings.","short_description":"All-mountain slayers unite!
