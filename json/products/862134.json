{"sku":"862134","manufacturer_id":"CM2419MD01","brand_name":"Cannondale","product_name":" Cannondale F29 Alloy 5 Bike - 2014","long_description":"A speedy steed for serious riders, the Cannondale F29 Alloy 5 hardtail mountain bike takes on cross-country trails with fast-rolling 29 in. wheels, a cushy Lefty fork and Shimano components. F29 aluminum frame features a geometry that's designed to offer race-inspired, nimble handling; 1.5 in. headtube improves strength, stiffness and handling. Rear stays are shaped to help smooth out trail chatter and enhance rolling speed, acceleration and handling. Lefty 29er fork with Push-Button Rebound (PBR) offers 90mm of smooth, responsive travel and precise handling; easy-access lockout and rebound controls are glove-friendly. Large BB30 bottom bracket design increases stiffness for improved power-transfer. Shimano SLX shifters, SLX Shadow Plus rear derailleur and Deore front derailleur quickly guide the chain through the 20 gears of the 2x10 drivetrain. Shimano Deore hydraulic disc brakes provide great feel and progressive, powerful braking, thanks in part to the pairing of a 180mm rotor up front and a 160mm rotor in the back. Stan's ZTR Rapid rims and fast-rolling, corner-hungry Schwalbe Racing Ralph Perfomance tires are tubeless-ready for an easy upgrade. Pedals sold separately. Specs on the Cannondale F29 Alloy 5 hardtail mountain bike are subject to change.","short_description":"A speedy steed for serious riders, the Cannondale F29 Alloy 5 hardtail mountain bike takes on cross-country trails with fast-rolling 29 in. wheels, a cushy Lefty fork and Shimano components.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bikes","product_group":"Mountain Bikes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s374863.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l374863.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=374863&tt=df","retail_price":"2199.00","sale_price":"2199.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=374863\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m374863.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=862134&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8621340001":{"sku":"8621340001","vendor_sku":"CM2419XL01","upc":"884603519080","size":"S","color":"MARINER BLUE GLOSS","retail_price":"2199.00","sale_price":"2199.00"},"8621340002":{"sku":"8621340002","vendor_sku":"CM2419LG01","upc":"884603519097","size":"M","color":"MARINER BLUE GLOSS","retail_price":"2199.00","sale_price":"2199.00"},"8621340003":{"sku":"8621340003","vendor_sku":"CM2419MD01","upc":"884603519103","size":"L","color":"MARINER BLUE GLOSS","retail_price":"2199.00","sale_price":"2199.00"},"8621340004":{"sku":"8621340004","vendor_sku":"CM2419SM01","upc":"884603519110","size":"XL","color":"MARINER BLUE GLOSS","retail_price":"2199.00","sale_price":"2199.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bikes","mountain-bikes"]}
