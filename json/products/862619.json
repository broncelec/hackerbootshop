{"sku":"862619","manufacturer_id":"T-2200","brand_name":"Kinetic","product_name":" Kinetic Road Machine 2.0 Bike Trainer","long_description":"Designed to keep up with serious indoor training, the Kinetic Road Machine 2.0 Bike Trainer is much quieter than magnetic trainers thanks to its fluid, progressive resistance. Quiet, smooth, progressive resistance replicates the feel of an outdoor ride: as you pedal faster, the resistance increases. The key is the leak-proof fluid mechanism. Rubberized, grippy knobs and sturdy design offer excellent stability. Trainer folds in half for easy transport and off-season storage. The Kinetic Road Machine 2.0 Bike Trainer features a larger-than-average roller to reduce tire wear. Compatible with all bikes with 22 - 29 in. diameter wheels and up to 29 x 2.4 in. tires. Range of resistance from 5 - 3,000 watts; fully assembled.","short_description":"Designed to keep up with serious indoor training, the Kinetic Road Machine 2.0 Bike Trainer is much quieter than magnetic trainers thanks to its fluid, progressive resistance.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Accessories","product_group":"Bike Trainers","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s379579.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l379579.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=379579&tt=df","retail_price":"349.00","sale_price":"349.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=379579\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m379579.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=862619&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8626190001":{"sku":"8626190001","vendor_sku":"T-2200","upc":"851061001204","color":"GREEN","retail_price":"349.00","sale_price":"349.00"}}}
