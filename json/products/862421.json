{"sku":"862421","manufacturer_id":"16392","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":" REI Quarter Dome 1 Tent","long_description":"The REI Quarter Dome 1 Tent uses new ultralight materials and a unique design to create a lightweight 1-person, 3-season backpacking tent that's roomy, well ventilated and strong. Our new 15-denier ripstop nylon in the tent and fly minimizes weight, yet retains strength; floor uses a lightweight yet robust 30-denier ripstop nylon. REI-exclusive tension-truss architecture creates stable vertical sidewalls and generous headroom while minimizing pole weight. Pole angles and asymmetrical tent shape also enhance living space, allowing you to sit up comfortably. Vestibule provides covered storage; doors on fly and tent are aligned for easy entry and exit. Hubbed pole assembly simplifies setup. A large zippered roof vent helps control condensation. Pockets and hang loops help organize the interior. The REI Quarter Dome 1 Tent comes with a stuff sack, stakes, guylines and tighteners, as well as a pole-repair tube, a pole bag and a stake bag. Fly/footprint minimalist pitch option lets you leave the tent at home and use the fly, poles and footprint (sold separately) as a lightweight shelter. The REI Quarter Dome 1 Footprint is sold separately.","short_description":"The REI Quarter Dome 1 Tent uses new ultralight materials and a unique design to create a lightweight 1-person, 3-season backpacking tent that's roomy, well ventilated and strong.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Tents","product_group":"Backpacking Tents","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s424003.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l424003.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=424003&tt=df","retail_price":"219.00","sale_price":"219.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=424003\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m424003.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=862421&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8624210001":{"sku":"8624210001","vendor_sku":"16392","upc":"486242100010","color":"ZINC/ORANGE SPICE","retail_price":"219.00","sale_price":"219.00"}}}
