{"sku":"850450","manufacturer_id":"BF116MCITYYBK","brand_name":"Badfish","product_name":" Badfish MCIT Inflatable Stand Up Paddleboard - 11' 6\"","long_description":"Pushing the envelope as a tough, maneuverable and high-floating inflatable stand up paddleboard, the adventure-ready Badfish 11 ft. 6 in. MCIT is right at home in moving currents and swift waters. Spanning the interior of the inflatable like an iron spider's web, thousands of drop-stitch fibers allow a very high, almost rock-hard, inflation pressure. High air pressure creates a rigid hull without the use of frame parts, and unlike hard boards, there's no need to worry about dings or chipped surfaces. Performance is suited to whitewater, flatwater and surf. PVC-coated, high-denier polyester stands up to heavy use. 11 ft. 6 in. length and 275 lb. weight capacity makes the Badfish a great choice for larger paddlers. 35 in. width offers stability that's extremely friendly to beginners. MCIT stands for Multi Chamber Inflatable Technology; the designers of this board incorporated special features to enhance performance in roily, unpredictable currents. A unique feature in the world of inflatable SUPs, tapered rails enhance stability and make the board highly maneuverable. Deck sits below the rail height to make the MCIT stand up paddleboard very stable in unpredictable currents. Stiffening system increases side-to-side response, and tough cone in the bow increases impact resistance. Deck pad reduces foot fatigue and provides a soft surface when kneeling on board. Center fin with 2 side-bite fins promotes stability; 7 in. center fin is removable if you want to paddle in shallow water. Forward deck bungee secures day-tripping accessories. The Badfish MCIT paddleboard packs into a durable backpack and includes a high-pressure, 2-way air pump with gauge, valve adaptors and repair kit.","short_description":"Pushing the envelope as a tough, maneuverable and high-floating inflatable stand up paddleboard, the adventure-ready Badfish 11 ft. 6 in.
