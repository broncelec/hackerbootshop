{"sku":"839523","brand_name":"Burton","product_name":"Burton Stiletto Snowboard Bindings - Women's - 2012/2013","long_description":"Strap in and show off. The Burton Stiletto snowboard bindings let you charge harder, turn quicker and boost larger. They're a blast. Women-specific True Fit(TM) Design creates boots and bindings specifically for the way a woman rides, ensuring complete control, total power and ultimate fun. Ergonomically-canted, cored highbacks eliminate hardware to save weight; forward lean and highback rotation adjust independently of each other for a precise fit. Highbacks rotate side to side to follow the natural contours of your calves, optimizing power and comfort; forward lean adjusts quickly and easily without a tool. Highbacks feature over-the-top padding for extra cushioning that won't bite your calf. Lush ankle straps and premium toe straps lock you into the bindings; precurved and padded, they feature telescoping and multilocation adjustability. Stilletto bindings feature smooth-gliding buckles that close and release quickly, are easy to grab and provide many seasons of premium ratcheting power. Tool-free telescoping straps adjust in seconds. Single-component, lightweight-yet-tough, polycarbonate baseplates with EVA toe and heel pads create moderate flex and consistent response for a versatile ride on all terrain. FullBED cushioning system offers a full-coverage, cushioned platform that maximizes comfort and minimizes fatigue.","short_description":"Strap in and show off.
