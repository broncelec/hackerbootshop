{"sku":"863018","manufacturer_id":"9903","brand_name":"Cycleops","product_name":"CycleOps Magneto Bike Trainer - 2014","long_description":"The CycleOps Magneto bike trainer offers a quiet, indoor training option you can use no matter what the weather is like outside. It offers progressive resistance suited to enthusiast riders. Updated frame works with all standard wheels and now works with 29er mountain bike wheels (fits most treads to 2.25 in.). No manual adjustments needed; simply shift gears as you would when riding outside to increase or decrease the resistance, and the faster you pedal the harder it gets. With a quick load cam lever, you simply adjust the resistance once and then lock it into place so there is no guessing each time you put your bike on the trainer. With a smooth, quiet ride, locking bolt ring and heavy-duty steel construction, you're ready to sprint, spin and climb with confidence. The Cyclops Magneto bike trainer features adjustable foot pads, a quick release handle, self-cooling mechanism and folding legs for storage.","short_description":"The CycleOps Magneto bike trainer offers a quiet, indoor training option you can use no matter what the weather is like outside.
