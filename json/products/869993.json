{"sku":"869993","manufacturer_id":"00.1918.037.010","brand_name":"Zipp","product_name":"Zipp 303 Firecrest Carbon Clincher Disc Wheel - Rear","long_description":"A 900g carbon wheel built for speed, the rear Zipp 303 Firecrest Carbon Clincher Disc Wheel offers 11-speed compatibility and a versatile clincher design that works with disc brakes. Ultralight carbon rim uses Firecrest(R) shaping to optimize the aerodynamic profile of both the front and back halves of the wheel. This rim shape also offers incredible crosswind stability, performing closer to a box-section rim despite the 45mm deep profile; dimpled surface dramatically reduces drag. Wider rim profile increases side-to-side stiffness for responsive sprinting and cornering; also offers great control, comfort, and strength. Zipp 188 hub uses Swiss-made cartridge bearings with extremely smooth-rolling grade 10 steel balls. Shimano/SRAM freehub body is compatible with 11-speed cassettes; works with 10-speed cassettes with optional shim (shim not included). 24 spokes are laced radially on the drive-side and crossed on the non-drive-side onto the 188 hub. Oversize 17mm diameter axle delivers significant stiffness for minimal deflection and precise response to input; axle spacing is 135mm. The rear Zipp 303 Firecrest Carbon Clincher Disc Wheel has a maximum tire pressure of 125 psi (8.62 bar). Please note: this wheel is clincher-compatible only and comes with a quick-release skewer, rim tape, valve extender and Tangente butyl tube. Zipp recommends a maximum weight of 250 lbs. (113kg) including rider, bike and gear.","short_description":"A 900g carbon wheel built for speed, the rear Zipp 303 Firecrest Carbon Clincher Disc Wheel offers 11-speed compatibility and a versatile clincher design that works with disc brakes.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Components","product_group":"Bike Tires, Tubes And Wheels","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s458059.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l458059.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=458059&tt=df","retail_price":"1553.00","sale_price":"1553.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=458059\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m458059.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=869993&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8699930001":{"sku":"8699930001","vendor_sku":"00.1918.037.010","upc":"710845727696","size":"700C","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"1553.00","sale_price":"1553.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-components","bike-tires-tubes-and-wheels"]}
