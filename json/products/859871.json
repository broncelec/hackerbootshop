{"sku":"859871","manufacturer_id":"RI2WA86","brand_name":"Rossignol","product_name":"Rossignol BC X6 75mm Cross-Country Ski Boots","long_description":"The Rossignol BC X6 75mm backcountry touring boots provide durability and warmth for exploring off the beaten path with warm Thinsulate(R) linings, durable lace covers and gaiters and rugged soles. Quick-cinch external cuff gaiters and ultra-durable Cordura(R) nylon lace covers ensure the spindrift stays out so your feet stay dry and warm. Thinsulate(TM) polyester/thermo-moldable foam insulation supplies non-bulky warmth and comfort even when damp; after a few days of skiing the foam molds to your feet. Nylon shanks in the midsoles provide increased support, stability and durability, and help prevent foot fatigue; dual-density heel counters support and stabilize heels. Medial and lateral webbing reinforcements integrated into the boots' lacing system securely wrap the feet and lock down heels and insteps, maximizing support and control. Rossignol BC X6 ski boots have rugged, non-slip 75mm soles that fit 3-pin backcountry bindings.","short_description":"The Rossignol BC X6 75mm backcountry touring boots provide durability and warmth for exploring off the beaten path with warm Thinsulate(R) linings, durable lace covers and gaiters and rugged soles.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Cross-Country Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s453559.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l453559.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=453559&tt=df","retail_price":"139.95","sale_price":"139.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=453559\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m453559.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859871&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8598710005":{"sku":"8598710005","vendor_sku":"RI2WA86","size":"42 EU","color":"BLACK/ORANGE","retail_price":"139.95","sale_price":"139.95"},"8598710006":{"sku":"8598710006","vendor_sku":"RI2WA86","size":"43 EU","color":"BLACK/ORANGE","retail_price":"139.95","sale_price":"139.95"},"8598710007":{"sku":"8598710007","vendor_sku":"RI2WA86","size":"44 EU","color":"BLACK/ORANGE","retail_price":"139.95","sale_price":"139.95"},"8598710008":{"sku":"8598710008","vendor_sku":"RI2WA86","size":"45 EU","color":"BLACK/ORANGE","retail_price":"139.95","sale_price":"139.95"}},"categories":["snow","ski-boots","crosscountry-ski-boots"]}
