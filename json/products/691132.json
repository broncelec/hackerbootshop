{"sku":"691132","manufacturer_id":"SM4BLCT","brand_name":"Fisher Space Pen","product_name":" Fisher Space Pen Military Pen","long_description":"Made especially for the U.S. armed forces, this rugged pen can write nearly anywhere, on nearly anything. Replaceable pressurized ink cartridge continuously feeds ink to the tungsten carbide ball, allowing pen to write at any angle--even upside down. Thixotropic ink writes smoothly and dependably on most surfaces, even under water, on photographs, in freezing cold, extreme heat and in space! Stainless steel, precision-machined socket prevents leaks and oozing yet delivers uniform ink flow. Revolving ball liquefies the ink so that it writes more smoothly, more dependably and longer than most pens. Medium point, black ink.","short_description":"Made especially for the U.S. armed forces, this rugged pen can write nearly anywhere, on nearly anything.","category":"Lifestyle And Gifts","subcategory":"Journals And Pens","product_group":"Pens","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s430083.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l430083.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=430083&tt=df","retail_price":"16.00","sale_price":"16.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=430083\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m430083.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=691132&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"6911320003":{"sku":"6911320003","vendor_sku":"SM4BLCT","upc":"747609820249","color":"MATTE BLUE","retail_price":"16.00","sale_price":"16.00"},"6911320015":{"sku":"6911320015","vendor_sku":"SM4B","upc":"747609542417","color":"BLACK MATTE","retail_price":"12.00","sale_price":"12.00"}},"categories":["gifts","journals-and-pens","pens"]}
