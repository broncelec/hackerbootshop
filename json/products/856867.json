{"sku":"856867","manufacturer_id":"3211045","brand_name":"Gnu","product_name":" GNU Carbon Credit Series BTX Snowboard - 2013/2014","long_description":"If you're a progressing freestyle rider looking to take the skills to the next level, pick the GNU Carbon Credit Series BTX snowboard. It's for riding the park, floating through pow and ripping turns. Banana Technology puts rocker between your feet; control is balanced in the center, and the catch-free ends float and climb through tight transitions. Magne-Traction improves edge grip by adding seven contact points along the running length of the board, resulting in amazing control whether riding ice or pow. Twin shape (tip and tail are equal in length and width) and centered sidecut ride equally well in both directions, great for all-mountain freestyle riding. Lightweight aspen wood core offers an even flex and low spin weight; fiberglass increases board stiffness and pop. Impact-resistant end-grain internal sidewalls; UHMW sidewalls stand up to wear and tear; steel edges; extruded base is fast and low maintenance. .","short_description":"If you're a progressing freestyle rider looking to take the skills to the next level, pick the GNU Carbon Credit Series BTX snowboard.
