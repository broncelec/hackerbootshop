{"sku":"758707","manufacturer_id":"OP3-12X20","brand_name":"Loksak","product_name":"LOKSAK OPSak Odor-Proof Barrier Bags - 20 x 12.5","long_description":"Certified and field tested to be odor-, humidity-, vapor- and leak-proof, these LOKSAK bags ensure secure and undisturbed closure. Great for preventing campsite animal intrusions because foods stored inside cannot be detected through the bags. Made with a patented, high-tenacity polymer, bags are flexible and shatterproof. Bags meet FDA and USDA specifications for food contact and can even hold boiling water or be used as food freezer bags. Use to store food, rehydrate freeze-dried meals or stow toiletries. Bags can also be used to safely transport human waste. Easy-to-use closures are as simple as using a typical zip-closure type bag, but provide water-tight protection. Transparent material lets you easily view contents. Package includes three 20 x 12.5-inch bags; each bag weighs less than an ounce. Waterproof to 200 feet.","short_description":"Certified and field tested to be odor-, humidity-, vapor- and leak-proof, these LOKSAK bags ensure secure and undisturbed closure.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Camp Kitchen","product_group":"Coolers","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s415147.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l415147.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=415147&tt=df","retail_price":"13.50","sale_price":"13.50","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=415147\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m415147.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=758707&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7587070017":{"sku":"7587070017","vendor_sku":"OP3-12X20","upc":"757791312200","color":"CLEAR","retail_price":"13.50","sale_price":"13.50"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","camp-kitchen","coolers"]}
