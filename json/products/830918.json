{"sku":"830918","manufacturer_id":"M58D 17","brand_name":"Petzl","product_name":" Petzl Ange Finesse Quickdraw Set","long_description":"Climb without hesitation with the Petzl Ange Finesse quickdraws. They're light, strong and easy to clip to help you cruise up sport climbs. Available in 2 lengths, the 10cm quickraw includes 2 ultralight Ange S carabiners and the 17cm quickdraw includes 1 ultralight Ange S 'biner and 1 standard-size Ange L 'biner. Ange carabiners feature the MonoFil Keylock wiregate system that blends the strength and fluidity of a standard spring gate with the lightness of a wiregate. Straight keylock nose lets you clip and unclip slings, bolt hangers, nuts and cams without snagging; hole in the nose allows ice, snow and dirt to be cleared out. Surfaces that come into contact with the climbing rope are wider than other parts of the carabiner for smooth passage of the rope and reduced wear on the 'biner. Ange S carabiner weighs only 28g and the Ange L weighs 34g. Carabiners are connected with either a 10cm or 17cm Finesse sewn sling that is made from Dyneema with nylon stitching for high strength and low weight. String S webbing protection at the bottom of the sling protects against abrasion while also keeping the rope-end carabiner properly positioned. The Petzl Ange Finesse quickdraw set is available in 10cm or 17cm lengths.","short_description":"Climb without hesitation with the Petzl Ange Finesse quickdraws.
