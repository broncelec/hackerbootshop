{"sku":"858561","manufacturer_id":"10436100019","brand_name":"Burton","product_name":" Burton Moto Snowboard Boots - 2013/2014","long_description":"Burton Moto snowboard boots bring you cushioned outsoles, easy lacing and soft-flexing performance for lasting comfort all over the mountain. No wonder they are the best-selling boots year after year! Shrinkage(TM) technology reduces boot's overall footprint by 1 full size, minimizing boot overhang, bulk and weight. Soft-flexing, slim 3D-molded tongues wrap your forefeet in comfort, offer a seamless flex and reduce performance-robbing shell/liner stack-up. Streamlined Speed Zone(TM) shell lacing lets you fine-tune the upper and lower zones in seconds; this system offers powerful rebound, wrap and response with minimal effort. To make entry and exit easy, Burton has added pull loop on the tongue as well as a lace pull tab that releases both the upper and lower zones simultaneously. Imprint(TM) 1 EVA liners with quick-fit harnesses and lace locks secure feet; lightweight power panels surround calves and ankles with supportive comfort. Snowproof internal gussets on boot tongues completely seal lower boot zones to keep feet warm and dry. Durable 2-part outsoles feature EVA cushion in heels and rubber ice spikes for incredible traction on slippery surfaces.","short_description":"Burton Moto snowboard boots bring you cushioned outsoles, easy lacing and soft-flexing performance for lasting comfort all over the mountain.
