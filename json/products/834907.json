Smooth grain leather exteriors have Gore-Tex(R) waterproof, breathable inserts to keep your hands warm and dry on winter adventures. Leather has a Durable Water Repellent finish that causes water to bead up and roll off. DuPont(TM) ComforMax(TM) Premium polyester insulation fends of cold temperatures without adding bulkiness. Brushed microfiber lining is comfortable next to skin, and it wicks moisture to keep your hands dry. Grippy leather palms help you hold onto your ski poles. Zippered pockets on the backs of the gloves are sized to hold hand warmer packets (sold separately); pockets double as vents to let warm air out. Cinch the gauntlets closed to keep snow and cold air out of the Swix Leather Dog gloves. Slip your hands through the leashes so you won't lose a glove while skiing.","short_description":"Enjoy the ski slopes with warm hands thanks to the Swix Leather Dog gloves.","category":"Men's Clothing","subcategory":"Men's Clothing Accessories","product_group":"Men's Gloves And Mittens","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s400051.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l400051.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=400051&tt=df","retail_price":"150.00","sale_price":"104.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=400051\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m400051.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=834907&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8349070001":{"sku":"8349070001","vendor_sku":"H1341","size":"S","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"104.93","sale_price":"104.93"}}}
