{"sku":"867519","manufacturer_id":"SWLBLK","brand_name":"Astral","product_name":"Astral Sea Wolf PFD - Men's","long_description":"The Sea Wolf PFD from Astral combines storage space, lightweight construction and a fit that's beyond the ordinary for expedition-minded paddlers looking for versatility. You'll paddle more easily thanks to separate foam panels that move freely with your paddling motion. Outer ripstop shell provides superior abrasion resistance and durability. They're designed to work like tectonic plates, with an outer panel moving freely while the inner panel remains anchored in place. Large clamshell front pocket features plenty of space and additional organization pocket; 2 fleece side pockets offer a cozy place to warm up hands. 7 in. elastic back band enhances comfort during long paddles; front adjustment straps dial in the torso length. Attachment point on back of the Astral Sea Wolf PFD works with a strobe light (not included), and reflective hits placed high on the vest increase visibility. Side buckles make it easy to enter PFD from the side if you are wearing paddling layers; compatible with a quick-release belt (not included).","short_description":"The Sea Wolf PFD from Astral combines storage space, lightweight construction and a fit that's beyond the ordinary for expedition-minded paddlers looking for versatility.","category":"Paddling","subcategory":"Pfds","product_group":"Men's Pfds","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s463795.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l463795.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=463795&tt=df","keywords":"kayaking","retail_price":"185.95","sale_price":"185.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=463795\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m463795.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=867519&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8675190001":{"sku":"8675190001","vendor_sku":"SWSBLK","upc":"818040013368","size":"S/M","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"185.95","sale_price":"185.95"},"8675190002":{"sku":"8675190002","vendor_sku":"SWMBLK","upc":"818040013382","size":"M/L","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"185.95","sale_price":"185.95"},"8675190003":{"sku":"8675190003","vendor_sku":"SWLBLK","upc":"818040013405","size":"L/XL","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"185.95","sale_price":"185.95"},"8675190005":{"sku":"8675190005","vendor_sku":"SWMYEL","upc":"818040013399","size":"M/L","color":"YELLOW","retail_price":"185.95","sale_price":"185.95"},"8675190006":{"sku":"8675190006","vendor_sku":"SWLYEL","upc":"818040013412","size":"L/XL","color":"YELLOW","retail_price":"185.95","sale_price":"185.95"}},"categories":["paddling","pfds","mens-pfds"]}
