{"sku":"867315","manufacturer_id":"02-14-2320","brand_name":"Diamondback","product_name":" Diamondback Overdrive Sport 29er Bike - 2014","long_description":"A fast-rolling 29er at a great value, the Diamondback Overdrive Sport 29er mountain bike takes on singletrack with its tough butted frame, Shimano drivetrain and 100mm shock-absorbent fork. Compared to smaller tires, 29er wheels roll over obstacles easier and faster with more momentum, a decreased angle of attack and more tire contact for better traction. SR Suntour XCR-LO 29 suspension fork delivers 100mm of travel to help smooth out rough trails. Butted aluminum frame features formed top and down tubes for excellent power transfer, durability and handling performance; machined head tube improves strength. Shimano shifters and derailleurs offer reliable shifts through the 24 gear combinations as you pedal your way up, down and across your favorite trails. Shimano hydraulic disc brakes employ a 180mm rotor up front and a 160mm rotor in back to facilitate powerful, responsive braking. Weinmann double-walled rims are wrapped with WTB Wolverine Comp tires, which boast a fast-rolling center tread and aggressive shoulder tread for confident cornering. Specs on the Diamondback Overdrive Sport 29er hardtail mountain bike are subject to change.","short_description":"A fast-rolling 29er at a great value, the Diamondback Overdrive Sport 29er mountain bike takes on singletrack with its tough butted frame, Shimano drivetrain and 100mm shock-absorbent fork.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bikes","product_group":"Mountain Bikes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s374995.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l374995.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=374995&tt=df","retail_price":"699.00","sale_price":"699.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=374995\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m374995.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=867315&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8673150002":{"sku":"8673150002","vendor_sku":"02-14-2321","upc":"791964419938","size":"M","color":"GLOSS BLUE","retail_price":"699.00","sale_price":"699.00"},"8673150003":{"sku":"8673150003","vendor_sku":"02-14-2322","upc":"791964420200","size":"L","color":"GLOSS BLUE","retail_price":"699.00","sale_price":"699.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bikes","mountain-bikes"]}
