{"sku":"861609","manufacturer_id":"00006","brand_name":"Kurgo","product_name":" Kurgo Backseat Barrier","long_description":"The sturdy, stylish Kurgo Backseat Barrier attaches to the back of your front seats, creating a soft wall that keeps Fido in the back and prevents driver distraction. Mesh frame keeps your dog from leaping-or launching during sudden braking-into the front seat. Fido can still see out the front and you can still reach back to give your dog a scratch on the head. Stays in place without getting in the way when passengers are in the back seat; pocket holds a water bottle or leash. Included straps and metal hardware let you install the Kurgo Backseat Barrier into most cars, from compact to SUV; does not accommodate 2-door cars or minivans.","short_description":"The sturdy, stylish Kurgo Backseat Barrier attaches to the back of your front seats, creating a soft wall that keeps Fido in the back and prevents driver distraction.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Dog Gear","product_group":"Dog Beds And Carriers","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s417475.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l417475.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=417475&tt=df","retail_price":"45.00","sale_price":"45.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=417475\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m417475.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=861609&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8616090001":{"sku":"8616090001","vendor_sku":"00006","upc":"896622000067","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"45.00","sale_price":"45.00"}}}
