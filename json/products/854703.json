{"sku":"854703","manufacturer_id":"31131","brand_name":"Patagonia","product_name":"Patagonia Snowbelle Insulated Pants - Women's Short","long_description":"On the slopes or in the snow fort, women's Patagonia Insulated Snowbelle short snow pants deliver waterproof protection and cozy insulation to keep you warm and dry no matter how you play in the snow. Rugged, 2-layer polyester shell is backed with a waterproof, breathable laminate to deliver all-weather protection, from late spring slush to snorkel-deep pow. Durable Water Repellent finish causes water to bead up and roll off, fending off melting snow to help keep you dry. 60g of synthetic insulation-90% of which is recycled content-provides insulating warmth, even if it gets damp; plus, it compresses easily for compact stowing. Embedded RECCO(R) reflector enhances radio signals from search-and-rescue RECCO detectors, helping speed up the search for a buried avalanche victim. Polyester lining helps move sweat away from your body and glides smoothly over base layers; thigh vents let you release excess body heat for comfort. Brushed lining on waistband wicks sweat and provides against-the-skin comfort; zip-fly, 2-snap closure and adjustable waistband tabs provide a personalized fit. Snow gaiters securely wrap around boots with gripper elastic to keep snow from entering pants; scuff guards protect cuffs from abrasion and sharp edges. Zippered handwarmer pockets. Articulated knees allow unrestricted movement for deep knee drops and radical aerials.","short_description":"On the slopes or in the snow fort, women's Patagonia Insulated Snowbelle short snow pants deliver waterproof protection and cozy insulation to keep you warm and dry no matter how you play in the snow.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Women's Ski Clothing","product_group":"Women's Ski Pants","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s338219.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l338219.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=338219&tt=df","keywords":"pant,snowpant,snow pants,hardshell pants,pants","retail_price":"199.00","sale_price":"199.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=338219\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m338219.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=854703&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8547030001":{"sku":"8547030001","vendor_sku":"31131","upc":"887187255382","size":"XS Short","color":"IKAT PURPLE","retail_price":"199.00","sale_price":"199.00"},"8547030002":{"sku":"8547030002","vendor_sku":"31131","upc":"887187255399","size":"S Short","color":"IKAT PURPLE","retail_price":"199.00","sale_price":"199.00"},"8547030003":{"sku":"8547030003","vendor_sku":"31131","upc":"887187255405","size":"M Short","color":"IKAT PURPLE","retail_price":"199.00","sale_price":"199.00"},"8547030004":{"sku":"8547030004","vendor_sku":"31131","upc":"887187255412","size":"L Short","color":"IKAT PURPLE","retail_price":"199.00","sale_price":"199.00"},"8547030006":{"sku":"8547030006","vendor_sku":"31131","upc":"887187255283","size":"XS Short","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"199.00","sale_price":"199.00"},"8547030007":{"sku":"8547030007","vendor_sku":"31131","upc":"887187255290","size":"S Short","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"199.00","sale_price":"199.00"},"8547030008":{"sku":"8547030008","vendor_sku":"31131","upc":"887187255306","size":"M Short","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"199.00","sale_price":"199.00"},"8547030009":{"sku":"8547030009","vendor_sku":"31131","upc":"887187255313","size":"L Short","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"199.00","sale_price":"199.00"}}}
