{"sku":"867426","manufacturer_id":"14W053090","brand_name":"Topo Athletic","product_name":" Topo Athletic W-MT Trail-Running Shoes - Women's","long_description":"The rugged women's Topo Athletic W-MT Trail-Running Shoes are built for trail running, light hiking and approaches to climbs. They combine a minimalist design with cushioning for use on rough trails. Mesh uppers with printed overlays allow your feet to breathe and stay cool; mesh linings help move moisture away from your feet to keep them dry. Anatomic closed toe boxes allow your toes to spread naturally. 2mm heel-to-toe drop encourages a natural midfoot or forefoot strike to promote forward momentum and reduce the impact of heel striking. Dual-density midsoles are 6mm thick up front and 8mm thick under the heels for good cushioning on rough trails. Crisscross Ghillie lacing system ensures a snug fit through the midfoot. Grippy rubber soles provide good traction on rocky trails. The Topo Athletic W-MT Trail-Running Shoes have a total stack height of 17mm at the forefoot and 19mm at the heel.","short_description":"The rugged women's Topo Athletic W-MT Trail-Running Shoes are built for trail running, light hiking and approaches to climbs.
