{"sku":"822419","manufacturer_id":"N57011","brand_name":"Fischer","product_name":"Fischer S-Bound 88 Backcountry Skis","long_description":"The lightweight Fischer S-Bound 88 skis let you carve turns and cover a lot of ground on your backcountry tours. Sidecut and a specially tuned camber keep the skis lively in soft snow. Fiberglass wood cores feature air channels that keep weight down while maintaining good strength and durability. Features 5/10 Nordic Rocker camber that gives the skis great turning characteristics and control in variable snow conditions. 5/10 Nordic Rocker indicates that when pressure is applied the ski tips lift 5mm and the location of the ski-to-snow contact point at the front of the skis moves back 10cm. Offtrack Crown waxless pattern on the bases provides good grip while you're touring in fresh snow. Full metal edges dig into hard snow and ice to optimize control on steep terrain. Universal stone grind on the bases of the Fischer S-Bound 88 skis provides good glide in all snow conditions.
