{"sku":"778798","manufacturer_id":"ICN7901116","brand_name":"Shimano","product_name":" Shimano Dura-Ace CN-7901 10-Speed Chain","long_description":"The no-compromise Dura-Ace CN-7901 chain, specifically designed to be used with Shimano 10-speed drivetrains, has new asymmetry that improves its contact with cogs. Newly designed outer and inner plates provide better contact with gear teeth for smoother shifting-even highly loaded shifting. New design decreases pedaling noise, smooths pedaling and creates less chance of chain drop. Hollow pins and perforated plates save weight. Improved pin fittings reduce chain flexing; you'll enjoy stable shifting performance and feel even when the chain is stretched. Not compatible with 9-speed systems.","short_description":"The no-compromise Dura-Ace CN-7901 chain, specifically designed to be used with Shimano 10-speed drivetrains, has new asymmetry that improves its contact with cogs.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Components","product_group":"Drivetrain Components","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s439903.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l439903.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=439903&tt=df","retail_price":"55.00","sale_price":"55.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=439903\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m439903.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=778798&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7787980015":{"sku":"7787980015","vendor_sku":"ICN7901116","upc":"689228272804","retail_price":"55.00","sale_price":"55.00"}}}
