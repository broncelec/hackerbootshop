{"sku":"840526","manufacturer_id":"325986","brand_name":"Salomon","product_name":" Salomon Quest 100 Ski Boots - Women's - 2012/2013","long_description":"When the tracked-out runs are all too familiar, and you know there's powder over the far ridge, the women's Salomon Quest 100 ski boots offer you the option of hiking for your turns. Specialized ski/hike mechanism frees the upper cuff from the lower part of the boot and offers enough movement to comfortably hike to untouched stashes. When you're ready to ski, the cuffs lock directly into the lower shell to maximize power transmission on the descent. Innovative V-shaped lower shell and magnesium backbone virtually eliminate flex when backbone is engaged. Waterproof fabric along the sides of the tongues helps keep feet dry, even when hiking in deep powder. Women-specific liners feature upper cuffs that are shaped around women's calf muscles, a wide forefoot area and low volume around the ankles. Comfortable liners feature a layer of custom-moldable foam that personalizes the fit around the ankle and shin. Moisture-wicking layers of mesh, foam and insulation in liners efficiently transfer chilling sweat away from feet. Liners disperse more moisture than standard liners, helping keep feet dry and warm. Closed-cell foam under the boot boards softens hard landings. Single canting sets cuffs to a different forward lean angles depending on how aggressively you ski. Rubber soles offer excellent traction on slippery surfaces. With a flex index of 100, Salomon Quest 100 ski boots provide a power transfer suitable for advanced skiers.","short_description":"When the tracked-out runs are all too familiar, and you know there's powder over the far ridge, the women's Salomon Quest 100 ski boots offer you the option of hiking for your turns.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Downhill Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382475.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382475.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382475&tt=df","retail_price":"499.95","sale_price":"399.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382475\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382475.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=840526&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8405260002":{"sku":"8405260002","vendor_sku":"325986","upc":"080694064816","size":"Mondo 23.5","color":"PURPLE TRANSLUCENT/WHITE","retail_price":"399.93","sale_price":"399.93"},"8405260003":{"sku":"8405260003","vendor_sku":"325986","upc":"080694064830","size":"Mondo 24.5","color":"PURPLE TRANSLUCENT/WHITE","retail_price":"399.93","sale_price":"399.93"},"8405260004":{"sku":"8405260004","vendor_sku":"325986","upc":"080694064854","size":"Mondo 25.5","color":"PURPLE TRANSLUCENT/WHITE","retail_price":"399.93","sale_price":"399.93"},"8405260005":{"sku":"8405260005","vendor_sku":"325986","upc":"080694064878","size":"Mondo 26.5","color":"PURPLE TRANSLUCENT/WHITE","retail_price":"399.93","sale_price":"399.93"}}}
