{"sku":"857627","manufacturer_id":"10546100005","brand_name":"Burton","product_name":"Burton Mission Snowboard Bindings - 2013/2014","long_description":"With smooth flex, built-in cushioning that softens landings and fully-adjustable highbacks that dial-in stance, it's no wonder Burton Mission snowboard bindings are an all-mountain favorite. Re:Flex minimized, cored baseplates dramatically improve board flex and feel, reduce weight and allow a variety of cushioning options. Short-glass fiber/nylon baseplates feature gapless EVA toe and heel pads; adjustable toe ramps reduce toe drag and increase responsiveness. FullBED(TM) cushioning covers the entire baseplate, and shock-absorbent damping pads eat up vibrations, sudden impacts and rough terrain so you don't have to. Canted Living Hinge(TM) Zero-Lean highbacks offers a playful, relaxed fit and feel; highbacks can be cranked forward for a more aggressive stance. Superstrap(TM) ankle straps feature precurved spines molded to match the shape of your feet and ankles; gel padding dials in comfort. Gettagrip capstrap toe straps feature a slim, 3D design; rubber material grips boot toes for a secure, locked-down fit. Smooth Glide(TM) buckles deliver buttery-smooth and reliable ratcheting power season after season. Burton Mission bindings are compatible with traditional 3D(TM), 4x4 bolt patterns and The Channel.","short_description":"With smooth flex, built-in cushioning that softens landings and fully-adjustable highbacks that dial-in stance, it's no wonder Burton Mission snowboard bindings are an all-mountain favorite.","category":"Snowboarding","subcategory":"Snowboard Bindings","product_group":"Strap Snowboard Bindings","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s383019.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l383019.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=383019&tt=df","retail_price":"199.95","sale_price":"139.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=383019\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m383019.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=857627&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8576270001":{"sku":"8576270001","vendor_sku":"10546100414","upc":"886888498302","size":"M","color":"TRUE BLUE","retail_price":"139.83","sale_price":"139.83"},"8576270002":{"sku":"8576270002","vendor_sku":"10546100414","upc":"886888498296","size":"L","color":"TRUE BLUE","retail_price":"139.83","sale_price":"139.83"}},"categories":["snow","snowboard-bindings","strap-snowboard-bindings"]}
