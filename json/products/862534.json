{"sku":"862534","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":"REI Magma Sleeping Bag","long_description":"A premium backpacking bag for cold, wet conditions, the REI Magma Sleeping Bag features REI's double-protection design, which uses both water-repellent down and waterproof/breathable fabric panels. With a European Norm (EN) lower-limit rating of 10degF, this bag is suitable for 3-season use and some winter outings. REI double-protection design combines a polymer-coated down fill with waterproof/breathable fabric at the hood, sides and foot, the areas most likely to touch a damp tent wall. Water-repellent 700-fill-power duck down offers superior loft and warmth. Ripstop nylon shell also features a durable water repellent finish to further protect the down fill. Performance fit keeps weight low and thermal efficiency high. REI in-the-round design puts vertical baffles in side walls to wrap you in warmth and create a better fit than bags that use only horizontal baffles. Contoured hood, draft collar and full-length draft tube all work to keep warmth in. Differentiated hood and neck drawcords simplify adjustments; antisnag zipper works smoothly. Any REI backpacking bag can be zipped to any other REI backpacking bag; women's bags zip on the right, unisex on the left. The REI Magma Sleeping Bag includes a nylon stuff sack and a large cotton storage bag. European Norm (EN) is an independent third-party temperature rating, allowing accurate comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags.","short_description":"A premium backpacking bag for cold, wet conditions, the REI Magma Sleeping Bag features REI's double-protection design, which uses both water-repellent down and waterproof/breathable fabric panels.","category":"Camping & Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags","product_group":"Adult Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s358711.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l358711.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=358711&tt=df","keywords":"cold,sleep,insulated,sleeping,winter","retail_price":"419.00","sale_price":"419.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=358711\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m358711.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=862534&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8625340001":{"sku":"8625340001","vendor_sku":"16299","upc":"486253400017","size":"Regular Left","color":"RED PLUM","retail_price":"399.00","sale_price":"399.00"},"8625340002":{"sku":"8625340002","vendor_sku":"16299","upc":"486253400024","size":"Long Left","color":"RED PLUM","retail_price":"419.00","sale_price":"419.00"}}}
