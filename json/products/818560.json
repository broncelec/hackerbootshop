Mid-calf uppers made from waterproof nubuck leather and reinforced with seam sealing; D-rings attach to your gaiters for a more complete seal against snow and debris. PrimaLoft(R) Eco 400g insulation-derived from recycled materials-paves a path to warmth and comfort. Dri-Lex(R) fleece linings are soft and moisture-wicking for a cozy fit all day long. Compression-molded EVA midsoles provide lightweight, flexible and impact-resistant cushioning. Removable dual-density footbeds deliver extra padding under heel and forefoot.
