{"sku":"828433","manufacturer_id":"033738-315-1-S/","brand_name":"Osprey","product_name":" Osprey Kestrel 38 Pack","long_description":"The sleek Osprey Kestrel 38 pack sports a technical design with an adjustable torso and lightweight materials, making it an ideal pack for long days or quick overnight adventures. Mesh-covered, die-cut EVA hipbelt saves weight and enhances breathability. Pack fits a wide variety of backs thanks to rip-and-stick, torso-length adjustability: just rip it, adjust it and stick it. Back panel features ridge-molded foam with channels covered in mesh to allow airflow. Peripheral-hoop alloy frame and HDPE framesheet provide a flexible and light structure. Top-loading design features a sewn-on lid with a pocket that offers easily accessible gear storage. Externally accessible lower compartment accommodates a sleeping bag. Trekking pole attachment lets you stow and remove poles (not included) while wearing pack. Poles tuck away between your arm and pack; adjustable shockcord on left-hand shoulder strap and a side loop hold poles in tightly. Front and side stretch-woven pockets are ideal for stashing a jacket and other often-used gear. Hipbelt features 2 zippered pockets for stashing a digital camera and snacks. Hydration-compatible design features reservoir sleeve and drink tube exit port for on-the-go hydration (reservoir sold separately). 2 ice axe loops with bungee tool tie-offs let you lash extra gear outside. Dual sleeping pad straps on the pack's base adjust easily to hold a variety of shapes and sizes of pads. Side compression straps let you cinch down loads for jostle-free carrying. The Osprey Kestrel 38 pack features an integrated raincover that pulls out in a flash to protect contents from sudden downpours.","short_description":"The sleek Osprey Kestrel 38 pack sports a technical design with an adjustable torso and lightweight materials, making it an ideal pack for long days or quick overnight adventures.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Backpacks","product_group":"Day Packs","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s411035.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l411035.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=411035&tt=df","retail_price":"159.95","sale_price":"159.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=411035\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m411035.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=828433&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8284330001":{"sku":"8284330001","vendor_sku":"033738-315-1-S/","upc":"877257011802","size":"S/M","color":"FIRE RED","retail_price":"159.95","sale_price":"159.95"},"8284330002":{"sku":"8284330002","vendor_sku":"033738-315-2-M/","upc":"877257011819","size":"M/L","color":"FIRE RED","retail_price":"159.95","sale_price":"159.95"},"8284330003":{"sku":"8284330003","vendor_sku":"033738-657-1-S/","upc":"877257011840","size":"S/M","color":"TARN BLUE","retail_price":"159.95","sale_price":"159.95"},"8284330004":{"sku":"8284330004","vendor_sku":"033738-657-2-M/","upc":"877257011857","size":"M/L","color":"TARN BLUE","retail_price":"159.95","sale_price":"159.95"},"8284330005":{"sku":"8284330005","vendor_sku":"033738-771-1-S/","upc":"877257011864","size":"S/M","color":"CONIFER GREEN","retail_price":"159.95","sale_price":"159.95"},"8284330006":{"sku":"8284330006","vendor_sku":"033738-771-2-M/","upc":"877257011871","size":"M/L","color":"CONIFER GREEN","retail_price":"159.95","sale_price":"159.95"}}}
