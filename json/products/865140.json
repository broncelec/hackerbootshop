Open mesh uppers are designed to maximize moisture management and offer plenty of breathability; synthetic overlays help provide lightweight support and stability. Seamless materials reduce the potential for irritation and friction caused by traditional stitches and seams. Elastic laces enable an adaptive, snug fit that combines with enhanced heel and tongue grips to make transitions smooth, fast and easy. Lightweight polymer midsoles offer support and stability with enhanced control for stable, responsive performance through your entire stride. GEL(R) silicone-based inserts in the hindfoot and forefoot absorb excess shock in all directions, delivering cushioning and stability. Outsoles on the girls' ASICS GEL-Noosa Tri 9 GS Road-Running shoes are optimized for traction in wet conditions.","short_description":"Updated with chafe-free seamless construction and loaded with triathlon-specific features, the girls' ASICS GEL-Noosa Tri 9 GS Road-Running Shoes are built to breathe and transition fast on race day.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Kids' Footwear","product_group":"Kids' Shoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s461087.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l461087.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=461087&tt=df","retail_price":"75.00","sale_price":"75.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=461087\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m461087.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=865140&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8651400001":{"sku":"8651400001","vendor_sku":"C401N.3536","upc":"887749244526","size":"Kids 1","color":"HOT PINK/NEON PURPLE/YELL","retail_price":"75.00","sale_price":"75.00"},"8651400002":{"sku":"8651400002","vendor_sku":"C401N.3536","upc":"887749244540","size":"Kids 2","color":"HOT PINK/NEON PURPLE/YELL","retail_price":"75.00","sale_price":"75.00"},"8651400003":{"sku":"8651400003","vendor_sku":"C401N.3536","upc":"887749244564","size":"Kids 3","color":"HOT PINK/NEON PURPLE/YELL","retail_price":"75.00","sale_price":"75.00"},"8651400004":{"sku":"8651400004","vendor_sku":"C401N.3536","upc":"887749244588","size":"Kids 4","color":"HOT PINK/NEON PURPLE/YELL","retail_price":"75.00","sale_price":"75.00"},"8651400005":{"sku":"8651400005","vendor_sku":"C401N.3536","upc":"887749244601","size":"Kids 5","color":"HOT PINK/NEON PURPLE/YELL","retail_price":"75.00","sale_price":"75.00"}},"categories":["footwear","kids-footwear","kids-shoes"]}
