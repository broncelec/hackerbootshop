Zebra(R) NXT photochromic lenses respond quickly to changing light conditions, darken in bright light and lighten in dim light. Polymer lens material provides exceptional optical clarity and visual comfort. Extremely flexible and impact-resistant, lenses are guaranteed not to scratch, break or crack. Lenses feature a long-lasting antifog coating that stops condensation from forming on lense surfaces. Nylon frame wraps close around the face for excellent peripheral protection. GripTech curved temples keep glasses in place, and can be worn under a helmet without sacrificing comfort. GripNose nose pads become tacky as you perspire, further helping keep eyewear in place. The Julbo Stunt photochromic sunglasses come with a protective case.","short_description":"The Julbo Stunt photochromic sunglasses bring style and performance to the single track.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sunglasses","product_group":"Sport Sunglasses","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s423231.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l423231.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=423231&tt=df","keywords":"Cycling","retail_price":"160.00","sale_price":"160.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=423231\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m423231.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=851656&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8516560001":{"sku":"8516560001","vendor_sku":"4383114","size":"ZEBRA PHOTOCHROMIC","color":"BLACK/MOTIVES","retail_price":"160.00","sale_price":"160.00"}}}
