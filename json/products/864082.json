{"sku":"864082","manufacturer_id":"21990-9197","brand_name":"Marmot","product_name":" Marmot Ouray Sleeping Bag - Women's","long_description":"A great winter bag or a 3-season choice for cold sleepers, the women's Marmot Ouray Sleeping Bag features water-resistant down insulation cleverly placed in critical heat loss areas. Designed to fit a woman's body, the Ouray offers increased room at hips, decreased room at shoulders and extra insulation in critical heat loss areas. With a European Norm (EN) comfort rating of 4degF, the Ouray sleeping bag is suitable for fall, winter and spring use. Certified 650-fill-power duck down insulation is protected by a durable nylon shell with a water-repellent finish. Down is treated to resist moisture to maintain warmth; treated down stays drier 10 times longer, maintains 150% more loft and dries 30% faster than untreated down. Nautilus 5-baffle hood envelops your head in warmth; face muff allows hood to be cinched snug without chafing your face. No more midnight drawcord fumbling-smooth, flat upper cord and hard, round lower cord make hood adjustments easy. Stretch tricot baffles provide strength and durability for long bag life. Trapezoidal footbox allows down to loft fully around your feet for optimum warmth and comfort; pocket in the footbox lets you slip in a hand warmer (sold separately). Stash pocket on the top chest near hood stows nighttime essentials. Heat bump draft tube backing the full-length, snag-free zipper prevents cold air from seeping through; down-filled collar adds warmth. Locking, two-way zipper prevents bag from inadvertently opening during the night. Ground-level side seams keep warm air from escaping. The women's Marmot Ouray Sleeping Bag includes a stuff sack and large storage bag. European Norm (EN) is an independent third-party temperature rating, allowing accurate comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags.","short_description":"A great winter bag or a 3-season choice for cold sleepers, the women's Marmot Ouray Sleeping Bag features water-resistant down insulation cleverly placed in critical heat loss areas.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags And Accessories","product_group":"Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s421567.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l421567.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=421567&tt=df","keywords":"compact","retail_price":"339.00","sale_price":"339.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=421567\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m421567.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=864082&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8640820001":{"sku":"8640820001","vendor_sku":"21980-9197","upc":"785562485136","size":"Regular Right","color":"SUNSET ORANGE/ORANGE SPIC","retail_price":"319.00","sale_price":"319.00"},"8640820002":{"sku":"8640820002","vendor_sku":"21990-9197","upc":"785562485174","size":"Long Right","color":"SUNSET ORANGE/ORANGE SPIC","retail_price":"339.00","sale_price":"339.00"}}}
