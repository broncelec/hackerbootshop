{"sku":"865325","manufacturer_id":"1201541B801.100","brand_name":"Brooks","product_name":"Brooks PureCadence 3 Road-Running Shoes - Women's","long_description":"Getting great support doesn't mean you have to wear a heavy shoe. The Brooks PureCadence Road-Running Shoes offer stability and a natural foot strike, all in a lightweight package. Lightweight uppers feature highly breathable mesh, synthetic leather overlays and a wide rubber instep band to provide a comfortable, secure fit regardless of foot shape. 4mm heel-to-toe drop encourages a natural midfoot or forefoot strike to promote forward momentum and reduce the impact of heel striking. Ideal Heel design uses a curved heel to encourage foot contact points to shift you forward, helping align joints and reduce stresses. Split toe groove under the forefoot offers an enhanced sense of connection with the ground. Midsoles feature BioMoGo polymer alloy foam, which provides cushioning, energy return and reduced foot fatigue; nontoxic additive helps midsoles break down in landfill. Low-profile rubber outsoles grip well on the road, sidewalk and gentle trails. Designed on an anatomical last, Brooks PureCadence 3 Road-Running Shoes contour to the feet, providing a glovelike fit.","short_description":"Getting great support doesn't mean you have to wear a heavy shoe.
