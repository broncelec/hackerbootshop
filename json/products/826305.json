{"sku":"826305","manufacturer_id":"332120C","brand_name":"Julbo","product_name":" Julbo Looping II Sunglasses - Kids'","long_description":"There's no wrong way to wear these Julbo Looping II symmetrically shaped sunglasses designed for infants and toddlers who spend time outside with mom and dad. Free of finger-pinching hinges, these have flexible temples that let kids pull the sunglasses on and off repeatedly without damaging the frames. Rubber temple inserts and nose pads help keep glasses securely on a child's face. Paint-free design prevents problems if a toddler opts to chew on the frame. Spectron 4 polycarbonate lenses offer 100% UV protection and block 95% visible light, reducing glare and creating a clear image. Lightweight polycarbonate lenses are 20 times more impact resistant than glass and less than one-third the weight. Comes with a soft microfiber storage pouch. Includes a detachable, adjustable elastic retainer strap that clips in and out of the temple-end holes. Best fits kids ages 12 - 24 months.","short_description":"There's no wrong way to wear these Julbo Looping II symmetrically shaped sunglasses designed for infants and toddlers who spend time outside with mom and dad.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sunglasses","product_group":"Kids' Sunglasses","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s422679.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l422679.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=422679&tt=df","retail_price":"32.00","sale_price":"32.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=422679\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m422679.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=826305&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8263050002":{"sku":"8263050002","vendor_sku":"332120C","size":"Spectron 4","color":"GREY","retail_price":"32.00","sale_price":"32.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sunglasses","kids-sunglasses"]}
