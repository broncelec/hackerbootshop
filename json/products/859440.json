{"sku":"859440","manufacturer_id":"LBC6000","brand_name":"Lange","product_name":"Lange SX 120 Ski Boots - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Forget the idea that painful feet are necessary for a fun day. The intermediate-level Lange SX 120 ski boots feature roomy footbeds to keep you comfortable while you enjoy the slopes. With a medium flex index, Lange SX 120 ski boots provide the responsive power transfer preferred by aggressive intermediate skiers. Roomy, 102mm footbeds offer a comfortable fit and can accommodate wide feet. Uniform-density plastic shells ensure highly efficient power transfer, smooth flex and finely-tuned responsiveness, even in frigid temperatures. Shells are designed to create a centered, balanced stance on rockered skis to increase efficiency of technique and reduce fatigue. Liners comfortably contour your feet and precisely match the internal shape of the shell to create instant responsiveness, and they may be custom molded using a heat treatment. 1-piece toe boxes and tongues eliminate seams and overlaps in the tongue attachment area, reducing pressure points at the instep and top of the toes. Specially designed insteps provide an excellent fit at the midfoot, resulting in increased circulation and greater warmth. Saddle-stitched seams help reduce hotspots. Rubber soles offer excellent grip.","short_description":"Forget the idea that painful feet are necessary for a fun day.
