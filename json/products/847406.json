{"sku":"847406","manufacturer_id":"CSB12525RER","brand_name":"Nemo","product_name":" NEMO Harmony 25 Sleeping Bag - Women's","long_description":"NEMO doesn't think we all sleep like mummies! The Harmony 25 women's sleeping bag finds a middle ground for the living and breaks the mold of sleeping bag shapes. The new NEMO Spoon Shape is wide in the shoulders, tapers to hips and then gently flares back out to allow room for the natural bend and shift of knees. PrimaLoft(R) Synergy synthetic microfiber insulation works a lot like down: it minimizes bulkiness, packs down well and stays warm even when wet. Underside of sleeping bag features 10% less insulation than the topside to cut down on weight; insulation underneath is often flattened, thus less doesn't hinder performance. Waterproof/breathable coating on backside of fabric combined with a Durable Water Repellent on the exterior protects from tent wall condensation. A nifty little feature in the hood is the tuckable Blanket Fold(TM), an insulated flap of fabric that can be wrapped around neck to block drafts and add a layer of warmth. NEMO Harmony 25 women's sleeping bag comes with a compression stuff sack and storage bag.","short_description":"NEMO doesn't think we all sleep like mummies!
