{"sku":"849391","manufacturer_id":"32569414","brand_name":"Mavic","product_name":"Mavic Ksyrium SL S Wheelset with Tires","long_description":"Taking weight savings seriously, the Mavic Ksyrium SL S wheelset sheds grams while maintaining reliability and high-end performance. 22mm deep front and 25mm deep rear rims are strengthened where the spokes exert the greatest stress; rear rim utilizes an asymmetric shape to enhance stiffness and durability. Lightweight yet strong proprietary aluminum rims have a drilling method that doesn't penetrate the tube-facing wall, strengthening rim and eliminating the need for rim strips. Both rims feature a milled braking surface to improve friction; rim joints are welded and milled to eliminate shuddering during braking and provide superior wheel balance. Inter Spoke Milling 3D dramatically reduces material between spokes and along sides of rims, reducing weight and making them well-suited to climbing and fast acceleration. Rear hub features a lightweight and stiff aluminum hub body with pawls that are backed by stainless-steel inserts for reliable, strong engagement and power transfer. Both hubs boast a microadjustable system that lets you dial in bearing performance; double-sealed cartridge bearings deliver excellent longevity and smooth spinning. Lightweight double-butted straight-pull, bladed alloy spokes are laced radially on the front wheel; rear has radial lacing on the drive-side, 2-cross on the non-drive-side. Yksion Pro 700x23c clincher tires are included, offering front- and rear-specific performance for maximizing grip up front and minimizing rolling resistance in the back. Both tires have supple 127 tpi casings and are backed with a superior, puncture-resistant Kevlar(R) breaker; maximum recommended pressure of 130 psi (9 bar). Please note: tubes use Presta valves. The Mavic Kysrium SL S wheelset with tires comes with magnet (front wheel), quick-release skewers and a multifunction adjustment wrench. 100mm front and 130mm rear axle spacing.","short_description":"Taking weight savings seriously, the Mavic Ksyrium SL S wheelset sheds grams while maintaining reliability and high-end performance.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Components","product_group":"Bike Tires, Tubes And Wheels","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s389571.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l389571.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=389571&tt=df","retail_price":"1149.95","sale_price":"1149.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=389571\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m389571.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=849391&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8493910001":{"sku":"8493910001","vendor_sku":"32569414","upc":"080694811809","size":"700C","retail_price":"1149.95","sale_price":"1149.95"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-components","bike-tires-tubes-and-wheels"]}
