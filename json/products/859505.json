{"sku":"859505","manufacturer_id":"J131601201255","brand_name":"Full Tilt","product_name":" Full Tilt Mary Jane Ski Boots - Women's - 2013/2014","long_description":"The Full Tilt Mary Jane women's ski boots blast through intermediate-level terrain and keep you happy with their one-of-a-kind flex, roomy 102mm width and women-specific cuffs. 3-piece shell includes separate cuff, shell and tongue sections that come together to create a classic fit. Shell design allows the use of thin plastic to reduce overall weight, and ensures an even flex pattern with specialized tongues. 5 ribs (separate sections) on tongues provide an even, uniform flex, and cables work like shoelaces to even out pressure and reduce shin bang. Tongues hinge out of the way making it a breeze to get your feet into the boots. Women-specific cuffs match a woman's anatomical lower calf shape, and women-specific lasts are designed for your feet and ankles. Liners feature 7mm medium-density foam that molds to your feet through use, but they can also be custom molded using a heat treatment at an REI specialty ski shop. An additional 4mm layer of foam, as well as spacious toe boxes, enhance warmth and comfort. Shock-absorbent bootboards reduce the jarring impact of big-air landings and smooth out vibrations at high speed. Full Tilt Mary Jane ski boots provide the responsive power transfer preferred by intermediate skiers; Full Tilt rates the flex as a 4 out of 10. 102mm footbeds provide a great fit for wide feet.","short_description":"The Full Tilt Mary Jane women's ski boots blast through intermediate-level terrain and keep you happy with their one-of-a-kind flex, roomy 102mm width and women-specific cuffs.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Downhill Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382643.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382643.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382643&tt=df","retail_price":"399.95","sale_price":"239.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382643\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382643.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859505&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8595050001":{"sku":"8595050001","vendor_sku":"J131601201235","upc":"886745200871","size":"Mondo 23.5","retail_price":"239.93","sale_price":"239.93"},"8595050002":{"sku":"8595050002","vendor_sku":"J131601201245","upc":"886745200895","size":"Mondo 24.5","retail_price":"239.93","sale_price":"239.93"},"8595050003":{"sku":"8595050003","vendor_sku":"J131601201255","upc":"886745200918","size":"Mondo 25.5","retail_price":"239.93","sale_price":"239.93"},"8595050004":{"sku":"8595050004","vendor_sku":"J131601201265","upc":"886745200932","size":"Mondo 26.5","retail_price":"239.93","sale_price":"239.93"}},"categories":["snow","ski-boots","downhill-ski-boots"]}
