Excess ammonia interferes with glycogen production and thereby disrupts your energy output. Anti-Fatique caps contain potassium magnesium aspartate, L-citrulline and ornithine alpha-ketoglutarate to scavenge ammonia and help produce energy-boosting glutamine. Take 2 - 4 capsules 1 hr. prior to workouts or races, and 1 capsule per hr. during workouts or races. Capsules are made from an all-vegetable material. Gluten free. Bottle contains 90 capsules. *Discount will be applied when you check out; offer not valid for sale-price items ending in $._3 or $._9.","short_description":"Hammer Nutrition Anti-Fatigue caps help you stay strong throughout the day by removing energy-robbing ammonia that accummulates during extended exercise.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Camp Kitchen","product_group":"Food","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s415815.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l415815.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=415815&tt=df","retail_price":"20.00","sale_price":"20.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=415815\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m415815.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=803378&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8033780019":{"sku":"8033780019","vendor_sku":"AFC","upc":"602059541901","retail_price":"20.00","sale_price":"20.00"}}}
