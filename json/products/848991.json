Amundson Source stand up paddleboard for a spin and enjoy best-in-class stability. 34 in. width, 250L volume and 300 lb. capacity means 11 ft. 10 in. Amundson Source paddleboard rides high in the water and feels rock-solid underfoot. It's perfect for first-time paddlers, large paddlers, tandem rides with the kids or tandem rides with a furry, 4-legged buddy. Epoxy and fiberglass layered over an EPS foam core creates lightweight flotation with high durability. Slight rocker and smooth outline enhance tracking on flatwater and maneuverability in light surf. Flat bottom enhances stability and flat deck makes for a more comfortable standing area. You'll have an easy time staying on the board thanks to the high traction of the EVA deck pad; deck pad extends all the way to the nose to give tandem riders extra traction. 10 in. center fin enhances tracking. Grip and carry the 34 lb. board at the center of the board with the heavy-duty molded handle. Includes tie-down points on forward deck for PFDs or gear.","short_description":"Take the 11 ft. 10 in.
