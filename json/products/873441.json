Breath-O-Prene patented technology surrounds injured paw with comfortable, breathable padding. Breath-O-Prene also wicks moisture away from skin and helps it evaporate quickly, reducing the risk of bacteria build-up that could cause infections. Wrap-around design with extra-strong rip-and-stick tab provides a snug fit with less twisting so bootie and bandage stay in place. Reusable bootie lasts throughout the recovery process and can also be used as an everyday slipper. Fabric is water-resistant and machine-washable.
