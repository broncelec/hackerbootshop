Hybrid design works well as an under layer or outer layer. Features Polartec(R) Wind Pro(R) with Hardface(R) Technology in key areas: jacket front, then wrapping over the shoulders and down to mid-back. Wind Pro's durable face is water repellent and abrasion resistant; the Durable Water Repellent finish adds extra protection. Remaining areas of main body use super breathable, stretchy and wicking Polartec(R) Power Dry(R) fabric; smooth jersey face slides easily beneath layers. Warm brushed-fleece interior moves moisture quickly to the fabric face. Microfleece-lined collar and chin guard; stretch binding on armholes and hem. Zippered handwarmer pockets are pack- and harness-compatible. Vest is shoulder-seam-free for comfort underneath a pack. Polartec Wind Pro contains 50% recycled polyester/40% polyester/10% spandex. Polartec Power Dry contains 54% recycled polyester/40% polyester/6% spandex. Patagonia Piton Hybrid fleece vest has a slim fit.","short_description":"On blustery approaches, chilly rock routes and full-on alpine missions, the Patagonia Piton Hybrid fleece vest takes the edge off.
