{"sku":"858673","manufacturer_id":"300011","brand_name":"Dalbello","product_name":" Dalbello KR 2 Pro I.D. Ski Boots - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"With a shell that contours your foot shape and top-notch Intuition ID liners that mold to your feet, the stiff, expert-level Dalbello KR Two Pro I.D. ski boots balance comfort with precision. Boot mold enhances power, precision and comfort by matching 4 critical fit points: the heels, ankles, 5th metatarsals near your toes and the naviculars near insteps. 98mm footbed provides a responsive, precision fit designed for discriminating feet. Among the highest-quality liners available, the anatomically shaped Intuition I.D. liners offer a low-volume, performance fit that improves sensitivity and responsiveness. High-density Ultralon EVA foam in the Intuition ID liners is lighter and warmer than standard foams and can be shaped to accommodate specific fit issues. Offering a precise foothold and a progressive forward flex, 3-piece shell optimizes responsiveness for modern ski shapes. Separate cuff, shell and tongue sections are joined together to create a smooth forward flex with precise side-to-side support. Enhancing side-to-side response and providing a snugger wrap, bi-injected cuffs feature stiff plastic on sides and soft plastic on the straps that wrap around shins. Tweak the fit with 2 interchangeable tongues (stiff installed and medium included), 2 interchangable footboards (firm installed and antishock included). Twin canting adjusts the cuffs to fit the angles of your lower legs, levels the soles of the boots above the skis and offers a versatile range of adjustment. Cable instep buckle on each boot minimizes foot sliding, heel lift and shell distortion while flexing, and a specialized adjustment fine-tunes the cable tension.","short_description":"With a shell that contours your foot shape and top-notch Intuition ID liners that mold to your feet, the stiff, expert-level Dalbello KR Two Pro I.D. ski boots balance comfort with precision.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Downhill Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382523.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382523.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382523&tt=df","retail_price":"699.95","sale_price":"699.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382523\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382523.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=858673&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8586730001":{"sku":"8586730001","vendor_sku":"300011","upc":"616438301505","size":"Mondo 26.5","color":"ACID GREEN/ANTHRACITE","retail_price":"699.95","sale_price":"699.95"},"8586730002":{"sku":"8586730002","vendor_sku":"300011","upc":"616438301529","size":"Mondo 27.5","color":"ACID GREEN/ANTHRACITE","retail_price":"699.95","sale_price":"699.95"},"8586730003":{"sku":"8586730003","vendor_sku":"300011","upc":"616438301543","size":"Mondo 28.5","color":"ACID GREEN/ANTHRACITE","retail_price":"699.95","sale_price":"699.95"},"8586730004":{"sku":"8586730004","vendor_sku":"300011","upc":"616438301567","size":"Mondo 29.5","color":"ACID GREEN/ANTHRACITE","retail_price":"699.95","sale_price":"699.95"}},"categories":["snow","ski-boots","downhill-ski-boots"]}
