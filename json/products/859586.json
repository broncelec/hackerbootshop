{"sku":"859586","manufacturer_id":"46109 00001","brand_name":"Ortovox","product_name":" Ortovox Tour 32 + 7 ABS Avalanche Airbag Pack","long_description":"With a light and low-profile airbag inflation system, the Ortovox Tour 32 + 7 ABS Avalanche Airbag pack serves up protection for ski enthusiasts and professionals venturing into the backcountry. With a simple pull of the easy-to-reach ABS release handle, low-resistance air intake inflates the airbags quickly to help you stay at or near the surface of an avalanche. Modular airbag system and steel air cylinders can be easily removed from the pack when you are staying in bounds or enjoying snow-free adventures. Locking aluminum clasps and super tough Hypalon straps let you carry skis diagonally, vertically or crossed, or a snowboard vertically. Padded, anatomically shaped shoulder straps and a wide hipbelt work together to distribute weight between the shoulders and hips for comfortable carring all day long. The Ortovox Tour 32 + 7 ABS Avalanche Airbag pack features a locking hipbelt buckle and leg straps to help ensure that you remain attached to the pack in an avalanche. Pack includes a map compartment, helmet net, skin/crampon compartment, a media pocket, a cushioned goggles pocket and ice axe/trekking pole loops.","short_description":"With a light and low-profile airbag inflation system, the Ortovox Tour 32 + 7 ABS Avalanche Airbag pack serves up protection for ski enthusiasts and professionals venturing into the backcountry.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Mountaineering Gear","product_group":"Avalanche Safety Gear","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s407407.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l407407.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=407407&tt=df","retail_price":"1203.00","sale_price":"961.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=407407\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m407407.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859586&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8595860001":{"sku":"8595860001","vendor_sku":"46109 00001","size":"32 LTR","color":"BLACK/ANTHRACITE","retail_price":"961.93","sale_price":"961.93"}}}
