{"sku":"859250","manufacturer_id":"L32598700","brand_name":"Salomon","product_name":"Salomon Quest 80 Ski Boots - Women's - 2013/2014","long_description":"With a ski/hike switch to make walking around a cinch, the novice-level Salomon Quest Access 80 W women's ski boots offers a fit to suit the needs of female skiers and enhance comfort on the slopes. Specialized ski/hike mechanism frees the upper cuff from the lower part of the boot to allow comfortable movement for hiking and walking. When you're ready to ski, the cuffs lock directly into the lower shells to maximize power transmission on the descent. Snug 100mm footbeds balance comfort with performance. Women-specific liners feature a wider forefoot area, low volume around the ankle and an upper cuff shaped for women's calf muscles. Innovative V-shaped lower shell and magnesium backbone virtually eliminate flex when backbone is engaged. Relatively soft plastic in upper cuffs and shells makes it easy to get your feet into the boots. Comfortable liners feature a layer of custom-formable foam that personalizes the fit around the shins. Layers of wool and metallic polyester fibers boost insulation. You won't have to strain to get your boots buckled; top buckle conveniently ratchets down the cuff and offers 4cm of adjustment. With a soft flex index of 80, the women's Salomon Quest 80 W ski boots provide a light flex suitable for novice skiers.","short_description":"With a ski/hike switch to make walking around a cinch, the novice-level Salomon Quest Access 80 W women's ski boots offers a fit to suit the needs of female skiers and enhance comfort on the slopes.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Downhill Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382543.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382543.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382543&tt=df","retail_price":"399.00","sale_price":"318.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382543\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382543.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859250&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8592500001":{"sku":"8592500001","vendor_sku":"L32598700","upc":"080694064922","size":"Mondo 23.5","color":"COLD SEA TRANLUCENT/WHITE","retail_price":"318.93","sale_price":"318.93"},"8592500002":{"sku":"8592500002","vendor_sku":"L32598700","upc":"080694064953","size":"Mondo 24.5","color":"COLD SEA TRANLUCENT/WHITE","retail_price":"318.93","sale_price":"318.93"},"8592500003":{"sku":"8592500003","vendor_sku":"L32598700","upc":"080694064977","size":"Mondo 25.5","color":"COLD SEA TRANLUCENT/WHITE","retail_price":"318.93","sale_price":"318.93"},"8592500004":{"sku":"8592500004","vendor_sku":"L32598700","upc":"080694064991","size":"Mondo 26.5","color":"COLD SEA TRANLUCENT/WHITE","retail_price":"318.93","sale_price":"318.93"}},"categories":["snow","ski-boots","downhill-ski-boots"]}
