{"sku":"830938","manufacturer_id":"041LL","brand_name":"Sea To Summit","product_name":"Sea to Summit Trek Tk I Sleeping Bag","long_description":"The lightweight Sea to Summit Trek TkI down sleeping bag keeps you warm in a broad range of environments and activities, whether you're tramping in New Zealand or road-tripping across the States. Insulated with high-loft 650-fill-power duck down for warmth, light weight and compressibility; Ultra-Dry Down(TM) water-repellent treatment protects down from moisture. Ultra-Dry Down is a water-repellent polymer treatment applied to the 650-fill down; Ultra-Dry Down retains 60% more loft and absorbs 30% less moisture than untreated down. With a European Norm (EN) lower-limit rating of 32degF, the TkII bag will help keep you warm in mild weather. Shell fabric is constructed of 2D PermaShell(TM) technology, a high-density weave, 33-denier fabric treated with a Durable Water Repellent finish. Shell material is highly vapor permeable and downproof. Lining is a breathable, durable 40-denier nylon fabric with a soft touch. Full-length side zipper and foot zipper allow bag to be converted from sleeping bag to a duvet/down comforter; this also allows 2 Sea to Summit bags to be zipped together. Oversize draft tube backing the 2-way zipper keeps the warmth in and the cold out; zipper is backed by stiff, antisnag tape for smooth operation. Semirectangular shape provides more room than a mummy bag for a more comfortable sleeping bag while maintaining thermal efficiency. 2-dimensional hood features drawcord adjustment to cinch and tighten around head; hood is designed to open flat when sleeping bag is used as a duvet/down comforter;. Differentially cut inner layer is smaller than the outer layer to create a consistent thickness of insulation that precludes cold spots. Large zippered interior secuity pocket is great for stowing a few essentials, alleviating middle-of-the-night fumbling and preserving battery performance in cold weather.","short_description":"The lightweight Sea to Summit Trek TkI down sleeping bag keeps you warm in a broad range of environments and activities, whether you're tramping in New Zealand or road-tripping across the States.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags And Accessories","product_group":"Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s421279.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l421279.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=421279&tt=df","keywords":"compact","retail_price":"269.00","sale_price":"269.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=421279\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m421279.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=830938&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8309380001":{"sku":"8309380001","vendor_sku":"041LL","size":"Long Left","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"269.00","sale_price":"269.00"},"8309380002":{"sku":"8309380002","vendor_sku":"041RL","size":"Regular Left","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"249.00","sale_price":"249.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sleeping-bags-and-accessories","sleeping-bags"]}
