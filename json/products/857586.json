{"sku":"857586","manufacturer_id":"BUS05427","brand_name":"Novara","product_name":" Novara Strada Bike - 2014","long_description":"With a Shimano 105 drivetrain, butted aluminum frame and carbon fiber fork, our Novara Strada(R) road bike is a swift, smooth performer for fitness rides, club rides and centuries. Butted aluminum frame features shaped seatstays and top tube for enhanced comfort and performance; flat weld head tube improves strength and handling precision. Fork boasts a tapered alloy steerer with a machined, 1-piece alloy crown for strength and stiffness where it counts; carbon legs help damp road vibrations and reduce weight. Shimano 105 shifters and derailleurs offer high-end shifting performance and dependability without an astronomical price tag. Compact crankset and wide-ranging 12-30 cassette deliver the gearing versatility of a triple crankset without the weight or finicky shifting. Compact crankset is mechanically simpler and more reliable than a triple crankset; and it delivers virtually the same gearing. Shimano long-reach caliper brakes are compatible with fenders (not included) and deliver dependable braking power. Sturdy Weinmann rims, dependable Novatech hubs and Clement Strada LGG tires provide smooth-rolling performance. Eyelets for fenders let you outfit the Strada for wet-weather or commuting (not included). Replaceable rear derailleur hanger helps extend the usable life of the frame. Specs on our Novara Strada road bike are subject to change.","short_description":"With a Shimano 105 drivetrain, butted aluminum frame and carbon fiber fork, our Novara Strada(R) road bike is a swift, smooth performer for fitness rides, club rides and centuries.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bikes","product_group":"Road Bikes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s374547.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l374547.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=374547&tt=df","retail_price":"1099.00","sale_price":"1099.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=374547\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m374547.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=857586&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8575860001":{"sku":"8575860001","vendor_sku":"BUS05427","upc":"485758600014","size":"S","color":"WHITE","retail_price":"1099.00","sale_price":"1099.00"},"8575860002":{"sku":"8575860002","vendor_sku":"BUS05427","upc":"485758600021","size":"M","color":"WHITE","retail_price":"1099.00","sale_price":"1099.00"},"8575860003":{"sku":"8575860003","vendor_sku":"BUS05427","upc":"485758600038","size":"L","color":"WHITE","retail_price":"1099.00","sale_price":"1099.00"},"8575860004":{"sku":"8575860004","vendor_sku":"BUS05427","upc":"485758600045","size":"XL","color":"WHITE","retail_price":"1099.00","sale_price":"1099.00"}}}
