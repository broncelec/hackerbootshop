Crotch is reinforced with Schoeller(R) fabric to enhance durability and minimize chafing. 2 front hand pockets, single coin pocket and 2 back drop-in pockets make up the classic 5-pocket style and utility; bottoms of back pockets are reinforced for durability. Rolling up pant cuff exposes reflective tape, which helps boost your visibility to motorists. Right pant cuff also features an internal drawstring, letting you cinch up the cuff and keep it out of your bike's drivetrain. When you're riding, you can tuck in rear pocket flaps to expose reflective trim, enhancing your visibility to others. U-lock holster is integrated with back waistband to make it easy to carry your lock as you ride.
