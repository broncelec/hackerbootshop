{"sku":"846437","manufacturer_id":"020485-624-3-WM","brand_name":"Osprey","product_name":"Osprey Xena 85 Pack - Women's","long_description":"The Osprey Xena 85 pack offers women-specific comfort for carrying large loads on extended trips. Its beefed up frame and deluxe suspension provide a supportive and highly customizable fit. Custom-moldable, anatomically contoured BioForm4 CM(TM) hipbelt and shoulder straps have gender-specific angles, balancing firmness and cushioning for support and comfort. Osprey certified custom molding is available in most REI stores-check your local store for a custom hipbelt molding oven. Back panel is lined with reversed spacer mesh for a smooth and breathable contact surface. Peripheral frame effectively transfers weight to the hipbelt; single 6061-T6 aluminum center stay helps maintain back panel shape. Top-loading main compartment can also be accessed through curved side zippers on each side of the pack body; wide-mouth sleeping bag compartment is easy to load and unload. Dual-compartment top pocket converts to lumbar pack with built-in belt. External hydration sleeve in the back panel simplifies refilling and helps protect pack contents from spills (hydration reservoir sold separately). Roomy front pockets with coated zippers help keep often-used items handy; stretch-mesh front pocket makes it easy to quickly stash and access extra gear. Zippered hipbelt pockets and dual-access stretch mesh side pockets provide secure storage and organization. The Osprey Xena 85 pack features dual side compression straps, removable sleeping pad straps, trekking pole attachment and 2 ice-axe loops and handle wraps.","short_description":"The Osprey Xena 85 pack offers women-specific comfort for carrying large loads on extended trips.
