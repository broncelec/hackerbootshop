{"sku":"810386","manufacturer_id":"05208","brand_name":"Therm-A-Rest","product_name":" Therm-a-Rest RidgeRest SOlite Sleeping Pad","long_description":"A counterpart to the RidgeRest Solar, the Therm-a-Rest SOLite sleeping pad is lighter yet also features an aluminized surface to reflect body heat for a boost in warmth and comfort. Patented, molded design is constructed with a pattern of ridges and valleys to trap dead air, increasing insulation value. Aluminized surface reflects body heat back to your sleeping bag. Ridges make this pad softer and more comfortable than smooth closed-cell foam pads. Therm-a-Rest RidgeRest SOLite sleeping pad provides a durable layer of insulation that is ideal for 4-seasons of sleeping.","short_description":"A counterpart to the RidgeRest Solar, the Therm-a-Rest SOLite sleeping pad is lighter yet also features an aluminized surface to reflect body heat for a boost in warmth and comfort.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Pads, Cots And Hammocks","product_group":"Sleeping Pads","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s422115.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l422115.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=422115&tt=df","keywords":"mattress,mats","retail_price":"39.95","sale_price":"39.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=422115\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m422115.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=810386&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8103860014":{"sku":"8103860014","vendor_sku":"05208","upc":"481208542286","size":"Large /25X77","color":"SAGE/SILVER","retail_price":"39.95","sale_price":"39.95"},"8103860022":{"sku":"8103860022","vendor_sku":"05207","upc":"040818052075","size":"Reg /20X72","color":"SAGE/SILVER","retail_price":"29.95","sale_price":"29.95"},"8103860030":{"sku":"8103860030","vendor_sku":"05206","upc":"481208542309","size":"S/20 In X 48 In","color":"SAGE/SILVER","retail_price":"19.95","sale_price":"19.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sleeping-pads-cots-and-hammocks","sleeping-pads"]}
