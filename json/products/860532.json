{"sku":"860532","manufacturer_id":"7524N1.GA","brand_name":"Marker","product_name":"Marker Griffon 90 Downhill Ski Bindings","long_description":"Designed for advanced skiers starting at 80 lbs., the Marker Griffon 90 downhill ski bindings with 90mm brakes steer mid-wide boards down the mountain with complete control. DIN setting adjust from 4 - 13, a range suited to advanced skiers at high speeds. Composite toe and heel cups keep binding weight to a minimum, and a wide footprint offers excellent performance on mid-wide skis. Triple Pivot Elite toes have high energy absorption to prevent prerelease. Lightweight Inter-Pivot heels focus power in the direction of the boot soles and offer superior holding power and energy transfer. Freeride brakes ensure adequate clearance when skiing backward. Stainless-steel antifriction devices allow essential lateral boot movement despite dirty or worn soles or negative sliding friction. 90mm brakes fit most all-mountain wide skis; mounting configuration of the Marker Griffon 90 downhill ski bindings requires a 76mm minimum ski width.","short_description":"Designed for advanced skiers starting at 80 lbs., the Marker Griffon 90 downhill ski bindings with 90mm brakes steer mid-wide boards down the mountain with complete control.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Bindings","product_group":"Downhill Ski Bindings","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s461339.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l461339.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=461339&tt=df","retail_price":"229.00","sale_price":"229.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=461339\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m461339.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=860532&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8605320001":{"sku":"8605320001","vendor_sku":"7524N1.GA","upc":"883295104185","size":"90 MM","color":"BLACK/WHITE/TEAL","retail_price":"229.00","sale_price":"229.00"}},"categories":["snow","ski-bindings","downhill-ski-bindings"]}
