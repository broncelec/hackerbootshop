{"sku":"820428","manufacturer_id":"6020","brand_name":"Saris","product_name":"Saris CycleGlide 4-Bike Ceiling Mount Storage Rack","long_description":"Store up to 4 bikes overhead with the Saris CycleGlide 4-Bike Ceiling Mount storage rack, saving precious floor space with its clever sliding design. Simple rack system uses 2 tracks that mount to ceiling joists and allow the 4 included gliders to hold a bike from its wheels. Gliders, and the bikes hanging from them, can slide side to side to minimize the amount of space used when storing; plus, they allow easy access when it comes time to ride. Each glider is designed to hold 1 bicycle that weighs up to 50 lbs.; no more than 300 lbs. should be loaded onto the entire ceiling rack system. Requires an overhead area 6 ft. wide by 6 ft. deep and at least 11 in. from nearest wall. Head clearance will be diminished once bikes are hung from the storage rack; ensure you have adequate ceiling height or can install rack so that it doesn't impact traffic flow. The Saris CycleGlide storage rack includes two 76 in. tracks, four 55 in. gliders, 8 hooks and installation hardware; additional tools necessary for proper installation.","short_description":"Store up to 4 bikes overhead with the Saris CycleGlide 4-Bike Ceiling Mount storage rack, saving precious floor space with its clever sliding design.","category":"Car Racks","subcategory":"Garage Storage","product_group":"Bike Storage Racks","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s408315.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l408315.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=408315&tt=df","keywords":"stand","retail_price":"230.00","sale_price":"230.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=408315\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m408315.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=820428&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8204280001":{"sku":"8204280001","vendor_sku":"6020","upc":"012527005413","retail_price":"230.00","sale_price":"230.00"}},"categories":["car-racks","garage-storage","bike-storage-racks"]}
