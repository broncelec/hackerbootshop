{"sku":"784482","manufacturer_id":"AH2621BOP-FIRB","brand_name":"Panaracer","product_name":" Panaracer Fire XC Pro Bike Tire - 26 x 2.1","long_description":"The Fire XC Pro tire offers excellent traction and cornering over just about any terrain without the penalty of high rolling resistance or soft, fast-wearing tread. BAX technology weaves super-high-density, extremely narrow 0.14mm diameter cord into the casing for lightness and flexibility, improving resistance to cuts and abrasions. Proprietary anti-rebound rubber strips reduce the chance of pinch flats by an average of 40%. 3D Knobs positioned in multiple directions maintain traction and durability when riding on the tire's sides. Silica compounds added to the tread increases grip, and vastly improves tire life.","short_description":"The Fire XC Pro tire offers excellent traction and cornering over just about any terrain without the penalty of high rolling resistance or soft, fast-wearing tread.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Components","product_group":"Bike Tires, Tubes And Wheels","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s389271.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l389271.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=389271&tt=df","retail_price":"33.00","sale_price":"33.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=389271\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m389271.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=784482&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7844820014":{"sku":"7844820014","vendor_sku":"AH2621BOP-FIRB","upc":"705160003297","size":"26 In X 2.1 In","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"33.00","sale_price":"33.00"}}}
