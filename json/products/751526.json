{"sku":"751526","manufacturer_id":"210254","brand_name":"Black Diamond","product_name":" Black Diamond VaporLock Screwgate Locking Carabiner","long_description":"The ultralight Black Diamond VaporLock locking carabiner is an ideal choice for belaying, lowering and rappelling. Minimalist pear-shape design has a wide basket to allow use of a Munter hitch on ropes up to 9.4mm. When used in conjunction with an ATC the VaporLock effectively increases friction up to 30% during lowering or rappelling, helping maximize control. Made from anodized aluminum for lasting service. The sleeve locks on the gate, eliminating the possibility of the 'biner being over-tightened or ''frozen'' when loaded. Keylock nose will not snag on bolts or gear while clipping and unclipping. Locking mechanism comes in assorted colors only; sorry, specific color requests cannot be accommodated.","short_description":"The ultralight Black Diamond VaporLock locking carabiner is an ideal choice for belaying, lowering and rappelling.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Hardware","product_group":"Carabiners","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s375951.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l375951.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=375951&tt=df","retail_price":"14.95","sale_price":"14.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=375951\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m375951.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=751526&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7515260011":{"sku":"7515260011","vendor_sku":"210254","upc":"793661089117","color":"ASSORTED","retail_price":"14.95","sale_price":"14.95"}},"categories":["climbing","climbing-hardware","carabiners"]}
