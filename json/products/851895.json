Set the slackline up between 2 trees and have fun challenging your balance and core strength. 2-in.-wide nylon webbing is bit more stable and taut than a traditional 1-in.-wide slackline.

ENO SlackWire Slackline kit includes a carrying case.","short_description":"The ENO SlackWire Slackline kit is easy to transport and quick to set up so you can slackline at the park, in the backyard or around the campsite.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Webbing And Cords","product_group":"Slacklines","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s407731.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l407731.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=407731&tt=df","retail_price":"69.95","sale_price":"69.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=407731\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m407731.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=851895&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8518950001":{"sku":"8518950001","vendor_sku":"A1401","upc":"811201012071","color":"BLUE","retail_price":"69.95","sale_price":"69.95"}}}
