{"sku":"780271","manufacturer_id":"J16038","brand_name":"Merrell","product_name":" Merrell Siren Waterproof Mid Leather Hiking Boots - Women's","long_description":"Scramble in comfort! These Merrell Siren hiking boots supply adventurous spirits with waterproof protection and great looks. Waterproof, full-grain and synthetic leather uppers provide long-lasting performance and reliability; rubber toe bumpers and heel counters protect feet from rough terrain. Polyester mesh linings work with breathable mesh in the uppers to wick away excess sweat and promote ventilation. Padded, bellowed tongues relieve lace pressure and keep trail debris out; heel loops aid entry. Removable, anatomic Ortholite(R) footbeds are ventilated to help keep feet cool and dry. Q-Form(TM) triple-density, compression-molded EVA midsoles help maintain foot alignment and control pronation. Air Cushion(R) heel pockets in midsoles absorb shock and add stability. Injection-molded nylon arch shanks and thermoplastic urethane heel cups stabilize and support feet on uneven terrain. Vibram(R) Siren Song(TM) sticky rubber outsoles offer low-profile traction and excellent durability.","short_description":"Scramble in comfort!
