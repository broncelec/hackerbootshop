{"sku":"716230","manufacturer_id":"756598","brand_name":"Grivel","product_name":" Grivel G-12 New-Matic Crampons with Antibott Device","long_description":"These classic 12-point crampons are designed for general mountaineering, mixed climbing and moderate ice climbing. Made with strong chromoly steel, the semi-rigid construction is suitable for 3/4-shank boots. Flexible latex antibott sheets prevent snow build-up beneath the crampon. New-Matic bindings are simple and efficient, allowing use of new, lighter weight mountaineering boots without significant welts at the toes. Front Zytel straps attached to the front posts anchor the toes, while clip-in cams secure the heels; nylon ankle straps fasten with two ring buckles. Crampons adjust easily without tools; one size fits U.S. men's boot sizes 4 to 12 and European sizes 36-47.","short_description":"These classic 12-point crampons are designed for general mountaineering, mixed climbing and moderate ice climbing.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Mountaineering Gear","product_group":"Crampons","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s407459.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l407459.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=407459&tt=df","retail_price":"175.00","sale_price":"175.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=407459\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m407459.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=716230&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7162300011":{"sku":"7162300011","vendor_sku":"756598","size":"ONE SIZE","retail_price":"175.00","sale_price":"175.00"}},"categories":["climbing","mountaineering-gear","crampons"]}
