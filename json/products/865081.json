{"sku":"865081","manufacturer_id":"856-0492","brand_name":"Light & Motion","product_name":" Light & Motion Seca 1500 Race Bike Light","long_description":"Whether you're competing in 24-hr races or sneaking in a ride after work, the Light & Motion Seca 1500 Race bike light is a superb light for cyclists that balances brightness, beam pattern and weight. Reflector delivers a clean, even beam pattern that offers broad coverage and a long line of sight. Cruise mode sequentially cycles through high (1,500 lumens), medium (800 lumens), low (450 lumens) and flash light settings. Race mode conserves battery power by skipping medium and flash modes, offering just the low setting for climbing and the high setting, just a click away, for descents. Using a high-density 6-cell lithium ion battery, it offers a 2 hr. run time on its highest output setting; drop to lower power settings to extend run time. Smart Charger offers a 2.5 hr. recharge time. Low-profile, tool-free mount takes the hassle out of mounting your Light & Motion Seca 1500 Race light to handlebar or helmet; battery mounts to frame or drops into a pack.","short_description":"Whether you're competing in 24-hr races or sneaking in a ride after work, the Light & Motion Seca 1500 Race bike light is a superb light for cyclists that balances brightness, beam pattern and weight.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Accessories","product_group":"Bike Lights","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s375595.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l375595.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=375595&tt=df","keywords":"flashing","retail_price":"400.00","sale_price":"400.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=375595\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m375595.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=865081&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8650810001":{"sku":"8650810001","vendor_sku":"856-0492","upc":"812190015388","retail_price":"400.00","sale_price":"400.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-accessories","bike-lights"]}
