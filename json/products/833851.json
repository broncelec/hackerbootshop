{"sku":"833851","manufacturer_id":"06ILOR01A","brand_name":"Klymit","product_name":"Klymit Inertia X-Light Sleeping Pad","long_description":"Packs down smaller than a banana in your pocket, the Klymit Inertia X-Lite 3/4 length sleeping pad features a unique cut out design making it one of the lightest and most compact sleeping pads. Klymit uses body mapping to support the key areas, such as the head and hips, and removes padding in less critical areas to reduce weight. Cutouts preclude a sleeping bag's insulation from becoming compacted between your body and the sleeping pad, which allows the insulation to remain lofted for maximum warmth. Inertia X-Lite pad can be inflated with just 1 - 2 breaths; to adjust firmness, use the included hand pump to increase air pressure in pad. Use it under or inside (so you'll never fall off) your sleeping bag. Pad includes a stuff sack, patch kit and dry air pump. Folded up, pad can serve double duty as a backpanel/stay inside your frameless backpack. Constructed from 30-denier ripstop nylon top and a 75-denier polyester bottom for durability.","short_description":"Packs down smaller than a banana in your pocket, the Klymit Inertia X-Lite 3/4 length sleeping pad features a unique cut out design making it one of the lightest and most compact sleeping pads.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Pads, Cots And Hammocks","product_group":"Sleeping Pads","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s422179.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l422179.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=422179&tt=df","keywords":"mattress,mats","retail_price":"79.95","sale_price":"79.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=422179\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m422179.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=833851&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8338510001":{"sku":"8338510001","vendor_sku":"06ILOR01A","upc":"846647002133","size":"S","color":"ORANGE","retail_price":"79.95","sale_price":"79.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sleeping-pads-cots-and-hammocks","sleeping-pads"]}
