{"sku":"844498","manufacturer_id":"7035782","brand_name":"Giro","product_name":"Giro Air Attack Shield Bike Helmet","long_description":"With a removable eye shield and a sleek, compact design informed by wind-tunnel testing, the Giro Air Attack Shield bike helmet is a highly aerodynamic helmet for all-around road riding. Magnetically fastened polycarbonate eye shield is made by Zeiss optics and provides a clear, unobstructed field of view; lens has gray tint with silver flash. When shield isn't needed, it can be quickly removed, flipped upside down and reattached so it's facing up and out of the way. Strategic vent placement and shape of the helmet's interior help move cool air over your head while stale, hot air is vented out. Roc Loc Air retention system lets you literally dial in a comfortable fit with a small knob; system can also be adjusted up and down to find that \"just right\" fit. Lightweight, thin and adjustable webbing harness with a slim buckle gives you a low-profile, custom fit. Tough, lightweight outer shell is molded to the impact-absorbing expanded polystyrene liner to creating a light and strong helmet. Giro Air Attack Shield bike helmet has removable X-static(R) padding that helps wick sweat away from your head. Integrated silver fibers have natural antimicrobial properties to combat odors.","short_description":"With a removable eye shield and a sleek, compact design informed by wind-tunnel testing, the Giro Air Attack Shield bike helmet is a highly aerodynamic helmet for all-around road riding.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Helmets","product_group":"Recreational Cycling Helmets","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s383647.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l383647.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=383647&tt=df","retail_price":"240.00","sale_price":"240.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=383647\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m383647.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=844498&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8444980007":{"sku":"8444980007","vendor_sku":"2038959","upc":"768686893049","size":"S","color":"BLACK/RED","retail_price":"240.00","sale_price":"240.00"},"8444980013":{"sku":"8444980013","vendor_sku":"2038953","upc":"768686954962","size":"S","color":"BLUE/WHITE","retail_price":"240.00","sale_price":"240.00"},"8444980014":{"sku":"8444980014","vendor_sku":"2038953","upc":"768686954979","size":"M","color":"BLUE/WHITE","retail_price":"240.00","sale_price":"240.00"},"8444980016":{"sku":"8444980016","vendor_sku":"7035806","upc":"768686955327","size":"S","color":"MATTE BLACK","retail_price":"240.00","sale_price":"240.00"},"8444980022":{"sku":"8444980022","vendor_sku":"7035794","upc":"768686955204","size":"S","color":"HIGHLIGHT YELLOW/BLACK","retail_price":"240.00","sale_price":"240.00"},"8444980023":{"sku":"8444980023","vendor_sku":"7035795","upc":"768686955211","size":"M","color":"HIGHLIGHT YELLOW/BLACK","retail_price":"240.00","sale_price":"240.00"},"8444980024":{"sku":"8444980024","vendor_sku":"7035796","upc":"768686955228","size":"L","color":"HIGHLIGHT YELLOW/BLACK","retail_price":"240.00","sale_price":"240.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-helmets","recreational-cycling-helmets"]}
