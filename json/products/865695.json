{"sku":"865695","manufacturer_id":"CPD140INXL","brand_name":"Nemo","product_name":" NEMO Cosmo Insulated Air Sleeping Pad","long_description":"The NEMO Cosmo(TM) Insulated Air Sleeping Pad has a built-in foot pump for quick inflation plus 3 in. of thickness and a layer of PrimaLoft(R) for a warm night's sleep while backpacking. Pad features 3 in. baffled air chambers that evenly distribute weight; horizontal baffles create a flat sleeping surface and eliminate any bouncy feel. A layer of PrimaLoft(R) synthetic insulation inside the pad reduces heat loss to keep you warm on cold nights. Give your lungs a break and use the built-in foot pump at the end of the pad to inflate the pad quickly and easily. Dual valves provide maximum airflow for rapid inflation; valve on the underside opens for quick deflation. Pillow baffle at the head area supports your head and adds no weight to the pad. 75-denier polyester fabric resists puncture while keeping the weight down. NEMO Cosmo Insulated Air Sleeping Pad includes a stuff sack, compression strap and repair kit.","short_description":"The NEMO Cosmo(TM) Insulated Air Sleeping Pad has a built-in foot pump for quick inflation plus 3 in. of thickness and a layer of PrimaLoft(R) for a warm night's sleep while backpacking.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Pads, Cots And Hammocks","product_group":"Sleeping Pads","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s422275.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l422275.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=422275&tt=df","keywords":"mats,mattress","retail_price":"179.95","sale_price":"179.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=422275\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m422275.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=865695&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8656950001":{"sku":"8656950001","vendor_sku":"CPD140INRE","upc":"814041013321","size":"Regular","color":"DARK SKYBURST","retail_price":"139.95","sale_price":"139.95"},"8656950003":{"sku":"8656950003","vendor_sku":"CPD140INXL","upc":"814041013406","size":"XL","color":"DARK SKYBURST","retail_price":"179.95","sale_price":"179.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sleeping-pads-cots-and-hammocks","sleeping-pads"]}
