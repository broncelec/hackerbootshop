{"sku":"854701","manufacturer_id":"31127","brand_name":"Patagonia","product_name":"Patagonia Insulated Snowbelle Pants - Women's","long_description":"Staying dry is one thing, staying warm and dry is another. With the women's Patagonia Insulated Snowbelle pants, you get a waterproof and lightweight option that keeps you dry and cozy through winter. Rugged, 2-layer polyester shell is backed with a waterproof, breathable laminate to deliver all-weather protection, from late spring slush to snorkel-deep pow. 60g synthetic insulation (90% of which is recycled content) provides insulating warmth, even if it gets damp; plus, it compresses easily for compact stowing. Embedded RECCO(R) reflector enhances radio signals from search-and-rescue RECCO detectors, helping speed up the search for a buried avalanche victim. Polyester lining helps move sweat away from your body and glides smoothly over base layers; thigh vents let you release excess body heat for comfort. Brushed lining on waistband wicks sweat and provides against-the-skin comfort; zip-fly, 2-snap closure, and adjustable waistband tabs provide a personalized fit. Snow gaiters securely wrap around boots with gripper elastic to keep snow from entering pants; scuff guards protect cuffs from abrasion and sharp edges. Stash your gear in the zippered handwarmer pockets. Articulated knees allow unrestricted movement.","short_description":"Staying dry is one thing, staying warm and dry is another.
