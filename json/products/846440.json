{"sku":"846440","manufacturer_id":"010488-544-1-MD","brand_name":"Osprey","product_name":"Osprey Xenith 88 Pack","long_description":"Load up the Osprey Xenith 88 pack for your extended backpacking trip and enjoy its supportive and highly customizable fit, beefed up frame and deluxe suspension. Custom-moldable, anatomically contoured BioForm4 CM(TM) hipbelt and shoulder s balance firmness and cushioning for optimal support and comfort. Osprey certified custom molding is available in most REI stores-check your local store for a custom hipbelt molding oven. Back panel is lined with reversed spacer mesh for a smooth and breathable contact surface. Peripheral frame effectively transfers weight to the hipbelt; single 6061-T6 aluminum center stay helps maintain back panel shape. Top-loading main compartment can also be accessed through curved side zippers on each side of the pack body; wide-mouth sleeping bag compartment is easy to load and unload. Dual-compartment top pocket converts to lumbar pack with built-in belt. External hydration sleeve in the back panel simplifies refilling and helps protect pack contents from spills (hydration reservoir sold separately). Roomy front pockets with coated zippers help keep often-used items handy; stretch-mesh front pocket makes it easy to quickly stash and access extra gear. Zippered hipbelt pockets and dual-access stretch-mesh side pockets provide secure storage and organization. The Osprey Xenith 88 pack features dual side compression straps, removable sleeping pad straps, trekking pole attachment and 2 ice-axe loops and handle wraps.","short_description":"Load up the Osprey Xenith 88 pack for your extended backpacking trip and enjoy its supportive and highly customizable fit, beefed up frame and deluxe suspension.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Backpacks","product_group":"Backpacking Packs","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s410627.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l410627.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=410627&tt=df","keywords":"multiday","retail_price":"359.95","sale_price":"359.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=410627\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m410627.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=846440&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8464400001":{"sku":"8464400001","vendor_sku":"010488-544-1-MD","upc":"877257015282","size":"M","color":"GRAPHITE GRAY","retail_price":"359.95","sale_price":"359.95"},"8464400003":{"sku":"8464400003","vendor_sku":"010488-544-3-XL","upc":"877257015305","size":"XL","color":"GRAPHITE GRAY","retail_price":"359.95","sale_price":"359.95"},"8464400004":{"sku":"8464400004","vendor_sku":"010488-607-1-MD","upc":"877257015312","size":"M","color":"MEDITERRANEAN BLUE","retail_price":"359.95","sale_price":"359.95"},"8464400005":{"sku":"8464400005","vendor_sku":"010488-607-2-LG","upc":"877257015329","size":"L","color":"MEDITERRANEAN BLUE","retail_price":"359.95","sale_price":"359.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","backpacks","backpacking-packs"]}
