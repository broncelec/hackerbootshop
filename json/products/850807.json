{"sku":"850807","manufacturer_id":"S21615","brand_name":"Hydro Flask","product_name":"Hydro Flask Standard-Mouth Vacuum Bottle - 21 fl. oz.","long_description":"The 21 fl. oz. Hydro Flask Standard-Mouth vacuum bottle is ideal for keeping fluids hot or cold during weekend bike rides and hikes. Double-wall vacuum insulation keeps the contents hot for 12 hrs. and cold for 24 hrs. so you can warm up with cocoa or cool down with your favorite cold beverage. The inside temperature won't affect the outside temperature of the container-that means no burned fingers from hot beverages or condensation from ice-cold drinks. Standard-mouth opening is 1.81 in. in diameter, making it easy to fill the bottle with coffee, tea or sports drinks. Tough, food-grade 18/8 stainless steel is BPA free and resistant to bacteria and odors. Bottle fits in most car, bike and stroller cup holders and water bottle cages. Please note: Hydro Flask cannot guarantee against leaks when the bottle is filled with carbonated beverages; keep the bottle upright.","short_description":"The 21 fl. oz.
