{"sku":"859326","manufacturer_id":"S130303201189","brand_name":"K2","product_name":"K2 Shreditor 112 Skis - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"With a bidirectional sidecut that lets you ski backward or forward, the K2 Shreditor 112 freeride skis use rockered tips to float high in the deep stuff. Raised tips and tails float in powder, pop when doing tricks and deliver agile performance on all kinds of terrain; camber underfoot grips hardpack. With a tip that's just slightly wider than the tail, the bidirectional taper makes it easy to ski and land jumps backwards so you can jib all you want off backcountry features. Lightweight and tough fir and aspen wood core produces a natural flex, allowing the ski to achieve full contact with the snow throughout the turn. A fiberglass weave around the wood core provides torsional stiffness for highly responsive turning. The widest point of the tips is placed further back than on other K2 skis to reduce the tendency of skis to hook in light crust and throw you off balance. Use tip and tail holes to attach skins (sold separately); remove plugs with a flathead screwdriver. 112mm waist requires bindings with wide brakes. Base or topsheet color of the K2 Shreditor 112 skis may vary from online photo.","short_description":"With a bidirectional sidecut that lets you ski backward or forward, the K2 Shreditor 112 freeride skis use rockered tips to float high in the deep stuff.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382039.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382039.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382039&tt=df","retail_price":"649.95","sale_price":"389.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382039\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382039.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859326&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8593260001":{"sku":"8593260001","vendor_sku":"S130303201169","upc":"886745164333","size":"169 CM","retail_price":"389.93","sale_price":"389.93"},"8593260002":{"sku":"8593260002","vendor_sku":"S130303201179","upc":"886745164357","size":"179 CM","retail_price":"389.93","sale_price":"389.93"},"8593260003":{"sku":"8593260003","vendor_sku":"S130303201189","upc":"886745164371","size":"189 CM","retail_price":"389.93","sale_price":"389.93"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
