{"sku":"857669","manufacturer_id":"10548100001","brand_name":"Burton","product_name":"Burton Stiletto Snowboard Bindings - Women's - 2013/2014","long_description":"With an extra-flexy feel ready for all-mountain pursuits, the Burton Stiletto snowboard bindings for women give you the support and comfort needed to enjoy a day on the mountain. Women-specific True Fit(TM) Design creates boots and bindings specifically for the way a woman rides, ensuring complete control, total power and ultimate fun. Single-component, lightweight yet tough, composite baseplates provide moderate flex and consistent response for a versatile ride on all terrain. FullBED cushioning covers the entire baseplate to maximize comfort and minimize fatigue; extendable toe ramps reduce toe drag and increase responsiveness. Ergonomically-canted highbacks eliminate hardware to save weight; forward lean and highback rotation adjust independently of each other for a precise fit. Highbacks rotate side to side to follow the natural contours of your calves, optimizing power and comfort; forward lean adjusts quickly and easily without a tool. Lush ankle straps and premium toe straps lock you into the bindings; precurved and padded, they feature telescoping and multi-location adjustability. Primo capstrap toe straps feature a 3D, curved fit; built-in grip keeps straps in place. Smooth Glide(TM) buckles are strong and easy to grab for quick closure and release. Burton Stiletto bindings are compatible with traditional 3D(TM), 4x4 bolt patterns and The Channel.","short_description":"With an extra-flexy feel ready for all-mountain pursuits, the Burton Stiletto snowboard bindings for women give you the support and comfort needed to enjoy a day on the mountain.","category":"Snowboarding","subcategory":"Snowboard Bindings","product_group":"Strap Snowboard Bindings","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s383059.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l383059.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=383059&tt=df","retail_price":"159.95","sale_price":"111.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=383059\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m383059.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=857669&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8576690001":{"sku":"8576690001","vendor_sku":"10548100001","upc":"886888498425","size":"M","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"111.83","sale_price":"111.83"},"8576690002":{"sku":"8576690002","vendor_sku":"10548100001","upc":"886888498418","size":"L","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"111.83","sale_price":"111.83"}},"categories":["snow","snowboard-bindings","strap-snowboard-bindings"]}
