{"sku":"863095","manufacturer_id":"06413","brand_name":"Therm-A-Rest","product_name":" Therm-a-Rest NeoAir All-Season Sleeping Pad","long_description":"With its high insulating properties and 2.5 in. thickness, the Therm-a-Rest NeoAir(TM) All Season Sleeping Pad brings exceptional comfort and warmth to your year-round backcountry outings. Therm-a-Rest combines advanced, patent-pending technology and materials with decades of experience to offer a lightweight, warm and incredibly compressible sleeping pad. With double the insulating properties of the NeoAir Trekker, this pad incorporates a patent-pending Triangular Core Matrix(TM) technology for high warmth and low weight. The inovative baffling creates over 100 internal cells along with a reflective barrier that traps warm air and returns heat back to your body. Comes with the NeoAir(TM) Mini Pump that inflates the pad to the perfect level of comfort in about 3 min.; pump is powered by 2 AAA batteries (sold separately). Mini Pump weighs only 2.3 oz. and measures 2.75 x 1.7 in.; fits any NeoAir mattress valve. Thermal efficiency without added down or fiber insulation saves weight and allows the Therm-a-Rest NeoAir All Season Sleeping Pad to pack down small. R-value equals 4.9; most sleeping pads we sell range in R-value from 1.0 (minimally insulated) to 9.5 (well insulated). Supple, yet rugged 75-denier polyester fabric on top and a durable 70-denier nylon on the bottom provide a quiet sleep surface. Includes a stuff sack and a repair kit.","short_description":"With its high insulating properties and 2.5 in. thickness, the Therm-a-Rest NeoAir(TM) All Season Sleeping Pad brings exceptional comfort and warmth to your year-round backcountry outings.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Pads, Cots And Hammocks","product_group":"Sleeping Pads","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s422235.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l422235.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=422235&tt=df","keywords":"mats,mattress","retail_price":"179.95","sale_price":"179.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=422235\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m422235.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=863095&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8630950001":{"sku":"8630950001","vendor_sku":"06411","upc":"040818064115","size":"M","color":"LILYPAD","retail_price":"149.95","sale_price":"149.95"},"8630950002":{"sku":"8630950002","vendor_sku":"06412","upc":"040818064122","size":"Regular","color":"LILYPAD","retail_price":"159.95","sale_price":"159.95"},"8630950003":{"sku":"8630950003","vendor_sku":"06413","upc":"040818064139","size":"L","color":"LILYPAD","retail_price":"179.95","sale_price":"179.95"}}}
