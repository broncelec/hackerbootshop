ProDown(TM) is natural down insulation with a water-resistant finish that absorbs less water and dries faster than traditional down to keep you warm in wet conditions. With a 30degF temperature rating, the Gold Kazoo is suitable for 3-season backpacking trips. Anti-compression pads are body mapped to protect the areas where your body makes the most contact with the ground and to create an insulating buffer. Shaped hood helps retain warmth. Draft collar and zipper baffle prevent heat loss. Pad loops give you a way to attach the bag to a sleeping pad (pad not included). The North Face Gold Kazoo Sleeping Bag comes with a compression sack and storage sack.","short_description":"Weighing in around 2 lbs. and filled with water-resistant 650-fill down, The North Face Gold Kazoo Sleeping Bag will keep you warm down to 30degF, making it ideal for warm-weather backpacking.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags And Accessories","product_group":"Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s421667.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l421667.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=421667&tt=df","keywords":"compact","retail_price":"239.00","sale_price":"239.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=421667\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m421667.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=864545&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8645450001":{"sku":"8645450001","vendor_sku":"A1Q7M6N","upc":"715752282399","size":"Regular Right","color":"BRYCE ORANGE/ASPHALT GREY","retail_price":"229.00","sale_price":"229.00"},"8645450002":{"sku":"8645450002","vendor_sku":"A1Q7M6N","upc":"715752282405","size":"Long Right","color":"BRYCE ORANGE/ASPHALT GREY","retail_price":"239.00","sale_price":"239.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sleeping-bags-and-accessories","sleeping-bags"]}
