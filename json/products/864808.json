{"sku":"864808","manufacturer_id":"13633","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":"REI Quarter Dome T2 Tent - Special Buy","long_description":"The REI Quarter Dome T2 Tent uses an innovative design to keep weight low, maximize volume and bolster stability so you can sleep soundly during spring, summer and fall backcountry adventures. Freestanding 2-person tent features 2 side vestibules, 2 doors and 2 vents for maximum space, access and storage. Rectangular floor plan makes it easy to arrange sleeping bags and gear and allows efficient use of space. Advanced frame design maximizes headroom, interior volume and strength; pole clips provide quick and easy tent setup. Lightweight materials and DAC NSL hubbed poleset provide high interior volume and low overall weight. Windproof, breathable perimeter fabric blocks dust and sand from blowing in under the fly; bathtub floor with seam-sealed corners ensures complete waterproof protection. Dry Entry vestibule offers convenient access and ample storage capacity. Fully adjustable, high-level vents mitigate condensation, drawing cool air under the fly from the lower perimeter and exhausting warm, moist air. Silicone-treated, lightweight ripstop nylon fly stays taut in the rain while keeping you dry. The REI Quarterdome T2 tent offers multiple interior storage options with mesh side pockets and hang loops located throughout. Includes tapered, easy-to-stuff compression stuff sack, 6 stakes, 4 guylines and tighteners, pole repair tube, and pole and stake bags. Fly/footprint minimalist pitch option allows the fly, poles and footprint (sold separately) to be combined into a lightweight shelter without the tent itself. Special buy.","short_description":"The REI Quarter Dome T2 Tent uses an innovative design to keep weight low, maximize volume and bolster stability so you can sleep soundly during spring, summer and fall backcountry adventures.","category":"Camping & Hiking","subcategory":"Tents","product_group":"Backpacking Tents","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s357459.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l357459.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=357459&tt=df","keywords":"backpacking,tent,summergear","retail_price":"299.00","sale_price":"229.73","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=357459\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m357459.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=864808&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8648080001":{"sku":"8648080001","vendor_sku":"13633","upc":"486480800017","color":"LICHEN/PLATINUM","retail_price":"229.73","sale_price":"229.73"}}}
