{"sku":"862175","manufacturer_id":"CM21636101","brand_name":"Cannondale","product_name":"Cannondale Synapse Alloy 7 Bike - 2014","long_description":"Built for comfort during long rides, the Cannondale Synapse Alloy 7 road bike features a versatile 27-speed drivetrain and Shimano Sora components for value and dependability. Synapse aluminum frame is built to give riders enhanced handling, stability and steering precision in a more comfortable, upright position than race-oriented road frames. Rear part of the frame and the carbon-bladed fork feature the Cannondale Synapse Active Vibration Elimination (S.A.V.E.) technology for damping road vibration. Shimano Sora shifters and derailleurs offer responsive shifting across the 27 gear combinations. FSA Vero triple crankset and a wide-ranging 12-28 tooth cassette combine for a wide range of gears, meaning you'll be spinning easy up hills and cruising swiftly on descents. Schwalbe Lugano tires supply low rolling resistance and grippy handling. Specs on the Cannondale Synapse Alloy 7 road bike are subject to change.","short_description":"Built for comfort during long rides, the Cannondale Synapse Alloy 7 road bike features a versatile 27-speed drivetrain and Shimano Sora components for value and dependability.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bikes","product_group":"Road Bikes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s374651.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l374651.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=374651&tt=df","retail_price":"949.00","sale_price":"949.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=374651\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m374651.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=862175&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8621750004":{"sku":"8621750004","vendor_sku":"CM21635801","upc":"884603507896","size":"58 CM","color":"MAGNESIUM WHITE GLOSS","retail_price":"949.00","sale_price":"949.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bikes","road-bikes"]}
