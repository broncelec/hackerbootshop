{"sku":"875430","manufacturer_id":"W010-0522","brand_name":"Wtb","product_name":"WTB Trail Boss 29er Comp Tire - 29 x 2.25","long_description":"Go out and dominate any trail on the WTB Trail Boss 29er Comp Tire, a performance-oriented 29er tire dedicated to cross-country and all-mountain rides. Tread is tightly spaced for high speed, drag-free onslaughts, yet blocky and tall enough to really dig in when it comes time to slam on the brakes. A rounded profile and staggered, supported side knobs keep clamoring for traction even as the trail becomes smooth. Relatively tight tread spacing provides an excellent plane for riding harder surfaces, creating a smooth-rolling sensation. Siping on center blocks as well as corner blocks create more working edges, and as tires undergo braking and cornering additional bands of grip are exposed to enhance traction. The cornering side blocks are offset from each other to create consistency and a predictable feel when transitioning from outer tread to inner tread. A robust casing provides the strength needed for wire bead tires to last, and a high ratio of rubber to thread protects against trail threats and urban unpleasantries. Proprietary 60a durometer rubber compound offers the ideal mix of rolling efficiency and traction for cross-country and trail riding; plus, it's versatile and long lasting.","short_description":"Go out and dominate any trail on the WTB Trail Boss 29er Comp Tire, a performance-oriented 29er tire dedicated to cross-country and all-mountain rides.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Components","product_group":"Bike Tires, Tubes And Wheels","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s460007.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l460007.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=460007&tt=df","retail_price":"39.00","sale_price":"39.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=460007\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m460007.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=875430&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8754300001":{"sku":"8754300001","vendor_sku":"W010-0522","upc":"714401105225","size":"29 IN X 2.25 IN","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"39.00","sale_price":"39.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-components","bike-tires-tubes-and-wheels"]}
