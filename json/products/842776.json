{"sku":"842776","manufacturer_id":"S121201001167","brand_name":"K2","product_name":"K2 Trim-To-Fit Skins","long_description":"These K2 Trim-To-Fit climbing skins are designed specifically for K2 BackSide-series skis (sold separately) and feature an innovative attachment system to reduce weight and friction. Improved for 2012/2013, the minamalist design of the Z-Clip tip attachments keeps weight low and helps prevent snow from building up where the skins meet the skis. Z-Clip attachments easily hook onto the holes at the tips of K2 skis. Adjustable tail straps interface with the tail holes on K2 skis to secure the skins; clips sit on top of the skis rather than at the back to reduce drag. Initial width is 125mm, but can be trimmed to match the sidecut of your K2 skis using the included offset skin cutter tool; offset tool makes trimming a quick exercise. Choose the length that matches your ski length. Trim-To-Fit skins are designed for K2 skis with tip and tail attachment holes. K2 Trim-To-Fit climbing skins include Glue Saver mesh storage sheets, skin trimming tool, detailed instructions and a nylon storage bag.","short_description":"These K2 Trim-To-Fit climbing skins are designed specifically for K2 BackSide-series skis (sold separately) and feature an innovative attachment system to reduce weight and friction.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Climbing Skins","product_group":"Ski Skins","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s408343.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l408343.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=408343&tt=df","retail_price":"199.95","sale_price":"159.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=408343\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m408343.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=842776&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8427760001":{"sku":"8427760001","vendor_sku":"S121201001153","upc":"886745041696","size":"153 CM","color":"GREEN","retail_price":"159.93","sale_price":"159.93"},"8427760002":{"sku":"8427760002","vendor_sku":"S121201001160","upc":"886745041702","size":"160 CM","color":"GREEN","retail_price":"159.93","sale_price":"159.93"},"8427760003":{"sku":"8427760003","vendor_sku":"S121201001167","upc":"886745041719","size":"167 CM","color":"GREEN","retail_price":"159.93","sale_price":"159.93"},"8427760004":{"sku":"8427760004","vendor_sku":"S121201001174","upc":"886745041726","size":"174 CM","color":"GREEN","retail_price":"159.93","sale_price":"159.93"},"8427760005":{"sku":"8427760005","vendor_sku":"S121201001181","upc":"886745041733","size":"181 CM","color":"GREEN","retail_price":"159.93","sale_price":"159.93"}},"categories":["snow","climbing-skins","ski-skins"]}
