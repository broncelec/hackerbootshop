ProDown(TM) is natural down insulation with a water-resistant finish that absorbs less water and dries faster than traditional down to keep you warm in cold, wet conditions. With a 0degF temperature rating, the Green Kazoo is suitable for 4-season use. Anti-compression pads are body mapped to protect the areas where your body makes the most contact with the ground and to create an insulating buffer. Shaped hood helps retain warmth. Draft collar and zipper baffle prevent heat loss. Pad loops give you a way to attach the bag to a sleeping pad (pad not included). The North Face Green Kazoo Sleeping Bag comes with a compression sack and storage sack.","short_description":"Efficiently designed to deliver reliable warmth in 0degF weather, the Green Kazoo Sleeping Bag from The North Face is crafted with water-resistant 650-fill down for comfort year-round.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags And Accessories","product_group":"Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s421679.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l421679.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=421679&tt=df","keywords":"compact","retail_price":"349.00","sale_price":"349.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=421679\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m421679.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=864548&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8645480001":{"sku":"8645480001","vendor_sku":"A1Q3D3Y","upc":"715752273816","size":"Regular Left","color":"FLASHLIGHT GREEN/ASPHALT","retail_price":"339.00","sale_price":"339.00"},"8645480002":{"sku":"8645480002","vendor_sku":"A1Q3D3Y","upc":"715752273830","size":"Long Left","color":"FLASHLIGHT GREEN/ASPHALT","retail_price":"349.00","sale_price":"349.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sleeping-bags-and-accessories","sleeping-bags"]}
