{"sku":"839669","manufacturer_id":"51006206BL","brand_name":"Time","product_name":"Time I-Clic2 Road Cleats","long_description":"These Time I-Clic2 replacement road cleats work with the I-Clic2 pedals and feature nonslip contact points for good off-bike traction when walking to the cafe. One-piece cleat design has three integrated nonslip contact points that offer good traction and stability when you're not clipped in. As an added bonus, if the cleat's nonslip contact points wear down, pedal entry/exit performance won't be compromised since they are not part of the engagement system. These cleats fit shoes with the traditional 3-bolt mounting pattern; mounting hardware included. Please note: these Time I-Clic2 cleats are not compatible with Time RXS, RXE, Impact or older Time pedals; they are only compatible with I-Clic2 pedals.","short_description":"These Time I-Clic2 replacement road cleats work with the I-Clic2 pedals and feature nonslip contact points for good off-bike traction when walking to the cafe.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Cycling Shoes","product_group":"Cycling Shoe Cleats","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s454319.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l454319.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=454319&tt=df","retail_price":"25.00","sale_price":"25.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=454319\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m454319.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=839669&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8396690001":{"sku":"8396690001","vendor_sku":"51006206BL","upc":"888145010234","retail_price":"25.00","sale_price":"25.00"}},"categories":["cycling","cycling-shoes","cycling-shoe-cleats"]}
