{"sku":"844009","manufacturer_id":"262201","brand_name":"Black Diamond","product_name":" Black Diamond Camalot X4 Cams","long_description":"Combining single-stem flexibility for horizontal crack placements with a narrow head width that fits in tight places, the Black Diamond Camalot X4 cam is the missing link on your trad rack. X4 features 4 cam lobes for excellent expansion range and holding power, yet it maintains a narrow width so it can fit where other cams won't, such as in old piton scars. Narrow head width is created by embedding the cam springs within the cam lobes. Stacked axle design of the smallest three sizes gives the cams more expansion range per size than any other small four-cam unit available. Largest three sizes use the tried-and-true Black Diamond double axle design that's found in the original Camalot. Six sizes of the X4 cover the same expansion range as eight sizes of comparable cam units, meaning you can carry fewer cams yet protect the same size cracks. Aluminum beads protect the woven cable from abrasion without compromising the flexibility of the stem, allowing the cam to hold strong in awkward horizontal placements. Trigger bar is hot forged to fit comfortably in your hand and make cam placement quick and easy. Lightweight, durable Dyneema slings help you identify the cam you want when you're grabbing one; Dyneema slings visually set the cams apart from others on your rack. Color-coded Oz and Neutrino carabiner Rackpacks are sold separately, offering a great way to rack the Black Diamond Camalot X4 cams for easy identification.","short_description":"Combining single-stem flexibility for horizontal crack placements with a narrow head width that fits in tight places, the Black Diamond Camalot X4 cam is the missing link on your trad rack.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Protection","product_group":"Cams","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s407123.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l407123.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=407123&tt=df","retail_price":"69.95","sale_price":"69.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=407123\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m407123.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=844009&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8440090001":{"sku":"8440090001","vendor_sku":"262201","upc":"793661175629","size":"Size 0.1","color":"RED","retail_price":"69.95","sale_price":"69.95"},"8440090003":{"sku":"8440090003","vendor_sku":"262201","upc":"793661175643","size":"Size 0.3","color":"BLUE","retail_price":"69.95","sale_price":"69.95"},"8440090004":{"sku":"8440090004","vendor_sku":"262201","upc":"793661175650","size":"Size 0.4","color":"GRAY","retail_price":"69.95","sale_price":"69.95"},"8440090005":{"sku":"8440090005","vendor_sku":"262201","upc":"793661175667","size":"Size 0.5","color":"PURPLE","retail_price":"69.95","sale_price":"69.95"},"8440090006":{"sku":"8440090006","vendor_sku":"262201","upc":"793661176275","size":"Size 0.75","color":"GREEN","retail_price":"69.95","sale_price":"69.95"}}}
