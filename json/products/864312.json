{"sku":"864312","manufacturer_id":"FNPPGYMC","brand_name":"Smith","product_name":" Smith Frontman Polarized Sunglasses - Men's","long_description":"The Smith Frontman polarized sunglasses put you front and center with charisma and crisp, fresh details. A curved design and thick temples block out the sun (or camera flashes from your adoring fans). Polarized lenses reduce 99% of visible glare for increased sharpness and decreased eye fatigue. Lightweight and virtually shatterproof, injection-molded polycarbonate lenses are twenty times more impact resistant than glass and one-third the weight. Matte Black frames feature gray-tint lenses, ideal for bright days and direct sunlight. Brown Stripe frames feature brown-tint lenses that enhance your vision in a wide range of light and weather conditions. Hydrophilic Megol nosepiece and temple ends become tackier when wet for reliable grip during exercise and hot weather. 53% bio-based Evolve frames are made with Rilsan(R) Clear, a light, durable, non-petroleum-based material derived from renewable, non-GMO castor plants.","short_description":"The Smith Frontman polarized sunglasses put you front and center with charisma and crisp, fresh details.
