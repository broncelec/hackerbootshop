Antidote(TM) reservoir features a welded center baffle and a low-profile shape for stability. Quick Link(TM) system lets you effortlessly add accessories such as a Fresh(TM) filter, insulated tube, tube director, flow meter or hanger (accessories sold separately). Hydration compartment loads easily, holding the reservoir flat against your back to leave more room for layers and gear. Wide-mouth port cuts weight and makes it easy to fill and clean the reservoir; quick-snap cap tightens in just a quarter turn. Folding arms lock into position to hold the reservoir open when drying; arms tuck out of the way around the port when not in use. Short torso length and S-curve harness align with the shape of a woman's body, and the Air Director(TM) back panel helps ensure a comfortable, stable fit. Sternum strap is placed high for a women-specific fit; 1 in. webbing hipbelt is removable. The CamelBak Helena 22 Hydration Pack has an essentials pocket to organize small gear; tool loop and lash point let you attach poles or an ice axe to the exterior of the pack.","short_description":"The women's CamelBak Helena 22 Hydration Pack offers 100 fl. oz. of liquid capacity, plenty of gear storage and maximum comfort for hours of outdoor adventure.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Backpacks","product_group":"Day Packs","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s411559.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l411559.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=411559&tt=df","retail_price":"100.00","sale_price":"100.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=411559\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m411559.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=867423&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8674230001":{"sku":"8674230001","vendor_sku":"62193","upc":"886798621937","size":"100 FL OZ","color":"MYKONOS BLUE/BLUE JEWEL","retail_price":"100.00","sale_price":"100.00"},"8674230002":{"sku":"8674230002","vendor_sku":"62195","upc":"886798621951","size":"100 FL OZ","color":"MIRAGE GRAY/IMPERIAL PURP","retail_price":"100.00","sale_price":"100.00"},"8674230003":{"sku":"8674230003","vendor_sku":"62194","upc":"886798621944","size":"100 FL OZ","color":"IMPERIAL PURPLE/PURPLE","retail_price":"100.00","sale_price":"100.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","backpacks","day-packs"]}
