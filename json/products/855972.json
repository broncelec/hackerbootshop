{"sku":"855972","manufacturer_id":"10105100","brand_name":"Burton","product_name":" Burton Indulgence Shell Pants - Women's","long_description":"The women's windproof, waterproof Burton Indulgence shell pants have a slim fit like your favorite low-rider jeans, yet are built to mirror your every move with stretch fabric for excellent comfort. Fully seam-taped, DRYRIDE Durashell(TM) 2-layer coated polyester pants deliver reliable protection in any weather; mesh lining manages interior moisture. Mesh-lined inner thigh vents keep you dry and comfortable whether you're hiking the pipe or riding the lift. Zippered, fleece-lined hand pockets keep fingers warm; zippered rear pockets give you a place to stow essentials. Internal waist adjustment tabs personalize the fit; they're low profile to maximize comfort. Soft microfleece fly and waistband lining let you ride with your shirt untucked with no worries about pinching or chafing; antimicrobial finish helps keep odors at bay. Stretch gaiters with lace hooks help prevent snow from getting into boots, even in deep powder. Zippers in hems make getting your boots on and off easy, and add a relaxed look and feel. Snap-up leg lifts let you raise and secure pant cuffs, protecting the pants from parking lot carnage. Special interface connects pants to compatible Burton jackets (sold separately) to ensure snow stays outside. O-ring at the waist gives you a place to hang your lift ticket. Articulated Burton Indulgence shell pants have a slim fit that's tighter all around without limiting mobility thanks to stretch materials.","short_description":"The women's windproof, waterproof Burton Indulgence shell pants have a slim fit like your favorite low-rider jeans, yet are built to mirror your every move with stretch fabric for excellent comfort.","category":"Women's Clothing","subcategory":"Women's Pants","product_group":"Women's Snow Pants","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s395555.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l395555.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=395555&tt=df","keywords":"hardshell","retail_price":"155.00","sale_price":"107.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=395555\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m395555.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=855972&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8559720001":{"sku":"8559720001","vendor_sku":"10105100","upc":"886888453257","size":"XS","color":"FOXFIRE","retail_price":"107.83","sale_price":"107.83"},"8559720002":{"sku":"8559720002","vendor_sku":"10105100","upc":"886888453233","size":"S","color":"FOXFIRE","retail_price":"107.83","sale_price":"107.83"},"8559720004":{"sku":"8559720004","vendor_sku":"10105100","upc":"886888453219","size":"L","color":"FOXFIRE","retail_price":"107.83","sale_price":"107.83"},"8559720005":{"sku":"8559720005","vendor_sku":"10105100","upc":"886888453240","size":"XL","color":"FOXFIRE","retail_price":"107.83","sale_price":"107.83"},"8559720006":{"sku":"8559720006","vendor_sku":"10105100","upc":"886888453059","size":"XS","color":"BURNT OLIVE","retail_price":"107.83","sale_price":"107.83"},"8559720010":{"sku":"8559720010","vendor_sku":"10105100","upc":"886888453042","size":"XL","color":"BURNT OLIVE","retail_price":"107.83","sale_price":"107.83"}}}
