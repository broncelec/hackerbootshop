{"sku":"863655","manufacturer_id":"11109","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":"REI Lite-Core 1.5 Self-Inflating Pad - Special Buy","long_description":"Travel light and sleep comfortably-weighing less than 2 pounds, the ultracompact REI Lite-Core 1.5 Self-Inflating Pad takes up precious little space in your backpack. X-Core foam insulation is cross-cored for maximum compressibility and weight reduction. Quick-closing, high-volume-airflow valve allows the pad to inflate and deflate quickly. Rugged Taslan(R) nylon diamond-ripstop top surface has a nonslip texture; 75-denier polyester bottom surface resists wear. Grippy silicone pattern on top surface helps keep sleeping bag from sliding off pad. Low-volume, tapered, mummy-shape design increases efficiency and compressibility. R-value equals 3.2; most sleeping pads we sell range in R-value from 1.0 (minimally insulated) to 9.5 (well insulated). The REI Lite-Core 1.5 Self-Inflating Pad includes a stuff sack to protect pad during transport and ensure a compact parcel every time. Special buy.","short_description":"Travel light and sleep comfortably-weighing less than 2 pounds, the ultracompact REI Lite-Core 1.5 Self-Inflating Pad takes up precious little space in your backpack.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Pads, Cots And Hammocks","product_group":"Sleeping Pads","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s454047.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l454047.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=454047&tt=df","keywords":"mattress,mats","retail_price":"99.50","sale_price":"69.73","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=454047\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m454047.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=863655&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8636550001":{"sku":"8636550001","vendor_sku":"11109","upc":"486365500018","size":"Regular","color":"MONARCH ORANGE","retail_price":"69.73","sale_price":"69.73"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sleeping-pads-cots-and-hammocks","sleeping-pads"]}
