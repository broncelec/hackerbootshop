{"sku":"849223","manufacturer_id":"EVL0082","brand_name":"Evolv","product_name":"evolv Shaman Rock Shoes","long_description":"Developed from the ground up by Chris Sharma, the evolv Shaman rock shoes incorporate an aggressive downturned shape and high-quality materials to meet your needs on steep routes. Downturned shape features a roomy toe box to allow your big toes to stay bent in a position of power while you're climbing. Toe rands of varying thicknesses enhance durability in high-wear zones, such as the front of the toe, without being cumbersome. High-performance, 4.2mm TRAX XT-5 high-friction rubber soles stick tenaciously to rock. 3 rip-and-stick straps draw the arches of the shoes into your feet for an excellent fit. Flexible and durable synthetic suede uppers resist stretching and dry quickly. Full-length MX-P 1.5mm midsoles have medium stiffness for edging power on long face routes yet are flexible enough for smearing. Microfiber lining in the forefeet, cotton in the heels and leather on the footbeds limit stretching and offer great comfort. The evolv Shaman rock shoes are part of the Chris Sharma Signature Series.","short_description":"Developed from the ground up by Chris Sharma, the evolv Shaman rock shoes incorporate an aggressive downturned shape and high-quality materials to meet your needs on steep routes.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Shoes","product_group":"Men's Climbing Shoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s407219.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l407219.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=407219&tt=df","retail_price":"150.00","sale_price":"150.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=407219\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m407219.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=849223&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8492230003":{"sku":"8492230003","vendor_sku":"EVL0082","upc":"877565009614","size":"7","color":"ORANGE/BLUE","retail_price":"150.00","sale_price":"150.00"},"8492230004":{"sku":"8492230004","vendor_sku":"EVL0082","upc":"877565009621","size":"7.5","color":"ORANGE/BLUE","retail_price":"150.00","sale_price":"150.00"},"8492230005":{"sku":"8492230005","vendor_sku":"EVL0082","upc":"877565009638","size":"8","color":"ORANGE/BLUE","retail_price":"150.00","sale_price":"150.00"},"8492230006":{"sku":"8492230006","vendor_sku":"EVL0082","upc":"877565009645","size":"8.5","color":"ORANGE/BLUE","retail_price":"150.00","sale_price":"150.00"},"8492230008":{"sku":"8492230008","vendor_sku":"EVL0082","upc":"877565009669","size":"9.5","color":"ORANGE/BLUE","retail_price":"150.00","sale_price":"150.00"},"8492230015":{"sku":"8492230015","vendor_sku":"EVL0082","upc":"877565009737","size":"13","color":"ORANGE/BLUE","retail_price":"150.00","sale_price":"150.00"}},"categories":["climbing","climbing-shoes","mens-climbing-shoes"]}
