Rugged synthetic leather uppers offer a comfortable, flexible fit with a women-specific shape. Nonslip laces allow you to personalize the fit, hidden lace holders keep them from getting in the way. Molded EVA footbeds with medium arch support discourage arch fatigue and enhance comfort. Internal shanks provide good pedaling stiffness and flex for comfort while walking. Lugged outsoles provide sure traction when you're traipsing about off the bike. Giro Petra mountain bike shoes can be used on flat pedals or with 2-bolt clipless cleats/pedals; please note that cleats are not included (cleats typically come with pedals).","short_description":"The Giro Petra mountain bike shoes provide equal comfort and performance on and off your bike, whether riding trails or exploring the vistas you've worked hard to reach.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Cycling Shoes","product_group":"Mountain Bike Shoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s380367.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l380367.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=380367&tt=df","retail_price":"80.00","sale_price":"80.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=380367\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m380367.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=847239&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{},"extended_xml_attributes":"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t","categories":["cycling","cycling-shoes","mountain-bike-shoes"]}
