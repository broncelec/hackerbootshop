{"sku":"875584","manufacturer_id":"F1700284","brand_name":"Fizik","product_name":" Fizik Antares Versus X K:ium Saddle - Men's","long_description":"Lightly padded with a deep center channel for comfort, the 240g Fizik Antares Versus X K:ium Bike Saddle offers a high-performance saddle to cyclists having a moderate range of flexibility. Antares Versus X K:ium is designed to offer support for those with moderate flexibility-when bent over, one's hands hang midway down shins, not touching toes. Synthetic Microtex cover is durable, water resistant and washable, and will not fade; plus, it's lighter than leather. Central channel spans the length of the saddle to offer a relief zone for sensitive tissues. Double-injected foam offers light padding for long days in the saddle. Nylon/carbon-reinforced shell provides lightweight support and comfort. K:ium alloy rails offer an excellent strength-to-weight ratio and comfort-enhancing vibration damping.","short_description":"Lightly padded with a deep center channel for comfort, the 240g Fizik Antares Versus X K:ium Bike Saddle offers a high-performance saddle to cyclists having a moderate range of flexibility.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Components","product_group":"Bike Saddles And Seatposts","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s456487.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l456487.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=456487&tt=df","retail_price":"199.00","sale_price":"199.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=456487\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m456487.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=875584&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8755840001":{"sku":"8755840001","vendor_sku":"F1700284","color":"BLACK/RED","retail_price":"199.00","sale_price":"199.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-components","bike-saddles-and-seatposts"]}
