{"sku":"857738","manufacturer_id":"R1304003016","brand_name":"Ride","product_name":"Ride Capo Snowboard Bindings - 2013/2014","long_description":"Built for tearing up the park and mountain alike, Ride Capo snowboard bindings offer comfortable straps that lock in your feet and adjustable heel cups that dial in the fit. Lightweight, flexible chassis are built with the ambitious rider in mind, offering superior stability and finely tunable adjustments; heel cups are adjustable. Built to excel in freestyle riding, Eclipse highbacks are highly responsive with just the right amount of support and control. Padded freestyle ankle straps excel at freestyle charging; tool-less adjustment makes dialing down the fit a cinch. Wedgie(TM) 2.5 footbeds use subtle angles to align ankles and knees for extra leverage and pop in the park. Convertible ThinGrip toe straps can be worn across the top or over the front of boots to hold you in tight; you can change positions on the fly. Injected urethane material provides extra damping and shock absorption during high-impact riding, so you can stay out longer in the park. AstroGlyde LT ratchets deliver super-smooth cranking power and a buttery release. Ride Capo bindings are compatible with the Burton The Channel system; disc conversion kit sold separately.","short_description":"Built for tearing up the park and mountain alike, Ride Capo snowboard bindings offer comfortable straps that lock in your feet and adjustable heel cups that dial in the fit.","category":"Snowboarding","subcategory":"Snowboard Bindings","product_group":"Strap Snowboard Bindings","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s461547.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l461547.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=461547&tt=df","retail_price":"269.95","sale_price":"215.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=461547\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m461547.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=857738&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8577380003":{"sku":"8577380003","vendor_sku":"R1304003034","upc":"886745150275","size":"M","color":"ORANGE","retail_price":"187.83","sale_price":"187.83"},"8577380004":{"sku":"8577380004","vendor_sku":"R1304003036","upc":"886745150282","size":"L","color":"ORANGE","retail_price":"187.83","sale_price":"187.83"},"8577380005":{"sku":"8577380005","vendor_sku":"R1304003018","upc":"886745150237","size":"XL","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"215.93","sale_price":"215.93"}},"categories":["snow","snowboard-bindings","strap-snowboard-bindings"]}
