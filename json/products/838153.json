{"sku":"838153","manufacturer_id":"325805","brand_name":"Salomon","product_name":" Salomon Pearl Boa Snowboard Boots - Women's - 2012/2013","long_description":"The Salomon Pearl Boa snowboard boots go on easy and offer a fast, secure and easy-to-use Boa(R) lacing sytem for a perfect fit. Boa(R) Coiler lacing system, with ankle and cable guides along entire edge of eyestays, distributes closure force evenly for a dialed-in fit that won't loosen up. The Coiler scoops up loose cable when entering as well as exiting the boot; put your foot in, pull back on the tongue, twist the reel a few times and you're off. Thermal-formable Feel Good liners conform to feet after several days of riding, and are crafted with a wide range of foams to fit specific flex zones on feet and ankles. Preshaped footbeds provide foot stabilization and arch support for improved pressure distribution; antimicrobial finish helps keep odors at bay. Liner lacing system is a quick, 1-pull tightener that won't burn your fingers; it provides a supportive, personalized fit with natural flex and feel. Salomon Pearl Boa boots with stomp outsoles protect you on bomb drops and unexpected cement landings; plus, they offer good board feel and response.","short_description":"The Salomon Pearl Boa snowboard boots go on easy and offer a fast, secure and easy-to-use Boa(R) lacing sytem for a perfect fit.","category":"Snowboarding","subcategory":"Snowboard Boots","product_group":"Women's Snowboard Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s450647.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l450647.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=450647&tt=df","retail_price":"189.95","sale_price":"94.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=450647\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m450647.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=838153&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8381530009":{"sku":"8381530009","vendor_sku":"325805","upc":"080694055128","size":"27 EU","color":"BLACK/LT RUBIS RED/BLACK","retail_price":"94.83","sale_price":"94.83"}},"categories":["snow","snowboard-boots","womens-snowboard-boots"]}
