{"sku":"861908","manufacturer_id":"RV174","brand_name":"Skilogik","product_name":" SKILOGIK Rave RL Skis - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Built for versatility from the steep to the deep, the men's SKILOGIK Rave RL skis combine a beautifully-crafted wood veneer and easy-to-turn rockered tips. Rockered tips are easy to maneuver and offer excellent flotation in soft snow, and the relatively tight sidecut radius offers the versatility to carve groomers. Construction consists of a hardwood core layered in a composite of carbon and fiberglass, topped with an eye-pleasing wood veneer that speaks to deep craftsmanship. Complementary wood cores ensure that your left ski and right ski have a matched flex pattern. Black locust hardwood sidewalls offer extra grip. 92mm waists require bindings with wide brakes. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.","short_description":"Built for versatility from the steep to the deep, the men's SKILOGIK Rave RL skis combine a beautifully-crafted wood veneer and easy-to-turn rockered tips.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382347.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382347.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382347&tt=df","retail_price":"750.00","sale_price":"599.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382347\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382347.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=861908&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8619080002":{"sku":"8619080002","vendor_sku":"RV182","upc":"486190800024","size":"182 CM","color":"DARK/LIGHT BROWN/YELLOW/G","retail_price":"599.93","sale_price":"599.93"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
