{"sku":"862274","manufacturer_id":"57692FK41.0","brand_name":"Pearl Izumi","product_name":"Pearl Izumi SELECT Mountain Bike Shoes - Men's - 2009 Closeout","long_description":"The Pearl Izumi SELECT mountain bike shoes combine lightweight construction and aggressive rubber tread for performance on all trails, especially the muddy ones. Thick rubber treads provide reliable traction when you're off the bike, but shed the mud when you're back on the pedals. Synthetic leather and nylon mesh uppers are breathable and durable; low-cut ankles reduce overall weight. 3 rip-and-stick closure straps are angled 15deg from traditional strap placement to follow a more anatomic curve, easing instep pressure and ensuring a secure fit. EVA footbeds provide comfortable cushioning and lasting arch support. Stiff nylon and composite fiber plate ensures efficient power transfer; Direct-Vent system enhaces breathability on warm days and drainage on wet ones. Low profile, concave shape of footbed and plate cradles the foot for support, comfort and pedaling efficiency. Pearl Izumi SELECT mountain bike shoes are compatible with SPD, Time, Look, Speedplay and Crank Brothers cleats. Please note: cleats are not included.
