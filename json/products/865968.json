{"sku":"865968","manufacturer_id":"700330003","brand_name":"Scarpa","product_name":"Scarpa Instinct Lace Rock Shoes","long_description":"The Scarpa Instinct Lace Climbing Shoes are great all-arounders, and feature a down-turned design that allows purchase on holds that are otherwise nonexistent. Suede uppers in a lace-up design mold to your feet, offering control and support for routes that demand precision and edging power. Bi-tension randing, which actively pulls power from the toes rather than cramming your toes painfully forward, gives performance with less tension. Vibram(R) XS Edge rubber melds excellent grip with good durability and edge hold. The Scarpa Instinct Lace Climbing Shoes have rubber patches on the tops of the toes that provide grip when you're crack climbing.","short_description":"The Scarpa Instinct Lace Climbing Shoes are great all-arounders, and feature a down-turned design that allows purchase on holds that are otherwise nonexistent.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Shoes","product_group":"Men's Climbing Shoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s407243.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l407243.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=407243&tt=df","retail_price":"145.00","sale_price":"145.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=407243\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m407243.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=865968&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8659680011":{"sku":"8659680011","vendor_sku":"700330003","upc":"666898365180","size":"39 EU","color":"PARROT","retail_price":"145.00","sale_price":"145.00"},"8659680012":{"sku":"8659680012","vendor_sku":"700330003","upc":"666898365197","size":"39.5 EU","color":"PARROT","retail_price":"145.00","sale_price":"145.00"},"8659680013":{"sku":"8659680013","vendor_sku":"700330003","upc":"666898365203","size":"40 EU","color":"PARROT","retail_price":"145.00","sale_price":"145.00"},"8659680015":{"sku":"8659680015","vendor_sku":"700330003","upc":"666898365227","size":"41 EU","color":"PARROT","retail_price":"145.00","sale_price":"145.00"},"8659680016":{"sku":"8659680016","vendor_sku":"700330003","upc":"666898365234","size":"41.5 EU","color":"PARROT","retail_price":"145.00","sale_price":"145.00"},"8659680017":{"sku":"8659680017","vendor_sku":"700330003","upc":"666898365241","size":"42 EU","color":"PARROT","retail_price":"145.00","sale_price":"145.00"},"8659680018":{"sku":"8659680018","vendor_sku":"700330003","upc":"666898365258","size":"42.5 EU","color":"PARROT","retail_price":"145.00","sale_price":"145.00"},"8659680019":{"sku":"8659680019","vendor_sku":"700330003","upc":"666898365265","size":"43 EU","color":"PARROT","retail_price":"145.00","sale_price":"145.00"},"8659680020":{"sku":"8659680020","vendor_sku":"700330003","upc":"666898365272","size":"43.5 EU","color":"PARROT","retail_price":"145.00","sale_price":"145.00"},"8659680021":{"sku":"8659680021","vendor_sku":"700330003","upc":"666898365289","size":"44 EU","color":"PARROT","retail_price":"145.00","sale_price":"145.00"},"8659680022":{"sku":"8659680022","vendor_sku":"700330003","upc":"666898365296","size":"44.5 EU","color":"PARROT","retail_price":"145.00","sale_price":"145.00"}},"categories":["climbing","climbing-shoes","mens-climbing-shoes"]}
