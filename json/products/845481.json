{"sku":"845481","manufacturer_id":"11881","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":"REI Half Dome 2 Plus Tent","long_description":"Lightweight, weather worthy and strong for 3-season use, the REI Half Dome 2 Plus backpacking tent offers generous headroom, storage and easy access for 2. 2 side doors and 2 vestibules offer easy access and generous storage; 4 vents ensure the tent stays well ventilated. Plus sizing provides more room with an extended floor plan; it's 10 in. longer and 4 in. wider than the standard REI Half Dome 2. Rectangular floor plan optimizes usable space and allows comfortable sleeping shoulder-to-shoulder or head-to-toe. Color-coded poles and pole clips ensure an easy setup. Advanced frame design combines DAC(R) Pressfit poles with a unique dual-hub architecture to provide area-wide headroom with nearly vertical side and end walls. Exclusive Tension Truss architecture leverages bound seams to provide low-weight structural stability and to increase interior volume. 4 adjustable, high-level ceiling vents mitigate condensation by drawing cool air under the fly and exhausting warm, moist air. Hybrid floor combines sealed seams and bathtub curves to create a waterproof floor that stays taut for easy door zipper operation and to maximize volume at end walls. Multiple storage options include corner pockets, roof pockets and hang loops; additional pockets do double duty as gear storage and stash spots for the doors. Shape and position of tent door zippers allow for smooth, 1-hand operation; vestibule zipper can be opened more or less to fine tune weather protection and ventilation. Polyester rainfly holds a consistently taut pitch, is durable and resists UV degradation. No-wick welded construction ensures that moisture won't sneak through susceptible areas, such as guy-out points, pole wraps and zippers. Includes guylines with tighteners, stakes and pole repair tube; tapered, easy-to-stuff compression stuff sack, pole- and stake bags keep everyhing organized.","short_description":"Lightweight, weather worthy and strong for 3-season use, the REI Half Dome 2 Plus backpacking tent offers generous headroom, storage and easy access for 2.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Tents","product_group":"Backpacking Tents","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s423867.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l423867.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=423867&tt=df","retail_price":"219.00","sale_price":"219.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=423867\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m423867.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=845481&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8454810001":{"sku":"8454810001","vendor_sku":"11881","upc":"484548100017","color":"APPLEMINT/BOXWOOD","retail_price":"219.00","sale_price":"219.00"},"8454810002":{"sku":"8454810002","vendor_sku":"11881","upc":"484548100024","color":"ORANGE SKY/REDROCK","retail_price":"219.00","sale_price":"219.00"}}}
