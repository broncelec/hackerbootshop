Floaty 110mm waists and a lightweight design mean the skis ride high in the deep stuff, and wood cores provide smooth handling at high speeds. Early rise in the tips and tails enhances skiing in powder and soft snow, and traditional camber underfoot enhances edge grip on firm snow. Sidewall construction ensures maximum torsional rigidity, uncanny edge grip and controlled tip-to-tail flex; sidewall is reinforced in binding area with 3 layers of material. Half cap construction in tips and tails reduces swing weight and chipping when your skis bang together. 110mm waists of the women's Atomic Millennium skis require bindings with wide brakes. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.","short_description":"Destined for the great days on the mountain, the women's Atomic Millennium skis offer the high flotation of 110mm waists and rockered tips and tails specifically designed for powder.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s461407.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l461407.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=461407&tt=df","retail_price":"599.00","sale_price":"479.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=461407\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m461407.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=860809&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8608090001":{"sku":"8608090001","vendor_sku":"AA0024852169","upc":"884397739121","size":"169 CM","retail_price":"479.93","sale_price":"479.93"},"8608090002":{"sku":"8608090002","vendor_sku":"AA0024852177","upc":"884397739138","size":"177 CM","retail_price":"479.93","sale_price":"479.93"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
