PolarizedPlus2 lenses eliminate 99.9% of glare; patented multilayer design and lens treatment maximize color transmission and enhance visible color. MauiPure is an incredibly lightweight lens material for all-day wear; waterproof, oil-resistant coating sheds water and repels grease and smudges. Gloss Black Fade frames feature Neutral Grey lenses for especially bright, direct sunlight; they offer rich color and contrast along with very high light production. Rootbeer Fade frames feature HCL (High Contrast Lens) Bronze lenses for added contrast on overcast or foggy days; subtle bronze tint is ideal for variable sunlight. Grilamid frame is ultra-thin and lightweight for superior, long-wearing comfort and flexibility. Traditional pin hinges; Rabalon nose pads help prevent slippage and are adjustable for a secure, custom fit; rubber temple inserts provide extra grip. The Maui Jim Bamboo Forest Polarized Sunglasses feature a modified rectangle design that complements round, oval and heart/triangular shaped faces.","short_description":"The Maui Jim Bamboo Forest Polarized Sunglasses combine the brilliance of MauiPure lenses, full frame flexibility, and the lightest frame yet created by Maui Jim.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sunglasses","product_group":"Sport Sunglasses","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s451055.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l451055.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=451055&tt=df","keywords":"Cycling","retail_price":"219.00","sale_price":"219.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=451055\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m451055.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=869204&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8692040001":{"sku":"8692040001","vendor_sku":"415-02J","upc":"603429028541","size":"NEUTRAL GREY","color":"GLOSS BLACK FADE","retail_price":"219.00","sale_price":"219.00"},"8692040002":{"sku":"8692040002","vendor_sku":"H415-26B","upc":"603429028558","size":"HCL BRONZE","color":"ROOTBEER FADE","retail_price":"219.00","sale_price":"219.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sunglasses","sport-sunglasses"]}
