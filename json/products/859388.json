{"sku":"859388","manufacturer_id":"RACQE02","brand_name":"Rossignol","product_name":" Rossignol S7 Pro Skis - Juniors' - 2013/2014","long_description":"Intended for powder-hungry, junior freeriders, the Rossignol S7 Pro skis offer the same performance as their adult-size counterparts. Skis feature an early rise in the tip and tail and a standard camber underfoot for unsurpassed flotation in deep powder and responsive grip on hardpack. Wood core creates a light and lively ski with excellent ski-to-snow feel and superb damping characteristics. Fiberglass laminates enhances pop and create a fun, lively feel to the skis. Rossitop cap construction boosts durability. Riders will enjoy remarkable edge grip and playful responsiveness thanks to a sidecut that's centered underfoot. Directional twin-tip profile excels when going forward but allows for landing jumps and riding backward. The juniors' Rossignol S7 Pro skis feature 90mm waists that require bindings with wide brakes. Recommended skier weight ranges from 70 to 119 lbs. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.","short_description":"Intended for powder-hungry, junior freeriders, the Rossignol S7 Pro skis offer the same performance as their adult-size counterparts.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s444183.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l444183.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=444183&tt=df","keywords":"jstp7615","retail_price":"299.00","sale_price":"299.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=444183\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m444183.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859388&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8593880001":{"sku":"8593880001","vendor_sku":"RACQE02","size":"140 CM","retail_price":"299.00","sale_price":"299.00"},"8593880002":{"sku":"8593880002","vendor_sku":"RACQE02","size":"150 CM","retail_price":"299.00","sale_price":"299.00"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
