{"sku":"838251","manufacturer_id":"U120101301250","brand_name":"Atlas","product_name":"Atlas 925 Snowshoes Starter Kit","long_description":"This Atlas 925 snowshoes starter kit combines a set of Atlas 925 snowshoes, a pair of poles and a tote bag for great value and convenience. Durable frames are crafted from 6061 aluminum to create a stiff yet lightweight chassis. Nose and tail shapes are optimized to provide a balanced platform for stable footing and facilitate an easy, natural stride. Free-Rotating(TM) Suspension lets the binding rotate much farther forward than previous Atlas designs, freeing up the stride and reducing the amount of tail flip. The result of the design is that freedom of movement is increased, the toe crampon can bite into snow better and the foot is allowed a more natural rotation. Wrapp(TM) Trail bindings use a continuous webbing design that tightens snugly with a single pull; bindings also cradle feet and arches for a secure, comfortable fit. Abrasion-resistant, lightweight Nytex(TM) nylon decks stay flexible when cold and stand up to the elements for lasting use. Steel toe crampons supply sure-footed traction on icy and snowy terrain; heel crampons increase traction while traversing and descending. 2-part, adjustable-length poles assist with balance and propulsion; features lightweight 6000-series aluminum shafts, plastic grips and steel flex-tips. Poles also have wide, alpine powder baskets for pushing/planting stability and adjustable hand straps that minimize fatigue and enhance support. Poles adjust up to 130cm in length. Includes heavyweight nylon tote/storage bag with mesh panels that allow snowshoes to dry out after use. Atlas 925 snowshoes' recommended load specification includes weight of hiker with gear.","short_description":"This Atlas 925 snowshoes starter kit combines a set of Atlas 925 snowshoes, a pair of poles and a tote bag for great value and convenience.","category":"Snowshoeing","subcategory":"Snowshoes","product_group":"Men's Snowshoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s463815.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l463815.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=463815&tt=df","retail_price":"209.95","sale_price":"167.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=463815\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m463815.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=838251&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8382510001":{"sku":"8382510001","vendor_sku":"U120101301250","upc":"714636946662","size":"25 IN","color":"CHARCOAL/FLAME","retail_price":"167.93","sale_price":"167.93"}},"categories":["snow","snowshoes","mens-snowshoes"]}
