{"sku":"832060","manufacturer_id":"WS1112","brand_name":"Bob","product_name":" BOB Revolution Duallie Stroller Weather Shield","long_description":"This BOB Revolution Duallie Stroller weather shield helps keep young children protected from the elements while enjoying a ride in their stroller. Made of a water- and wind-resistant polyurethane-coated nylon shell with clear water-resistant TPU window so the children can see out, and you can see them. Vents are positioned to allow proper airflow while keeping your children completely dry. Designed specifically for BOB Revolution Duallie strollers, sold separately. Please note: stroller canopy must be in correct position for proper Weather Shield installation; 2011 and newer strollers have rip-and-stick tabs to facilitate this. Older strollers must use retrofit kit to replace the canopy drawcord; kit can be obtained from BOB by contacting their customer service department.","short_description":"This BOB Revolution Duallie Stroller weather shield helps keep young children protected from the elements while enjoying a ride in their stroller.","category":"Fitness","subcategory":"Running","product_group":"Strollers","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s427475.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l427475.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=427475&tt=df","retail_price":"69.00","sale_price":"69.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=427475\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m427475.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=832060&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8320600001":{"sku":"8320600001","vendor_sku":"WS1112","upc":"692176705478","retail_price":"69.00","sale_price":"69.00"}}}
