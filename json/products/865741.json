{"sku":"865741","manufacturer_id":"234161-008","brand_name":"Scott","product_name":"Scott Sub Speed 10 Bike - 2014","long_description":"With bold color and stand-out style for commuting and urban streets, the Scott Sub Speed 10 bike features a low-maintenance internally geared 8-speed hub with belt drive and powerful disc brakes. Butted 6061 aluminum frame offers a sturdy, nimble ride for navigating city streets; flat handlebar creates a comfortable, upright riding position. Shimano Alfine internally geared rear hub provides 8 smooth-shifting gears and is low-maintenance compared to conventional cassette and derailleur systems. Gates Belt Drive uses a carbon-reinforced belt instead of a chain-this system is exceptionally long lasting, virtually maintenance free and nearly silent. Belt Drive system doesn't require lubrication, meaning no greasy chain. Shimano Alfine trigger shifter quickly snaps through the 8 gears. Sure-stopping and low-maintenance Shimano hydraulic disc brakes work effectively in all weather conditions. Continental Sport Contact tires offer great all-around rolling performance and puncture protection for urban use. Just get on and ride, no fancy shoes required-platform pedals accommodate a variety of shoes. Frame also features eyelets for fenders and rear rack (not included). Specs on the Scott Sub Speed 10 bike are subject to change.","short_description":"With bold color and stand-out style for commuting and urban streets, the Scott Sub Speed 10 bike features a low-maintenance internally geared 8-speed hub with belt drive and powerful disc brakes.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bikes","product_group":"Hybrid Bikes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s465687.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l465687.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=465687&tt=df","retail_price":"1299.00","sale_price":"1299.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=465687\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m465687.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=865741&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8657410001":{"sku":"8657410001","vendor_sku":"234161-006","upc":"886118608686","size":"S","color":"RED/WHITE","retail_price":"1299.00","sale_price":"1299.00"},"8657410002":{"sku":"8657410002","vendor_sku":"234161-007","upc":"886118608693","size":"M","color":"RED/WHITE","retail_price":"1299.00","sale_price":"1299.00"},"8657410003":{"sku":"8657410003","vendor_sku":"234161-008","upc":"886118608709","size":"L","color":"RED/WHITE","retail_price":"1299.00","sale_price":"1299.00"},"8657410004":{"sku":"8657410004","vendor_sku":"234161-009","upc":"886118608716","size":"XL","color":"RED/WHITE","retail_price":"1299.00","sale_price":"1299.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bikes","hybrid-bikes"]}
