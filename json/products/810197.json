{"sku":"810197","manufacturer_id":"05134","brand_name":"Msr","product_name":" MSR Backcountry Barn Tent","long_description":"The Backcountry Barn tent from MSR is unique in its class. The single-wall construction affords amazingly spacious protection for 4 - 5 people in a relatively small package. Easy-pitching hooped design offers standing head clearance from end to end for most; steep sidewalls expand livable space to its maximum potential. Detachable floor lets you adapt the interior for anything from covering a picnic table or storing group gear, to sleeping quarters or a remote race checkpoint/aid station. Straightforward design keeps setup uncommonly easy for a tent of this size. 6 ft. 2 in. center height end-to-end and large windows at front and rear allow great ventilation in any weather; awnings over both ends increase weather protection. Advanced design and multiple guyout points add security in windy conditions. Detachable bathtub floor is waterproof. 8 internal mesh pockets and 3 lantern hooks. MSR Backcountry Barn's single-wall design allows a packed size comparable to many 3-person tents.","short_description":"The Backcountry Barn tent from MSR is unique in its class.
