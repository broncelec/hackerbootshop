{"sku":"835224","manufacturer_id":"8050701","brand_name":"Whispbar","product_name":" Whispbar Through Roof Bar - Pair","long_description":"Carrying wide loads, the extended Whispbar Through Roof Bars are a virtually silent roof rack system. Extended length of bars allows for more load carrying capacity. 4 bar lengths available: S15 = 1,090 mm/43 in; S16 = 1,190 mm/47 in.; S17 = 1,340 mm/52.5 in.; S18 = 1,490 mm/58.75 in. Vehicle-specific Whispbar SmartFoot fitting kit (sold separately) is required for installation; refer to Rack Fitting Guide to find your kit. Whispbar crossbars are designed with an aerofoil shape (think airplane wing) that allows air to pass over with less resistance, reducing drag and increasing fuel efficiency. Whispbar accommodates most universal attachments and t-slot attachments for bike, water, snow and cargo accessories. Aerodynamic bar profile reduces wind noise and drag up to 70% less than other roof racks. Includes bars, integrated towers and mounting hardware. Locks are standard and 2 SKS keys are included. Whispbar Through Bars have a maximum hauling load of 165.35 lb/75 kg. Please use the Yakima fit guide to select proper Whispbar lengths for your vehicle.","short_description":"Carrying wide loads, the extended Whispbar Through Roof Bars are a virtually silent roof rack system.","category":"Car Racks","subcategory":"Base Roof Racks","product_group":"Car Rack Kits","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s407863.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l407863.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=407863&tt=df","retail_price":"449.00","sale_price":"449.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=407863\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m407863.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=835224&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8352240001":{"sku":"8352240001","vendor_sku":"8050701","upc":"736745507015","size":"S15","retail_price":"449.00","sale_price":"449.00"},"8352240003":{"sku":"8352240003","vendor_sku":"8050705","upc":"736745507053","size":"S17","retail_price":"449.00","sale_price":"449.00"},"8352240004":{"sku":"8352240004","vendor_sku":"8050707","upc":"736745507077","size":"S18","retail_price":"449.00","sale_price":"449.00"}},"categories":["car-racks","base-roof-racks","car-rack-kits"]}
