{"sku":"823050","manufacturer_id":"05024100 1N4","brand_name":"Nordica","product_name":" Nordica Hot Rod 9.0 Ski Boots - Women's - 2010/2011","long_description":"The women's Nordica Hot Rod 9.0 ski boots let you enjoy run after run all over the mountain thanks to their versatile design and soft cushioning. Dual-density plastic maximizes ease of entry regardless of temperature; even if you have high insteps, getting your foot in the boot is hassle free. As compared to men's liners, women-specific liners feature extra padding in the tongue, more insulation throughout and a contoured top edge designed to fit women's calves. Liners wrap the feet in cushioning foam and warm faux fur; closed-cell foam against the shells enhances warmth. Additional padding in the tongues and cuffs absorbs shock and damps vibrations, making your ride smooth and easy. Liners provide a personalized fit when custom molded. Built into the shell, a shock-absorbent wedge provides superb vibration damping while stomping big-air landings. Shock-absorbent toe boxes pad the front of your feet, reducing painful toe bang. Footbeds optimize foot position and offer easy support for comfortable wear all day long. Offering a comfortable fit from your instep to your calf, 4 microadjustable buckles precisely dial in the pressure. Top buckles make it easy to engage and close the top portion of the boot: a sliding cam shifts the point of leverage while closing the buckle, reducing effort. 40mm cuff strap acts as a fifth buckle, allowing you to set the firmness around the upper ankle to favor comfort or performance. Top of the boot a little tight? Cuffs feature an adjustable hex nut that increases the circumference of the top of the boot by 3 - 5mm. Double canting adjusts the cuffs to fit the angles of your lower legs and offers a versatile range of adjustment. Flex adjustment on spine decreases flex index by 10 if desired. Nordica Hot Rod 9.0 ski boots have a flex index of 80 - 90, providing the responsive power transfer preferred by aggressive, expert skiers.","short_description":"The women's Nordica Hot Rod 9.0 ski boots let you enjoy run after run all over the mountain thanks to their versatile design and soft cushioning.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Downhill Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382427.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382427.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382427&tt=df","retail_price":"449.00","sale_price":"269.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382427\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382427.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=823050&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8230500001":{"sku":"8230500001","vendor_sku":"05024100 1N4","upc":"883506948362","size":"Mondo 23.5","color":"TRUE SILVER/TRUE GREEN MI","retail_price":"269.83","sale_price":"269.83"}},"categories":["snow","ski-boots","downhill-ski-boots"]}
