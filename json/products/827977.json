{"sku":"827977","manufacturer_id":"10969","brand_name":"Arc'teryx","product_name":"Arc'teryx Beta SL Jacket - Women's","long_description":"Packable and lightweight, the women's Arc'teryx Beta SL is an excellent all-around Gore-Tex(R) PacLite(R) jacket and an ideal emergency layer for hikers and trekkers. With user-friendly features like large handwarmer pockets, a trim-fitting hood and dropped rear hem the women's Beta SL is great to have along when the weather turns nasty. 2.5-layer Gore-Tex PacLite is engineered specifically to be light, packable and more breathable than other 2- or 3-layer Gore-Tex fabrics. A waterproof membrane is laminated to the shell fabric and then covered by a thin, durable protective coating made of an oleophobic (oil-hating) substance. Light and compact fabric combines durable wind- and waterproofness with exceptional breathability. Very small seam allowances increase breathability and suppleness and decrease weight; all seams are sealed for complete protection. Laminated, watertight front zipper features an inner laminated draft flap; chin guard protects skin. Gusseted underarms ensure unhindered movement and let jacket remain in place when arms are raised. 2 hand pockets. Features watertight laminated pocket zippers, laminated hem drawcord tunnel and laminated, die-cut rip-and-stick wrist closures. Droptail hemline is higher in front for mobility and a bit longer in back for extra coverage and protection. Arc'teryx Beta SL has a trim, athletic fit with extra articulation.","short_description":"Packable and lightweight, the women's Arc'teryx Beta SL is an excellent all-around Gore-Tex(R) PacLite(R) jacket and an ideal emergency layer for hikers and trekkers.","category":"Women's Clothing","subcategory":"Women's Jackets","product_group":"Women's Rain Jackets","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s393847.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l393847.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=393847&tt=df","keywords":"hardshell","retail_price":"299.00","sale_price":"299.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=393847\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m393847.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=827977&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8279770001":{"sku":"8279770001","vendor_sku":"10969","upc":"806955522327","size":"XS","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"299.00","sale_price":"299.00"},"8279770005":{"sku":"8279770005","vendor_sku":"10969","upc":"806955522310","size":"XL","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"299.00","sale_price":"299.00"},"8279770041":{"sku":"8279770041","vendor_sku":"10969","upc":"806955682649","size":"XS","color":"CALYPSO","retail_price":"299.00","sale_price":"299.00"},"8279770044":{"sku":"8279770044","vendor_sku":"10969","upc":"806955682601","size":"L","color":"CALYPSO","retail_price":"299.00","sale_price":"299.00"},"8279770045":{"sku":"8279770045","vendor_sku":"10969","upc":"806955682632","size":"XL","color":"CALYPSO","retail_price":"299.00","sale_price":"299.00"},"8279770049":{"sku":"8279770049","vendor_sku":"10969","upc":"806955682656","size":"L","color":"CHERRYWINE","retail_price":"299.00","sale_price":"299.00"},"8279770051":{"sku":"8279770051","vendor_sku":"10969","upc":"806955682595","size":"XS","color":"MIDORI GREEN","retail_price":"299.00","sale_price":"299.00"},"8279770053":{"sku":"8279770053","vendor_sku":"10969","upc":"806955682564","size":"M","color":"MIDORI GREEN","retail_price":"299.00","sale_price":"299.00"},"8279770054":{"sku":"8279770054","vendor_sku":"10969","upc":"806955682557","size":"L","color":"MIDORI GREEN","retail_price":"299.00","sale_price":"299.00"},"8279770055":{"sku":"8279770055","vendor_sku":"10969","upc":"806955682588","size":"XL","color":"MIDORI GREEN","retail_price":"299.00","sale_price":"299.00"}},"categories":["womens","womens-jackets","womens-rain-jackets"]}
