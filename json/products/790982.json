{"sku":"790982","manufacturer_id":"701","brand_name":"Sea To Summit","product_name":" Sea to Summit Aquaracks Watercraft Storage System","long_description":"The Sea to Summit Aquaracks securely store your watercraft out of harm's way. They work with kayaks, sit-on-tops, stand up paddleboards and canoes. Specially designed padded arms prevent depressions on the hull and damages to the finish; suitable for both indoor or outdoor use. Any size craft can be supported at the strongest part of its hull by placing support arms at different spans. Support arms distribute load evenly without creating pressure points; most watercraft can be stored at multiple angles to facilitate cleaning. Closed-cell foam covered with a tough nylon sleeve protects the boat's finish. Stores large craft up to 175 lbs. Mounting kit included.","short_description":"The Sea to Summit Aquaracks securely store your watercraft out of harm's way.
