{"sku":"838121","manufacturer_id":"B120300702120","brand_name":"K2","product_name":"K2 Ryker Snowboard Boots - 2012/2013","long_description":"For all-mountain riders, K2 Ryker snowboard boots offer a great fit, all-day comfort and easy-to-use Boa(R) closures. Single Boa(R) Coiler adjusts Ryker boot exteriors with a quick twist, while Conda single-pull lacing locks liners from the outside. Intuition Comfort Fit 3D stitched liners feature Ultralon(R), a flexible custom moldable EVA foam designed to resist pressure-related pack out. Moldable internal J-bars hold heels securely; footbed support is engineered into the liner bottoms, and EVA insoles are added for supportive comfort. Conda single-pull liner lacing uses comfortable textile webbing handles to close liners from outside the boots; easy wrapping design quickly locks and releases webbing. Asymmetric, articulating cuffs and 3D-formed tongues are supportive and durable. Boa Coiler lacing system, with ankle and cable guides along entire edge of eyestays, distributes closure force evenly for a dialed-in fit that won't loosen up. The Coiler scoops up loose cable when entering as well as exiting the boot; put your foot in, pull back on the tongue, twist the reel a few times and you're off. Low-profile rubber outsoles with lightweight, 3D-molded midsoles offer grip and durability.","short_description":"For all-mountain riders, K2 Ryker snowboard boots offer a great fit, all-day comfort and easy-to-use Boa(R) closures.","category":"Snowboarding","subcategory":"Snowboard Boots","product_group":"Men's Snowboard Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s461587.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l461587.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=461587&tt=df","retail_price":"219.95","sale_price":"108.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=461587\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m461587.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=838121&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{},"extended_xml_attributes":"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t","categories":["snow","snowboard-boots","mens-snowboard-boots"]}
