{"sku":"853929","manufacturer_id":"15586","brand_name":"Novara","product_name":" Novara Conversion Bike Jacket - Women's","long_description":"The women's Novara Conversion bike jacket can be transformed into a vest quickly and easily, letting you comfortably adapt to changing weather throughout your ride. Sleeves can be detached from the main body of the jacket via zippers under arms. The detachable sleeves are connected as a single piece, which doubles as a shrug and can be worn over your bike jersey for light coverage; stows in zippered back pocket. Jacket uses a polyester material that is lightweight, water resistant and breathable-it also resists winds up to 50mph. Durable water repellent finish causes water to bead up and roll off, fending off light rain showers and snow. Removable, low profile hood shields ears from wind and fits comfortably under your helmet. Mesh-lined back enhances airflow and wicks away moisture to keep you comfortable. Open hand pockets stow small essentials. Cut long in back for full coverage when you're in the riding position. The women's Novara Conversion jacket has ample reflective piping that increases your visibility to others in low light.","short_description":"The women's Novara Conversion bike jacket can be transformed into a vest quickly and easily, letting you comfortably adapt to changing weather throughout your ride.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Cycling Clothing","product_group":"Cycling Jackets","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s391523.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l391523.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=391523&tt=df","retail_price":"79.50","sale_price":"79.50","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=391523\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m391523.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=853929&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8539290001":{"sku":"8539290001","vendor_sku":"15586","upc":"485392900013","size":"XS","color":"BRIGHT GREEN/MAGNET","retail_price":"79.50","sale_price":"79.50"},"8539290002":{"sku":"8539290002","vendor_sku":"15586","upc":"485392900020","size":"S","color":"BRIGHT GREEN/MAGNET","retail_price":"79.50","sale_price":"79.50"},"8539290003":{"sku":"8539290003","vendor_sku":"15586","upc":"485392900037","size":"M","color":"BRIGHT GREEN/MAGNET","retail_price":"79.50","sale_price":"79.50"},"8539290004":{"sku":"8539290004","vendor_sku":"15586","upc":"485392900044","size":"L","color":"BRIGHT GREEN/MAGNET","retail_price":"79.50","sale_price":"79.50"}},"categories":["cycling","cycling-clothing","cycling-jackets"]}
