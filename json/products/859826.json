{"sku":"859826","manufacturer_id":"5202-171-1314","brand_name":"Voile","product_name":" Voile Charger Telemark / Randonee Skis - 2013/2014","long_description":"The Voile Charger skis combine early-rise tips with traditional camber underfoot for excellent performance in backcountry powder and the ability to carve hard snow on your way back to the car. Lightweight construction makes these skis a good choice for tours in deep snow; aspen wood cores are wrapped in fiberglass that is woven with carbon for a light, snappy feel. Early-rise tips help you float through the deep powder on the descent and ease trail breaking in deep snow during the ascent. Tails of the skis turn up just a touch and are compatible with the tail attachments of most climbing skins (sold separately). Traditional sidecut underfoot lets you carve turns on firm snow as you make your way out of the woods. Voile Charger skis have sintered bases that retain wax well and provide good glide. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.","short_description":"The Voile Charger skis combine early-rise tips with traditional camber underfoot for excellent performance in backcountry powder and the ability to carve hard snow on your way back to the car.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Backcountry Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s381807.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l381807.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=381807&tt=df","retail_price":"595.00","sale_price":"415.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=381807\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m381807.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859826&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8598260001":{"sku":"8598260001","vendor_sku":"5202-171-1314","upc":"759948908748","size":"171 CM","retail_price":"415.93","sale_price":"415.93"},"8598260002":{"sku":"8598260002","vendor_sku":"5202-181-1314","upc":"759948908755","size":"181 CM","retail_price":"415.93","sale_price":"415.93"},"8598260003":{"sku":"8598260003","vendor_sku":"5202-191-1314","upc":"759948908762","size":"191 CM","retail_price":"415.93","sale_price":"415.93"}}}
