{"sku":"865157","manufacturer_id":"06423","brand_name":"Therm-A-Rest","product_name":" Therm-a-Rest Trail Lite Sleeping Pad - Women's","long_description":"The women's Therm-a-Rest Trail Lite(TM) Sleeping Pad offers an outstanding combination of comfort, compactness and value, making it one of the best all-around mattresses available. Die-cut foam reduces weight and bulk, making the pad light enough for backpacking, yet comfortable and durable enough for car camping. Designed specifically for women and cold sleepers, this pad has fewer die-cuts than the unisex version to add critical warmth in the hip, torso and foot areas. Features a new, straighter torso compared to the previous version, which increases sleep area and makes for better, gap-free mating with other rectangular pads. R-value equals 4.9; most sleeping pads we sell range in R-value from 1.0 (minimally insulated) to 9.5 (well insulated). The women's Therm-a-Rest Trail Lite Sleeping Pad includes a stuff sack.","short_description":"The women's Therm-a-Rest Trail Lite(TM) Sleeping Pad offers an outstanding combination of comfort, compactness and value, making it one of the best all-around mattresses available.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Pads, Cots And Hammocks","product_group":"Sleeping Pads","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s422255.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l422255.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=422255&tt=df","keywords":"mattress,mats","retail_price":"69.95","sale_price":"69.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=422255\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m422255.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=865157&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8651570001":{"sku":"8651570001","vendor_sku":"06423","upc":"040818064238","size":"Regular","color":"CLOVER PRINT","retail_price":"69.95","sale_price":"69.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sleeping-pads-cots-and-hammocks","sleeping-pads"]}
