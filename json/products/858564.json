{"sku":"858564","manufacturer_id":"10623100011","brand_name":"Burton","product_name":" Burton Ambush Snowboard Boots - 2013/2014","long_description":"With mid-range response for amazing control in the park, the Burton Ambush boots combine lightning fast entry and cushioned, comfortable liners for lasting performance. Shrinkage(TM) technology reduces boot's overall footprint by 1 full size, minimizing boot overhang, bulk and weight. Imprint(TM) 3 liners with Focus Cuffs ride higher on the ankles for increased agility and response; liners feature rip-and-stick closures. Liners provide a consistent flex over time and slide on and off feet easily; precurved ankle panels reduce lace pressure on front of legs. Molded EVA footbeds with a supportive shank lessen the blow of hardpack landings; antimicrobial coating fights odors. Streamlined Speed Zone(TM) shell lacing lets you fine-tune the upper and lower zones in seconds; this system offers powerful rebound, wrap and response with minimal effort. Medium-flexing, slim, 3D-molded tongues wrap your forefeet in comfort, offer a seamless flex and reduce performance-robbing shell/liner stack-up. Boots feature strategically placed flex notches that allow smooth, fluid lateral and medial flex, perfect for nose bones and tweaked out tail grab. Flexible backstay spines increase medial/lateral support, edge-to-edge response and durability. Snowproof internal gussets on boot tongues completely seal lower boot zones to keep feet warm and dry. Super lightweight DynoLite EST midsoles/outsoles offer cushioning, improved board feel and consistent support throughout; ultra damping B3 gel inserts cushion feet.","short_description":"With mid-range response for amazing control in the park, the Burton Ambush boots combine lightning fast entry and cushioned, comfortable liners for lasting performance.","category":"Snowboarding","subcategory":"Snowboard Boots","product_group":"Men's Snowboard Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s383143.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l383143.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=383143&tt=df","retail_price":"249.95","sale_price":"174.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=383143\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m383143.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=858564&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8585640001":{"sku":"8585640001","vendor_sku":"10623100011","upc":"886888433204","size":"8.5","color":"BLACK/BLUE","retail_price":"174.83","sale_price":"174.83"},"8585640002":{"sku":"8585640002","vendor_sku":"10623100011","upc":"886888433211","size":"9","color":"BLACK/BLUE","retail_price":"174.83","sale_price":"174.83"},"8585640005":{"sku":"8585640005","vendor_sku":"10623100011","upc":"886888433105","size":"10.5","color":"BLACK/BLUE","retail_price":"174.83","sale_price":"174.83"},"8585640007":{"sku":"8585640007","vendor_sku":"10623100011","upc":"886888433129","size":"11.5","color":"BLACK/BLUE","retail_price":"174.83","sale_price":"174.83"}},"categories":["snow","snowboard-boots","mens-snowboard-boots"]}
