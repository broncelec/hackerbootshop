{"sku":"822512","manufacturer_id":"37006","brand_name":"Superfeet","product_name":"Superfeet Copper DMP Premium Insoles - Low to Medium Volume","long_description":"Superfeet Copper DMP premium insoles use a passive molding process to shape the insoles to your feet, providing a custom, supportive platform underfoot. Multiple layers of material work to support feet while a dynamic, impressionable foam molds to the shape of your feet without compromising stability or cushioning. Molding does not require the use of an external heat source-simply slide the Copper DMP insoles into your shoes and the they conform to your feet as you use them. 3/4-length polypropylene heel caps cradle heels, stabilize feet and provide arch support; reinforced midfoot area helps maintain midfoot flexibility.
