{"sku":"790584","manufacturer_id":"134 361 515","brand_name":"Native Eyewear","product_name":"Native Eyewear Bomber Polarized Sunglasses - Men's","long_description":"Giving you a wide berth of coverage, the Native Eyewear Bomber Polararized sunglasses provide sun and glare protection from sand, snow, apshalt and water. Polarized lenses reduce 99% of visible glare from water, snow, sand and pavement for increased visual acuity and decreased eye strain. Polarized Crystal Carbonate(R) (P.C.C.) lenses have the strongest hard coating available to protect against scratching. P.C.C. lenses pass the rigorous ANSI Z80.3 tests for optical clarity and impact resistance while blocking 100% of harmful UVA and UVB light. Rhyno-Tuff(R) AIR frames endure extreme highs and lows in temperature. Anti-Ocular Intrusion System(R), a 4-point configuration, helps prevent lenses from shooting into your face in the event of high-velocity impact. Venting system incorporated into the frames enhances airflow and virtually eliminates fog and condensation. Self-adjusting Cushinol(TM) nosepads and ear stems create a nonslip grip that keeps sunglasses in place, ensuring a soft feel and personalized fit. Cam-action spring hinges allow the temples to quickly lock into position. Sized to fit large to extra-large faces. Wood frames feature polarized brown lenses that are ideal for moderate to bright sunlight. Iron frames feature polarized gray lenses that are ideal for extremely bright sunlight.","short_description":"Giving you a wide berth of coverage, the Native Eyewear Bomber Polararized sunglasses provide sun and glare protection from sand, snow, apshalt and water.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sunglasses","product_group":"Sport Sunglasses","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s422815.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l422815.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=422815&tt=df","keywords":"Cycling","retail_price":"99.00","sale_price":"99.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=422815\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m422815.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=790584&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7905840018":{"sku":"7905840018","vendor_sku":"134 300 502","upc":"764824006173","color":"IRON/GRAY","retail_price":"99.00","sale_price":"99.00"},"7905840026":{"sku":"7905840026","vendor_sku":"134 361 515","upc":"764824006180","color":"WOOD/BROWN","retail_price":"99.00","sale_price":"99.00"},"7905840034":{"sku":"7905840034","vendor_sku":"134 302 502","upc":"764824006166","color":"ASPHALT/GRAY","retail_price":"99.00","sale_price":"99.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sunglasses","sport-sunglasses"]}
