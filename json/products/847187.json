Suspension offers legendary Gregory comfort and strong, light support with a patented hipbelt alignment system, streamlined back panel and wire wishbone frame. Shoulder straps feature a layer of monofilament mesh, perforated EVA foam and 2 layers of air-mesh on the top and bottom, all bonded together for breathability and comfort. Hipbelt auto-adjusts to fit your unique body shape the moment you put on the pack; ventilated air channels and breathable spacer mesh on the back panel permit cooling airflow. Light and sturdy wire wishbone frame provides effective load transfer to your lumbar area; integrated cross-stay helps maintain proper pack shape and prevents barreling. Innovative packing system features 3 sections that separate your trail gear from camp items, and keeps frequently-grabbed essentials at your fingertips. Each section allows easy access to your gear when you need it and distributes the weight properly for intuitive packing and comfortable carry. Highly water-resistant top pocket features a waterproof zipper and sealed seams; top-loading design features a quick-draw closure and a stash pocket under the lid. External hydration sleeve makes it easy to access and fill your reservoir; it attaches directly to internal frame (reservoir sold separately). Organize gear within easy reach with a side security pocket, large front dump pocket, dual oversize side pockets and hipbelt pockets. 2-stage compression straps on the lower pack body and over the main top opening help stabilize and compress your load. Integrated raincover helps keep contents dry when the weather takes a wet turn.","short_description":"A backpacking breakthrough, the lightweight Gregory Contour 70 pack offers precise Gregory fit, innovative organization and efficient gear access for comfort and performance deep into the wilderness.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Backpacks","product_group":"Backpacking Packs","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s410647.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l410647.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=410647&tt=df","keywords":"multiday","retail_price":"299.00","sale_price":"299.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=410647\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m410647.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=847187&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8471870001":{"sku":"8471870001","vendor_sku":"GM59836","upc":"844930069733","size":"S","color":"GRAPHITE GRAY","retail_price":"299.00","sale_price":"299.00"},"8471870002":{"sku":"8471870002","vendor_sku":"GM59837","upc":"844930069740","size":"M","color":"GRAPHITE GRAY","retail_price":"299.00","sale_price":"299.00"},"8471870003":{"sku":"8471870003","vendor_sku":"GM59838","upc":"844930069757","size":"L","color":"GRAPHITE GRAY","retail_price":"299.00","sale_price":"299.00"},"8471870004":{"sku":"8471870004","vendor_sku":"GM59839","upc":"844930069764","size":"S","color":"REFLEX BLUE","retail_price":"299.00","sale_price":"299.00"},"8471870006":{"sku":"8471870006","vendor_sku":"GM59841","upc":"844930069788","size":"L","color":"REFLEX BLUE","retail_price":"299.00","sale_price":"299.00"}}}
