{"sku":"860344","manufacturer_id":"T3R6N.9147","brand_name":"Asics","product_name":"ASICS GT-1000 2 Road-Running Shoes - Women's","long_description":"Updated with more rearfoot GEL(R) cushioning and sleek new uppers, the women's ASICS GT-1000 2 road-running shoes deliver a great fit and light stability for day-to-day running performance. Uppers are made of lightweight, flexible polyester mesh and synthetic textile to offer breathability and comfort. Wicking polyester linings move excess moisture away from feet and dry fast. Dual-density Solyte(R) lasting uses proprietary polymer material that's lighter than standard EVA and offers enhanced cushioning longevity. Forefoot and hindfoot GEL(R) silicone-based cushioning inserts absorb excess shock in all directions for great stability. Dual-density midsole posting improves stability and support. In addition, stability system midfoot creates a pocket between midsole supports, enhancing shock absorption and controlling midsole deformation for efficiency. High-performance blown rubber outsoles have abrasion-resistant material in the heels and forefoot material that cushions and increases traction and feel. Full-length SpEVA(R) lasting and full-blown rubber outsoles provide mild to moderate overpronators an extra boost of comfort. Vertical flex groove in outsoles follows the line of progression throughout the gait cycle to enhance gait efficiency. ASICS GT-1000 2 women's road-running shoes proudly carry the Seal of Acceptance from the American Podiatric Medical Association.","short_description":"Updated with more rearfoot GEL(R) cushioning and sleek new uppers, the women's ASICS GT-1000 2 road-running shoes deliver a great fit and light stability for day-to-day running performance.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Women's Footwear","product_group":"Women's Shoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s387735.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l387735.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=387735&tt=df","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=387735\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m387735.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=860344&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8603440002":{"sku":"8603440002","vendor_sku":"T3R5N.9147","upc":"887749122220","size":"6.5","color":"LIGHTNING/DAZZLING BLUE/P","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"},"8603440003":{"sku":"8603440003","vendor_sku":"T3R5N.9147","upc":"887749122237","size":"7","color":"LIGHTNING/DAZZLING BLUE/P","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"},"8603440004":{"sku":"8603440004","vendor_sku":"T3R5N.9147","upc":"887749122244","size":"7.5","color":"LIGHTNING/DAZZLING BLUE/P","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"},"8603440005":{"sku":"8603440005","vendor_sku":"T3R5N.9147","upc":"887749122251","size":"8","color":"LIGHTNING/DAZZLING BLUE/P","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"},"8603440006":{"sku":"8603440006","vendor_sku":"T3R5N.9147","upc":"887749122268","size":"8.5","color":"LIGHTNING/DAZZLING BLUE/P","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"},"8603440007":{"sku":"8603440007","vendor_sku":"T3R5N.9147","upc":"887749122275","size":"9","color":"LIGHTNING/DAZZLING BLUE/P","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"},"8603440010":{"sku":"8603440010","vendor_sku":"T3R5N.9147","upc":"887749122152","size":"10.5","color":"LIGHTNING/DAZZLING BLUE/P","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"},"8603440011":{"sku":"8603440011","vendor_sku":"T3R5N.9147","upc":"887749122169","size":"11","color":"LIGHTNING/DAZZLING BLUE/P","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"},"8603440014":{"sku":"8603440014","vendor_sku":"T3R6N.9147","size":"6 Wide","color":"LIGHTNING/DAZZLING BLUE/P","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"},"8603440015":{"sku":"8603440015","vendor_sku":"T3R6N.9147","upc":"887749122541","size":"6.5 Wide","color":"LIGHTNING/DAZZLING BLUE/P","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"},"8603440016":{"sku":"8603440016","vendor_sku":"T3R6N.9147","upc":"887749122558","size":"7 Wide","color":"LIGHTNING/DAZZLING BLUE/P","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"},"8603440017":{"sku":"8603440017","vendor_sku":"T3R6N.9147","upc":"887749122565","size":"7.5 Wide","color":"LIGHTNING/DAZZLING BLUE/P","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"},"8603440018":{"sku":"8603440018","vendor_sku":"T3R6N.9147","upc":"887749122572","size":"8 Wide","color":"LIGHTNING/DAZZLING BLUE/P","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"},"8603440020":{"sku":"8603440020","vendor_sku":"T3R6N.9147","upc":"887749122596","size":"9 Wide","color":"LIGHTNING/DAZZLING BLUE/P","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"},"8603440021":{"sku":"8603440021","vendor_sku":"T3R6N.9147","upc":"887749122602","size":"9.5 Wide","color":"LIGHTNING/DAZZLING BLUE/P","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"},"8603440023":{"sku":"8603440023","vendor_sku":"T3R6N.9147","size":"10.5 Wide","color":"LIGHTNING/DAZZLING BLUE/P","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"},"8603440024":{"sku":"8603440024","vendor_sku":"T3R6N.9147","upc":"887749122466","size":"11 Wide","color":"LIGHTNING/DAZZLING BLUE/P","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"}},"categories":["footwear","womens-footwear","womens-shoes"]}
