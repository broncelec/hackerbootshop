{"sku":"636832","manufacturer_id":"P-224383","brand_name":"Primus","product_name":" Primus Yellowstone Classic Trail Stove","long_description":"The Primus Yellowstone Classic Trail stove brings ease of use and an adjustable flame to backcountry and high-altitude cooking; great for the outdoor chef! Runs on Primus LP butane/propane cartridges which burn clean, won't spill and have a low freezing point-good for high-altitude cooking. Sturdy, lightweight, simple construction will appeal to the weight-conscious adventurer. Flame is adjustable for simmering, boiling or anything in between-just like your stove at home. Stove assembly attaches quickly and easily to the fuel cartridge, sold separately. Operates on isobutane-propane fuel canisters (sold separately). Due to flammable item shipping restrictions, we cannot sell fuel canisters online; they are available at REI retail stores. Weight includes stove, not the canister.","short_description":"The Primus Yellowstone Classic Trail stove brings ease of use and an adjustable flame to backcountry and high-altitude cooking; great for the outdoor chef!","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Camp Kitchen","product_group":"Stoves","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s416363.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l416363.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=416363&tt=df","retail_price":"19.95","sale_price":"19.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=416363\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m416363.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=636832&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"6368320013":{"sku":"6368320013","vendor_sku":"P-224383","retail_price":"19.95","sale_price":"19.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","camp-kitchen","stoves"]}
