The Heatseeker(TM) Eco insulation keeps you warm and is highly compressible for easy packing. With a European Norm (EN) lower-limit rating of 1degF, the Aleutian 0 is suitable for winter camping. Heatseeker(TM) Eco insulation offers a great warmth-to-weight ratio, is highly compressible and extremely durable; made with 30% post-consumer recycled material. Full-length zipper wraps all the way around the footbox so you can unzip and use the sleeping bag as a blanket. Unzip the short zipper opposite the full-length zipper so you can fold the front of the sleeping bag down like you would with a comforter at home. Roomy, comfort-oriented cut gives you ample space to move around. Full-length draft tube backing the zipper keeps the warmth in and the cold out; draft collar limits heat loss. Vaulted footbox allows natural foot movement and eliminates excess lateral space, increasing thermal efficiency to keep your feet warm and comfortable. European Norm (EN) is an independent third-party temperature rating, allowing accurate comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags.","short_description":"Sleep soundly through a frigid winter night with the synthetic The North Face Aleutian 0 Sleeping Bag.
