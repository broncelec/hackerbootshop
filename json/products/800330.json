Unique interchangeable system lets you switch out lenses without smudging the surfaces with fingerprints. Frame includes 1 set of polarized gray lenses and 1 set of SportFlex(TM) lenses, for a total of 2 sets of lenses. Additional SportFlex orange-yellow lenses have a blue mirror coating suitable for cloudy or overcast days, and dusk and dawn. Polarized Crystal Carbonate(R) (PCC) lenses have the strongest hard coating available to protect against scratching. PCC lenses pass the rigorous ANSI Z80.3 tests for optical clarity and impact resistance while blocking 100% of harmful UVA and UVB light. Extremely lightweight and flexible Rhyno-Tuff(R) AIR frames are engineered to endure extreme temperatures. Anti-Ocular Intrusion System(R), a 4-point configuration, helps prevent lenses from shooting into your face in the event of high-velocity impact. Self-adjusting Cushinol(TM) nosepads create a soft, nonslip grip that keeps sunglasses in place. Frame venting system enhances airflow and virtually eliminates fog and condensation. Xtra Protection lenses are approximately 20% larger than regular Dash sunglasses, providing increased coverage and protection; designed to fit medium to large profile. Also included is an Optic Gear Kit that features a semi-rigid zippered case and a soft pouch that doubles as a cleaning cloth.","short_description":"Designed for on-the-go activities, the Native Eyewear Dash XP polarized sunglasses offer unbeatable sun and glare protection.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sunglasses","product_group":"Sport Sunglasses","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s422851.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l422851.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=422851&tt=df","keywords":"Cycling","retail_price":"109.00","sale_price":"109.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=422851\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m422851.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=800330&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8003300012":{"sku":"8003300012","vendor_sku":"116 342 502","upc":"764824004339","color":"MAPLE TORT/GRAY","retail_price":"109.00","sale_price":"109.00"}}}
