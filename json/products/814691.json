{"sku":"814691","manufacturer_id":"06595","brand_name":"Msr","product_name":" MSR Alpinist 2 System Cookset","long_description":"Designed for an adventure-seeking twosome, the MSR Alpinist 2 System cookset combines light weight and strength with the capacity to melt snow and boil water. Cookset includes a 2.4-liter hard-anodized pot, a strainer pot lid, 2 polypropylene DeepDish plates, 2 insulated mugs and a pot handle. Hard-anodized aluminum is strong and light, and it spreads heat evenly for good cooking performance. Brushed aluminum lid features an integrated strainer to eliminate the hassle of draining water from noodles or steamed vegetables. Talon(TM) pot handle attaches to and removes from both pots via exterior brackets, ensuring you don't scratch the inner surfaces. 2 polypropylene DeepDish plates work well no matter what's on the menu, be it soup or pasta. 10.2 fl. oz. double-wall cups keep your drinks hot and easy to handle; include sip-through lids. Mugs and plates are color coded to prevent mixups. All components of the MSR Alpinist 2 System cookset fit within the 2.4-liter pot for easy packing; there's even room for an MSR Pocket Rocket(TM) stove (sold separately).","short_description":"Designed for an adventure-seeking twosome, the MSR Alpinist 2 System cookset combines light weight and strength with the capacity to melt snow and boil water.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Camp Kitchen","product_group":"Cookware And Dinnerware","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s414643.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l414643.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=414643&tt=df","keywords":"messkit","retail_price":"89.95","sale_price":"89.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=414643\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m414643.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=814691&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8146910001":{"sku":"8146910001","vendor_sku":"06595","upc":"040818053263","retail_price":"89.95","sale_price":"89.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","camp-kitchen","cookware-and-dinnerware"]}
