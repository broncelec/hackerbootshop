{"sku":"868135","manufacturer_id":"7020361","brand_name":"Easton","product_name":" Easton EA90 SLX Road Wheel - Front","long_description":"Fit for racing, cyclocross and commutes, the Easton EA90 SLX Front Road Wheel is a top-of-the-line aluminum wheel with all the fixin's: a smooth Echo hub, a wide rim width and tubeless compatability. Every aspect of the Echo hub is designed to improve bearing life, increase stiffness and cut weight, and the extra width of the hub vastly increases durability. Featuring a 17.5mm internal rim width, the extra-wide alloy rim creates more surface area for traction when leaning into corners. UST tubeless compatibility offers the benefits of tubeless (lighter weight, lower tire pressure and fewer flats), with the option of using a traditional tube/tire setup. 16 double-butted, straight-pull spokes create a low-weight, high-performance wheel; specialized dual-threaded spoke nipples require no special tools for service. The Easton EA90 SLX Front Road Wheel is completely hand-built; spoke tension is acoustically tuned to provide the best possible ride right out of the box.","short_description":"Fit for racing, cyclocross and commutes, the Easton EA90 SLX Front Road Wheel is a top-of-the-line aluminum wheel with all the fixin's: a smooth Echo hub, a wide rim width and tubeless compatability.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Components","product_group":"Bike Tires, Tubes And Wheels","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s453567.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l453567.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=453567&tt=df","retail_price":"500.00","sale_price":"500.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=453567\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m453567.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=868135&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8681350001":{"sku":"8681350001","vendor_sku":"7020361","upc":"768686935220","size":"700C","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"500.00","sale_price":"500.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-components","bike-tires-tubes-and-wheels"]}
