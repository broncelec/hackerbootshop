{"sku":"848878","manufacturer_id":"13600","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":"REI Habanera Sleeping Bag - Women's","long_description":"The women's REI Habanera cold-weather backpacking down sleeping bag features amazing compressibility and warmth while balancing price and performance. Women-specific bags are cut to match a woman's shape, and provide extra insulation and warmth in the hood and feet areas. Relaxed fit from the shoulders to the hips increases comfort by providing ample space to move around. High-quality 650-fill-power duck down is warm, lightweight and compressible. Exclusive REI Down Fill Calculator optimizes the amount of down per baffle for the most warmth with the least amount of down. 60% of insulation is put on top of bag where it contributes the most warmth and loft. Baffle spacing allows the down to remain fully lofted and keeps it from shifting, preventing cold spots. Ripstop polyester shell resists water and abrasion; smooth polyester taffeta lining is comfortable against your skin. Shell fabric is treated with a Durable Water Repellent finish to repel moisture and stains. Contoured hood, insulated full-face muffler and full-length draft tube with ground-level seams keep body heat in and cold air out. The REI Habenera down sleeping bag has an external chest pocket that keeps small essentials-headlamp, watch, glasses-right at hand and easy to find in the dark. Differentiated drawcords (1 round, 1 flat) let you adjust hood and neck easily in the dark. Full-length of zipper is backed by wide, antisnag binding tape. Any REI backpacking bag can be zipped to any other REI backpacking bag because of the consistent 63 in., No. 5, YKK zipper; women's bags zip on the right, men's on the left. Pad loops provide attachment points to keep your sleeping bag and pad together to avoid rolling off onto the cold ground (straps and sleeping pad sold separately). Includes stuff sack and storage bag.","short_description":"The women's REI Habanera cold-weather backpacking down sleeping bag features amazing compressibility and warmth while balancing price and performance.","category":"Camping & Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags","product_group":"Adult Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s305031.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l305031.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=305031&tt=df","keywords":"cold,bag,sleep,insulated,winter","retail_price":"279.00","sale_price":"279.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=305031\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m305031.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=848878&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8488780001":{"sku":"8488780001","vendor_sku":"13600","upc":"484887800012","size":"Regular Right","color":"AZALEA/MAGENTA","retail_price":"269.00","sale_price":"269.00"},"8488780002":{"sku":"8488780002","vendor_sku":"13600","upc":"484887800029","size":"Long Right","color":"AZALEA/MAGENTA","retail_price":"279.00","sale_price":"279.00"}}}
