{"sku":"841197","manufacturer_id":"MIST","brand_name":"Kneebinding","product_name":" KneeBinding Mist Downhill Ski Bindings - Women's","long_description":"The Kneebinding Mist downhill ski bindings offer an innovative solution to injury on the hill-a heelpiece that releases sideways to reduce the chance of serious knee injury. Traditional bindings feature 2 areas of release: sideways toe release in the front of the boot and vertical or forward heel release at the back of the boot. Kneebindings offer an additional dimension of sideways release in the heel, reducing the chances of strains and tears to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Resin and stainless-steel components offer high durability, excellent energy transfer and light weight. Mounting system is designed to work with the natural flex of your skis and reduces unwanted release. Hard, flat boot platforms efficiently transfer pressure from edge to edge, and toe-height adjustment eliminates play. Wide mounting platform enhances leverage on today's wide skis. The Kneebinding Mist downhill ski bindings feature a 90mm brake that fits most all-mountain skis and some all-mountain wide skis. Features 3 - 12 DIN settings.","short_description":"The Kneebinding Mist downhill ski bindings offer an innovative solution to injury on the hill-a heelpiece that releases sideways to reduce the chance of serious knee injury.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Bindings","product_group":"Downhill Ski Bindings","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s381575.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l381575.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=381575&tt=df","retail_price":"369.00","sale_price":"369.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=381575\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m381575.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=841197&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8411970001":{"sku":"8411970001","vendor_sku":"MIST","upc":"736211767318","size":"90 MM","color":"WHITE","retail_price":"369.00","sale_price":"369.00"}},"categories":["snow","ski-bindings","downhill-ski-bindings"]}
