The SmartWool PhD Cycle Ultra Light Mini bike socks feature an innovative new fabric, a more comfortable fit and smart design details that enhance performance. 4 Degree Elite Fit System improves comfort; 2 elastics provide greater stretch and recovery to keep the socks in place. Ankle bands, upper instep bands, lower instep bands and arch bands connect to the feet for a great fit and feel. ReliaWool is a patent-pending reinforcement construction that puts more wool in high wear/high impact areas to increase durability and comfort. Merino wool provides excellent temperature control and moisture management, so you're warm when it's cold and cool when it's warm. Strategically placed mesh zones provide ventilation for temperature and moisture management. Merino wool keeps your feet dry and inhospitable to bacteria that can cause odor. SmartWool socks are guaranteed not to itch and can be repeatedly machine washed and dried without shrinking. Virtually seamless toes offer durability and a low profile. PhD Cycle Ultra Light Mini bike socks are ankle height: 3.75 in. Finely stitched tops alternate 1x1 welt with single-layer 1x1 rib construction. *Discount will be applied when you check out.
