{"sku":"832807","manufacturer_id":"17274.02.103","brand_name":"Nrs","product_name":"NRS Ultra Jane Wetsuit - Women's","long_description":"Made with a convenient relief zipper, the 3mm NRS Ultra Jane wetsuit is designed to fit the female body and keep you warm in frigid waters. Specialized neoprene uses calcium carbonate instead of petroleum-it's warmer, lighter, stretchier, more buoyant and more comfortable than traditional neoprene. Stretchy 3mm neoprene provides flexible, formfitting comfort and remarkable warmth. Titanium laminate reflects body heat back to you. Lining eliminates clamminess and feels soft and warm against skin. Women-specific fit increases room across bust, tapers the legs and reduces the span across the shoulders-this wetsuit is designed for maximum comfort. 4-way stretch PowerSpan(TM) panels in the midsection improve fit and encourage unrestricted range of motion. Relief zipper lets you answer nature's call without taking off the suit. Seat and knees have been reinforced; seams are glued and blind-stitched, improving durability. Ankle zippers make slipping the NRS Ultra Jane wetsuit over your booties a breeze.","short_description":"Made with a convenient relief zipper, the 3mm NRS Ultra Jane wetsuit is designed to fit the female body and keep you warm in frigid waters.","category":"Paddling","subcategory":"Paddling Clothing","product_group":"Wetsuits","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s431711.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l431711.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=431711&tt=df","retail_price":"189.95","sale_price":"189.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=431711\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m431711.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=832807&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{},"extended_xml_attributes":"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t","categories":["paddling","paddling-clothing","wetsuits"]}
