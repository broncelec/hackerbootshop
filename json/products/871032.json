{"sku":"871032","manufacturer_id":"LSPPBRTT","brand_name":"Smith","product_name":"Smith Lowdown Slim Polarized Sunglasses - Women's","long_description":"The women's Smith Lowdown Slim Polarized Sunglasses are a trimmer version of their larger sibling, the Lowdown. Proportioned for smaller faces, the Slims still give you hot styling for casual use. Lenses vary by frame color, but both offer polarization and 100% UV ray protection, and they are highly impact resistant. Black frames have polarized gray lenses; tortoise frames have polarized brown lenses; both block 85% of visible light. Smith polarized Carbonic lenses greatly reduce glare from water, snow or asphalt and reduce eye fatigue. 53% bio-based Evolve frames are made with Rilsan(R) Clear, a light, durable, non-petroleum-based material derived from renewable, non-GMO castor plants. Smith Lowdown Slim Polarized Sunglasses have hydrophilic nosepiece and temple pads that become tackier when wet for reliable grip during exercise and hot weather.","short_description":"The women's Smith Lowdown Slim Polarized Sunglasses are a trimmer version of their larger sibling, the Lowdown.
