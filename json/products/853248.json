{"sku":"853248","manufacturer_id":"561","brand_name":"Sea To Summit","product_name":"Sea to Summit Hydraulic Dry Bag with Harness - 90L","long_description":"Designed to hold big, bulky items like sleeping bags or dry suits, the tough, waterproof 90L Sea to Summit Hydraulic dry bag lets you easily carry your gear backpack-style when you're off the water. Hydraulic dry bags are designed for heavy use and feature very tough, laminated fabric and welded seams; they also have a high resistance to UV light and cold temperatures. Harness promotes cooling airflow with EVA foam and quick-drying mesh, and it features an adjustable back length and height-adjustable sternum straps. Removable harness attches via a series of very tough, anodized aluminum buckles, and low-profile attachment points reduce snagging when harness is removed. Thermoplastic urethane (TPU) roll-top closure seals easily and provides reliable waterproof performance. Oval base resists rolling and stays where you put it. Durable attachment points secure dry bag to a pack or kayak. The 90L Sea to Summit Hydraulic dry bag is PVC free.","short_description":"Designed to hold big, bulky items like sleeping bags or dry suits, the tough, waterproof 90L Sea to Summit Hydraulic dry bag lets you easily carry your gear backpack-style when you're off the water.","category":"Paddling","subcategory":"Paddling Bags And Cases","product_group":"Dry Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s431299.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l431299.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=431299&tt=df","retail_price":"179.95","sale_price":"179.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=431299\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m431299.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=853248&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{},"extended_xml_attributes":"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t","categories":["paddling","paddling-bags-and-cases","dry-bags"]}
