{"sku":"859338","manufacturer_id":"S130303501169","brand_name":"K2","product_name":" K2 Remedy 102 Skis - Women's - 2013/2014","long_description":"An all-around twin tip for any terrain on the mountain, the women's K2 Remedy 102 skis feature stable 102mm waists to bust through crud and bidirectional sidecut you can ski forward or reverse. With a tip that's just slightly wider than the tail, the bidirectional sidecut makes it easy to ski and land jumps backward so you can jib all you want off natural features. Raised tips and tails float in soft snow, pop when doing tricks and deliver agile performance on all kinds of terrain; camber underfoot grips hardpack. K2 women's skis reduce the bulk and weight of all components to create very lightweight skis suited to the specific needs of female skiers. The stiffest core in K2's women's skis, Bioflex3 core combines aspen, paulownia and bamboo woods to deliver instant response and high durability. A fiberglass weave around the wood core provides torsional stiffness for highly responsive turning. Directional twin tip heavily favors skiing forward but allows you to ski and land jumps backward if desired. The widest point of the tips is placed further back than on other K2 skis to reduce the tendency of skis to hook in light crust and throw you off balance. Use tip and tail holes to attach skins (sold separately); remove plugs with a flathead screwdriver. 117mm waists require bindings with wide brakes. Base or topsheet color of the women's K2 Remedy 117 skis may vary from online photo.","short_description":"An all-around twin tip for any terrain on the mountain, the women's K2 Remedy 102 skis feature stable 102mm waists to bust through crud and bidirectional sidecut you can ski forward or reverse.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s442435.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l442435.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=442435&tt=df","retail_price":"599.95","sale_price":"499.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=442435\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m442435.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859338&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8593380001":{"sku":"8593380001","vendor_sku":"S130303501159","upc":"886745164531","size":"159 CM","retail_price":"499.93","sale_price":"499.93"},"8593380002":{"sku":"8593380002","vendor_sku":"S130303501169","upc":"886745164555","size":"169 CM","retail_price":"499.93","sale_price":"499.93"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
