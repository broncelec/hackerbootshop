{"sku":"866470","manufacturer_id":"14-14-2443","brand_name":"Raleigh","product_name":" Raleigh Eva 7.5 27.5 Women's Bike - 2014","long_description":"Swift on trails thanks to its 27.5 in. wheels, the women's Raleigh Eva 7.5 27.5 hardtail mountain bike keeps the ride smooth with a RockShox fork and sturdy Shimano parts. The Raleigh Eva 7.5 27.5 hardtail mountain bike is quicker and lighter than 29ers, but offers the same benefits of large-diameter wheels-more speed and better traction. Compared to 26 in. wheels, larger-diameter wheels roll over obstacles more easily so you won't stall going uphill over roots and loose soil. Butted aluminum frame features a formed down tube and CNC-machined, tapered head tube for improved strength; frame geometry is performance-tuned to better fit women. RockShox Gold 30 TK fork supplies 100mm of travel to take the harsh edges off of trail features; suspension can be locked out when not needed. Shimano drivetrain offers responsive shifting and efficient power transfer; intuitive shifters deliver snappy, precise shifts through the 27 gears. Shimano hydraulic disc brakes deliver powerful braking in all conditions. Weinmann rims are outfitted with the versatile Schwalbe Rapid Rob tires for good grip, confident cornering and fast-rolling performance. Includes a basic set of composite platform pedals (pedals not pictured). Specs on the Raleigh Eva 7.5 27.5 hardtail mountain bike are subject to change.","short_description":"Swift on trails thanks to its 27.5 in. wheels, the women's Raleigh Eva 7.5 27.5 hardtail mountain bike keeps the ride smooth with a RockShox fork and sturdy Shimano parts.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bikes","product_group":"Mountain Bikes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s374959.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l374959.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=374959&tt=df","retail_price":"999.00","sale_price":"999.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=374959\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m374959.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=866470&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8664700002":{"sku":"8664700002","vendor_sku":"14-14-2441","upc":"791964413462","size":"S","color":"SILVER/WHITE/LIME","retail_price":"999.00","sale_price":"999.00"},"8664700003":{"sku":"8664700003","vendor_sku":"14-14-2442","upc":"791964413790","size":"M","color":"SILVER/WHITE/LIME","retail_price":"999.00","sale_price":"999.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bikes","mountain-bikes"]}
