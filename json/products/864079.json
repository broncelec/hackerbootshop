{"sku":"864079","manufacturer_id":"21890-4143","brand_name":"Marmot","product_name":"Marmot Angel Fire Sleeping Bag - Women's","long_description":"Made for your 3-season backpacking adventures, the women's Marmot Angel Fire Sleeping Bag features water-resistant down insulation cleverly placed in just the right areas to keep you cozy. Designed to fit a woman's body, the bag offers increased room at the hips, decreased room at the shoulders and extra insulation in critical heat-loss areas. 650-fill-power duck down insulation is protected by a durable nylon shell with a water-repellent finish; down is treated to resist moisture to maintain warmth in damp weather. Treated down stays drier 10 times longer, maintains 150% more loft and dries 30% faster than untreated down. With a comfort European Norm (EN) rating of 26degF, the Angel Fire is a versatile bag for lightweight adventures into the mountains in spring, summer and fall. Nautilus 5-baffle hood envelopes your head in warmth; face muff allows hood to be cinched snug without chafing your face. No more midnight drawcord fumbling-smooth, flat upper cord and hard, round lower cord make hood adjustments easy. Stretch tricot baffles provide strength and durability for long bag life. Trapezoidal footbox allows down to loft fully around your feet for optimum warmth and comfort; pocket in the footbox lets you slip in a hand warmer (sold separately). Stash pocket on the top chest near hood stows nighttime essentials. Ground-level side seams keep warm air from escaping. A heat bump draft tube backs a full-length, snag-free zipper to prevent cold air from seeping through; down-filled collar adds warmth. Locking, 2-way zipper prevents bag from inadvertently opening during the night. Marmot Angel Fire sleeping bag includes stuff sack and large storage bag. European Norm (EN) is an independent third-party temperature rating, allowing accurate comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags.","short_description":"Made for your 3-season backpacking adventures, the women's Marmot Angel Fire Sleeping Bag features water-resistant down insulation cleverly placed in just the right areas to keep you cozy.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags And Accessories","product_group":"Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s463423.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l463423.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=463423&tt=df","keywords":"compact","retail_price":"259.00","sale_price":"259.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=463423\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m463423.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=864079&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8640790002":{"sku":"8640790002","vendor_sku":"21890-4143","upc":"785562485457","size":"Long Right","color":"GREEN ENVY/GREEN LIME","retail_price":"259.00","sale_price":"259.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sleeping-bags-and-accessories","sleeping-bags"]}
