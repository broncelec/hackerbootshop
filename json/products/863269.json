Lightweight, yet durable PVC lace covers help keep feet dry and warm; asymmetric zippers wrap feet and lock in heels and insteps to maximize support and control. Medial and lateral webbing reinforcements integrated into the boots' lacing system securely wrap the feet and lock down heels and insteps, maximizing support and control. Heat-moldable foam linings provide a customized fit for increased warmth and comfort. Nylon shanks in the midsoles of the Rossignol X8 skate boots provide increased support, stability and durability and help prevent foot fatigue. Polyurethane outsoles with skate-specific flex encourage powerful energy transmission.","short_description":"The high-performance Rossignol Skate X8 boots are designed for recreational and fitness-oriented skaters.
