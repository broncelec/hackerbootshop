{"sku":"778858","manufacturer_id":"G807-0215","brand_name":"Maui Jim","product_name":"Maui Jim Ho'okipa Readers Polarized Sunglasses","long_description":"Great for reading at the beach, these Maui Jim Ho'okipa sunglasses protect your eyes from the sun. Rugged polycarbonate bifocal lenses optimize your distance vision and clarify objects close in. For close-in vision choose from one of these powers: +1.50, +2.00 and +2.50. PolarizedPlus(R)2 technology, from Maui Jim, blocks glare and UV from all angles while managing harmful blue light and boosting colors for clarity and contrast. Lightweight and virtually shatterproof, polycarbonate lenses are 20 times more impact resistant than glass and one-third the weight. Front and back of lenses feature a Clearshell(R) hard coating that provides excellent scratch resistance. Extremely impact-resistant, Grilamid(TM) TR 90 lightweight nylon frames offer consistent fit and flexibility at any temperature. Rectangular lens/frame shape is ideal for round, oval, and pear face shapes. Rubber nose pads and temple ends prevent slippage. Anticorrosive nickel/silver alloy hinges enhance durability. Neutral gray lenses offer contrast and high light reduction, making them suitable for all light conditions, especially bright, direct sunlight. Bronze lenses offer excellent contrast and are suitable for low light and everyday wear. Maui Jim Ho'okipa sunglasses come with a semi-rigid case and a soft pouch for cleaning and storage.","short_description":"Great for reading at the beach, these Maui Jim Ho'okipa sunglasses protect your eyes from the sun and feature built-in bifocal lenses.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sunglasses","product_group":"Sport Sunglasses","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s422771.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l422771.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=422771&tt=df","keywords":"Cycling","retail_price":"219.00","sale_price":"219.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=422771\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m422771.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=778858&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7788580012":{"sku":"7788580012","vendor_sku":"G807-0215","upc":"603429012250","size":"1.5","color":"BLACK/GRAY","retail_price":"219.00","sale_price":"219.00"},"7788580038":{"sku":"7788580038","vendor_sku":"G807-0225","upc":"603429012274","size":"2.5","color":"BLACK/GRAY","retail_price":"219.00","sale_price":"219.00"},"7788580087":{"sku":"7788580087","vendor_sku":"H807-1020","upc":"603429012328","size":"2","color":"Tortoise/Bronze","retail_price":"219.00","sale_price":"219.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sunglasses","sport-sunglasses"]}
