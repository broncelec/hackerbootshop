{"sku":"866809","manufacturer_id":"202500","brand_name":"Thule","product_name":"Thule Chasm Duffel - Medium","long_description":"With a whale of a mouth and removable backpack straps, the rugged, weather-resistant Thule Chasm Duffel in medium is your go-to gear hauler for any adventure. Zippered top of the oversize mouth opens from one side, like a book, which makes it easy to access gear in the main compartment from just about any angle. Padded shoulder straps attach to quickly convert the duffel to a backpack; duffel straps snap down cleanly along the side of the duffel so they don't flap around. Exterior compression straps keep gear inside duffel from falling to the lower end when carried in vertical backpack mode. Interior zippered mesh pockets and an exterior zippered pocket organize smaller stuff. Padded bottom cushions your gear; locking zippers deter thieves (lock sold separately). Durable, waterproof tarpaulin fabric stands up on its own for easy packing, yet easily folds for storage. Thule Chasm Duffel in medium holds 70 liters of gear, enough for an adventure lasting a weekend or a week.","short_description":"With a whale of a mouth and removable backpack straps, the rugged, weather-resistant Thule Chasm Duffel in medium is your go-to gear hauler for any adventure.","category":"Travel And Luggage","subcategory":"Luggage","product_group":"Travel Duffels","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s463883.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l463883.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=463883&tt=df","retail_price":"134.95","sale_price":"134.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=463883\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m463883.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=866809&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8668090001":{"sku":"8668090001","vendor_sku":"202400","upc":"091021087453","color":"COBALT","retail_price":"134.95","sale_price":"134.95"},"8668090002":{"sku":"8668090002","vendor_sku":"202200","upc":"091021161252","color":"DARK SHADOW","retail_price":"134.95","sale_price":"134.95"},"8668090003":{"sku":"8668090003","vendor_sku":"202500","upc":"091021871403","color":"ZINNIA","retail_price":"134.95","sale_price":"134.95"}},"categories":["travel","luggage","travel-duffels"]}
