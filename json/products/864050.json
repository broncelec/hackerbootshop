{"sku":"864050","manufacturer_id":"1497832409","brand_name":"Mountain Hardwear","product_name":"Mountain Hardwear Lamina 20 Sleeping Bag","long_description":"The Mountain Hardwear Lamina 20 Sleeping Bag uses welded seam construction that doesn't pinch the insulation, maximizing loft, durability and warmth for backpacking in freezing weather. With a European Norm (EN) lower-limit rating of 20degF, the Lamina 20 Sleeping Bag is ideal for 3-season backpacking when temperatures drop well below freezing. Lightweight synthetic insulation has excellent loft retention, and is durable, soft and compressible. Welding stabilizes the fill without sewing through the bag, eliminating moisture penetration points and maximizing loft. Insulation is laid in a wave shape, enhancing loft and increasing thermal efficiency; offset welds increase stability and loft. Slightly wide cut gives you extra room to move inside the bag; comfort mummy cut efficiently maximizes warmth without constriction. Tough, 40-denier micro ripstop nylon shell provides durabilty; 40-denier polyester taffeta lining breathes for comfort and feels great against skin. Insulated draft tube extends to bottom of bag to eliminate cold spots. Face gasket and ergonomic draft collar seal out cold air. Full-length, 2-way zipper with locking slider is backed by wide, antisnag binding tape. Comfort footbox is shaped to allow feet to rest naturally; shape preserves loft and allows insulation to drape close to feet for warmth. Mountain Hardwear Lamina 20 Sleeping Bag comes with a stuff sack and a storage bag. Note: European Norm (EN) is an independent third-party temperature rating, allowing accurate comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags.","short_description":"The Mountain Hardwear Lamina 20 Sleeping Bag uses welded seam construction that doesn't pinch the insulation, maximizing loft, durability and warmth for backpacking in freezing weather.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags And Accessories","product_group":"Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s442335.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l442335.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=442335&tt=df","keywords":"compact","retail_price":"220.00","sale_price":"220.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=442335\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m442335.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=864050&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8640500001":{"sku":"8640500001","vendor_sku":"OU8503-409","upc":"786559901271","size":"Regular Left","color":"BLUE RIDGE","retail_price":"200.00","sale_price":"200.00"},"8640500002":{"sku":"8640500002","vendor_sku":"1497832409","upc":"786559902858","size":"Long Left","color":"BLUE RIDGE","retail_price":"220.00","sale_price":"220.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sleeping-bags-and-accessories","sleeping-bags"]}
