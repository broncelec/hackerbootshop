Aquaseal(R) urethane rubber compound provides superior adhesion, wear resistance, flexibility and waterproofing. Unaffected by heat or solvents, Aquaseal cures to a flexible thermoset rubber product. Aquaseal can be stretched and folded yet still spring back to its original shape without any damage. Cotol 240 is a urethane cure accelerator and pre-cleaner to be used in conjunction with Aquaseal. Cotol-240 cleans and prepares the surface, readying it for Aquaseal, speeding the tack time to 15 minutes and the full cure time to under two hours. COTOL-240 is also ideal for removing tar, sap, glue and other resins from various surfaces, including glass, plastic and metal. Kit includes a 1-fluid ounce tube of Aquaseal, a 1/2-fluid ounce bottle of Cotol-240 and an applicator brush.","short_description":"Repair wet suits, dry suits and all watersports products.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Gear Storage And Maintenance","product_group":"Gear Repair","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s419075.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l419075.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=419075&tt=df","retail_price":"10.95","sale_price":"10.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=419075\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m419075.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=694051&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"6940510016":{"sku":"6940510016","vendor_sku":"11114","upc":"021563111149","retail_price":"10.95","sale_price":"10.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","gear-storage-and-maintenance","gear-repair"]}
