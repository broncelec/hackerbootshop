{"sku":"731367","manufacturer_id":"C1402538","brand_name":"Continental","product_name":"Continental Contact 700 Tire","long_description":"The Continental Contact tire is a wonderful choice for all-around touring or commuting on city streets. Safety System puncture protection utilizes a polyamide nylon belt directly under the tread strip, making the tires virtually impervious to puncture and road debris. Rubber compound features a mix of carbon and silica as the main agents; carbon aids tread life while the silica boosts grip levels. Flexible shoulder lugs and fine sipes enhance grip in turns and on loose surfaces. Tire is grooved to channel water from center to side threads for improved traction on wet roads. Please note: although the tire sidewall may state \"28 x 1 1/4 x 1 3/4\" on it, please be assured that the tire will fit 700c rims.","short_description":"The Continental Contact tire is a wonderful choice for all-around touring or commuting on city streets.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Components","product_group":"Bike Tires, Tubes And Wheels","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s389139.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l389139.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=389139&tt=df","retail_price":"40.00","sale_price":"40.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=389139\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m389139.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=731367&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7313670015":{"sku":"7313670015","vendor_sku":"C1402333","upc":"051342066841","size":"700 /32","retail_price":"40.00","sale_price":"40.00"},"7313670023":{"sku":"7313670023","vendor_sku":"C1402538","size":"700 /37","retail_price":"40.00","sale_price":"40.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-components","bike-tires-tubes-and-wheels"]}
