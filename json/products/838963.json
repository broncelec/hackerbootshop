{"sku":"838963","manufacturer_id":"8205000105-600","brand_name":"Thirtytwo","product_name":"thirtytwo STW Boa Snowboard Boots - Women's - 2012/2013","long_description":"The STW Boa(R) boots from thirtytwo feature a forgiving forward and lateral flex for all-day comfort. Boa(R) standard lacing system, with ankle and cable guides along entire edge of eyestays, distributes closure force evenly for a dialed-in fit that won't loosen up. Custom-moldable Intuition Ultralon liners provide comfort, support and warmth close to the feet. Lightweight molded EVA footbeds with fuzzy topsheets provide anatomic support, cushioning and warmth; they retain 95% of their thickness over time and won't flatten out. Inner cuff lacing tightens easily with a single pull; lace locks keep laces secure, pull strap keeps laces straight and anatomic shape keeps heels down. 3D molded tongues wrap feet for easy lacing, improved fit and solid heel hold; design allows you to vary the stiffness to customize the flex and improve responsiveness. STW Boa boots have durable rubber outsoles that grip the snow and your board, and provide all-day support and comfort thanks to EVA cushions.","short_description":"The STW Boa(R) boots from thirtytwo feature a forgiving forward and lateral flex for all-day comfort.","category":"Snowboarding","subcategory":"Snowboard Boots","product_group":"Women's Snowboard Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s461631.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l461631.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=461631&tt=df","retail_price":"179.95","sale_price":"88.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=461631\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m461631.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=838963&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8389630002":{"sku":"8389630002","vendor_sku":"8205000105-600","upc":"886744029039","size":"7","color":"RED","retail_price":"88.83","sale_price":"88.83"},"8389630005":{"sku":"8389630005","vendor_sku":"8205000105-600","upc":"886744029152","size":"8.5","color":"RED","retail_price":"88.83","sale_price":"88.83"},"8389630006":{"sku":"8389630006","vendor_sku":"8205000105-600","upc":"886744029190","size":"9","color":"RED","retail_price":"88.83","sale_price":"88.83"},"8389630007":{"sku":"8389630007","vendor_sku":"8205000105-600","upc":"886744029237","size":"9.5","color":"RED","retail_price":"88.83","sale_price":"88.83"},"8389630008":{"sku":"8389630008","vendor_sku":"8205000105-600","upc":"886744028834","size":"10","color":"RED","retail_price":"88.83","sale_price":"88.83"}},"categories":["snow","snowboard-boots","womens-snowboard-boots"]}
