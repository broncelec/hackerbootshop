{"sku":"866835","manufacturer_id":"06IVOR01C","brand_name":"Klymit","product_name":"Klymit Insulated Static V Sleeping Pad","long_description":"You don't have to spend a fortune to sleep well in the great outdoors. The affordable Klymit Insulated Static V Sleeping Pad cushions you from the ground on your backpacking adventures year-round. V-shape chambers limit air movement and heat loss; chambers also help the pad stay with your every move as you sleep. Synthetic fibers add warmth, giving the pad an R-value of 4.4; most sleeping pads we sell range in R-value from 1.0 (minimally insulated) to 9.5 (well insulated). Chambers evenly distribute the air for great comfort; inflated side rails help keep you on the pad. Static V pad can be inflated with just 10 - 15 breaths; easy-to-use push valve allows for quick deflation. Rolled up, Klymit Insulated Static V sleeping pad measures 5 x 9 in. Constructed from 75-denier polyester for durability. Pad includes a stuff sack and patch kit.","short_description":"You don't have to spend a fortune to sleep well in the great outdoors.
