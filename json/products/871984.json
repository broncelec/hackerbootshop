Innovative system joins pieces together, creating a stable, rigid kayak that you'll love to paddle in light surf, calm rivers and flatwater. Assembly happens in a flash: just align the sections, feed a strap into a ratchet, and ratchet down straps on either side of the cockpit. The Martini GTX stands up to rough treatment thanks to a UV-resistant, single-layer polyethylene hull. Equipped with a comfortable AIR seat with backrest; seat cover is made of durable, comfortable honeycomb-patterned material with meshlike fabric that's laminated over EVA foam. Bungee cords offer storage, and \"Fish-O-Meter\" hash marks on hull measure your catch.
