{"sku":"857624","manufacturer_id":"10544100402","brand_name":"Burton","product_name":" Burton Freestyle Snowboard Bindings - 2013/2014","long_description":"Easy to ride thanks to a forgiving flex, the Burton Freestyle bindings help you progress from falling leaf on the bunny hill to ripping turns anywhere on the mountain. Single-component, lightweight yet tough, polycarbonate baseplates create moderate flex and consistent response for a versatile ride on all terrain. Single-component highbacks are responsive; minimized design saves precious weight, and they rotate to follow your natural leg contours, optimizing comfort and power. Tool-free, forward-lean micro adjustment lets you dial in and lock forward your lean angle on the fly; forward lean adjusts independently of side-to-side rotation. Highbacks feature Over The Top padding for extra cushioning that won't bite your calves. FullBED cushioning covers the entire baseplate to maximize comfort and minimize fatigue; extendable toe ramps reduce toe drag and increase responsiveness. Lushstrap(TM) padded, precurved ankle straps feature telescoping and multi-location adjustability; Adaptastrap toe straps conform around boots for a solid hold. Smooth Glide(TM) buckles are strong and easy to grab for quick closure and release. Burton Freestyle bindings are compatible with traditional 3D(TM), 4x4 bolt patterns and The Channel.","short_description":"Easy to ride thanks to a forgiving flex, the Burton Freestyle bindings help you progress from falling leaf on the bunny hill to ripping turns anywhere on the mountain.","category":"Snowboarding","subcategory":"Snowboard Bindings","product_group":"Strap Snowboard Bindings","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s383011.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l383011.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=383011&tt=df","retail_price":"129.95","sale_price":"90.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=383011\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m383011.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=857624&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8576240001":{"sku":"8576240001","vendor_sku":"10544100402","upc":"886888498098","size":"M","color":"COBALT","retail_price":"90.83","sale_price":"90.83"},"8576240002":{"sku":"8576240002","vendor_sku":"10544100402","upc":"886888498081","size":"L","color":"COBALT","retail_price":"90.83","sale_price":"90.83"}},"categories":["snow","snowboard-bindings","strap-snowboard-bindings"]}
