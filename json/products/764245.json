{"sku":"764245","manufacturer_id":"1258","brand_name":"Keen","product_name":" Keen Voyageur Cross-Training Shoes - Men's","long_description":"Like its cousin, Targhee, these Keen Voyageur hiking shoes offer the same 4-wheel drive traction and stability minus the waterproof barrier. Leather uppers with polyester mesh ventilation windows offer durability, flexibility and breathability for comfort on the go. Polyester linings wick moisture away from your feet and dry quickly to keep feet comfortable and dry. Secure-fit lace capture system with sturdy leather eyelets and heel wrap help lock feet to footbeds for increased support. Webbing pull loops at heel and tongue allow easy entry/exit; padded, gusseted tongues keep out debris and moisture while relieving lace pressure. Patented rubber toe bumpers protect feet and uppers from bumps and abrasion. Removable Metatomical EVA footbeds are custom shaped to provide ample cushioning and arch support; can also accommodate orthotics. Compression-molded EVA midsoles offer shock-absorption and padding for all-day comfort. Supportive ESS plastic shanks provide torsional stability and protection from uneven and rocky terrain. S3 (shock, suspension, stability) heel support structure supports the feet on impact, dissipates shock and reduces the chance of twisting an ankle. Nonmarking carbon rubber outsoles with aggressive 4mm multidirectional lugs for long-wearing durability and superb terrain bite. Fit tip: runs true to size.","short_description":"Like its cousin, Targhee, these Keen Voyageur hiking shoes offer the same 4-wheel drive traction and stability minus the waterproof barrier.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Men's Footwear","product_group":"Men's Shoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s385571.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l385571.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=385571&tt=df","keywords":"trail","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=385571\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m385571.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=764245&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7642450048":{"sku":"7642450048","vendor_sku":"1258","upc":"871209299898","size":"9","color":"BLACK OLIVE/INCA GOLD","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"7642450055":{"sku":"7642450055","vendor_sku":"1258","upc":"871209299928","size":"9.5","color":"Black Olive/Inca Gold","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"7642450063":{"sku":"7642450063","vendor_sku":"1258","upc":"871209299959","size":"10","color":"BLACK OLIVE/INCA GOLD","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"7642450071":{"sku":"7642450071","vendor_sku":"1258","upc":"871209299980","size":"10.5","color":"BLACK OLIVE/INCA GOLD","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"7642450089":{"sku":"7642450089","vendor_sku":"1258","upc":"871209300013","size":"11","color":"BLACK OLIVE/INCA GOLD","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"7642450097":{"sku":"7642450097","vendor_sku":"1258","upc":"871209300044","size":"11.5","color":"BLACK OLIVE/INCA GOLD","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"7642450105":{"sku":"7642450105","vendor_sku":"1258","upc":"871209300075","size":"12","color":"BLUE","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"7642450113":{"sku":"7642450113","vendor_sku":"1258","upc":"871209300105","size":"13","color":"BLUE","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"}},"categories":["footwear","mens-footwear","mens-shoes"]}
