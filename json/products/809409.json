{"sku":"809409","manufacturer_id":"7.61E+12","brand_name":"Mammut","product_name":" Mammut Supersafe EVO COATINGfiinish superDRY 10.2mm x 60m Dry Rope","long_description":"Well suited for sport and trad climbing, the Mammut Supersafe EVO 10.2mm x 60m climbing rope is treated to minimize friction and repel water and dirt so it can withstand regular use in the outdoors. COATINGfinish(TM) process uses a Teflon(R) coating to reduce friction and allow fibers to glide against each other for optimal load distribution and durability. superDRY(TM) sheath and core treatment protects against water and dirt, thereby increasing the durability of the rope; also maintains smooth handling characteristics. Kernmantle design combines a durable braided sheath with a shock-absorbent core for protection from fall forces. 10.2mm diameter holds up to regular use at the crag while keeping the rope light enough so you can haul it into a climb. 7.9kN impact force reduces impact on climber, gear and anchor compared to ropes of higher kN ratings. 60m length allows long leads and rappels. Middle of the rope is marked with a black bar to facilitate rappels. Rope comes lap coiled, eliminating the time-consuming task of uncoiling a new rope to keep it from becoming twisted. Mammut Supersafe EVO climbing rope meets UIAA tests for falls, impact force and elongation.","short_description":"Well suited for sport and trad climbing, the Mammut Supersafe EVO 10.2mm x 60m climbing rope is treated to minimize friction and repel water and dirt so it can withstand regular use in the outdoors.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Ropes","product_group":"Single Ropes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s180047.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l180047.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=180047&tt=df","keywords":"dynamic","retail_price":"269.95","sale_price":"269.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=180047\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m180047.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=809409&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8094090019":{"sku":"8094090019","vendor_sku":"7.61319E+12","size":"10.2 Mm X 60 M","color":"ORANGE","retail_price":"269.95","sale_price":"269.95"}},"categories":["climbing","climbing-ropes","single-ropes"]}
