{"sku":"828434","manufacturer_id":"033748-771-1-S/","brand_name":"Osprey","product_name":" Osprey Kestrel 48 Pack","long_description":"The Osprey Kestrel 48 pack sports a sleek, technical design with an adjustable torso and lightweight materials, making it an ideal pack for overnight or weekend trips. Mesh-covered, die-cut EVA hipbelt saves weight and enhances breathability. Pack fits a wide variety of backs thanks to rip-and-stick, torso-length adjustability: just rip it, adjust it and stick it. Lightweight AirScape(TM) back panel features ridge-molded foam with channels covered in mesh to allow airflow. LightWire(TM) peripheral-hoop alloy frame and HDPE framesheet provide a flexible and light structure. Top-loading design features a sewn-on lid with a pocket that offers accessible gear storage. Externally accessible lower compartment accommodates a sleeping bag. Stow-On-The-Go(TM) trekking pole attachment lets you stow and remove poles (not included) while still wearing pack. Poles tuck away between your arm and pack; adjustable shockcord on left-hand shoulder strap and a side loop hold poles in tightly. Front and side stretch-woven pockets are ideal for stashing a jacket and other often-used gear. Hipbelt features 2 zippered pockets for stashing a digital camera and snacks. Hydration-compatible design features reservoir sleeve and drink tube exit port for on-the-go hydration (reservoir sold separately). 2 ice axe loops with bungee tool tie-offs let you lash extra gear outside. Dual sleeping pad straps on the pack's base adjust easily to hold a variety of shapes and sizes of pads. Side compression straps let you cinch down loads for jostle-free carrying. The Osprey Kestrel 48 pack features an integrated raincover that pulls out in a flash to protect contents from sudden downpours.","short_description":"The Osprey Kestrel 48 pack sports a sleek, technical design with an adjustable torso and lightweight materials, making it an ideal pack for overnight or weekend trips.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Backpacks","product_group":"Backpacking Packs","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s410487.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l410487.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=410487&tt=df","keywords":"multiday","retail_price":"179.95","sale_price":"179.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=410487\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m410487.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=828434&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8284340001":{"sku":"8284340001","vendor_sku":"033748-315-1-S/","upc":"877257011888","size":"S/M","color":"FIRE RED","retail_price":"179.95","sale_price":"179.95"},"8284340002":{"sku":"8284340002","vendor_sku":"033748-315-2-M/","upc":"877257011895","size":"M/L","color":"FIRE RED","retail_price":"179.95","sale_price":"179.95"},"8284340003":{"sku":"8284340003","vendor_sku":"033748-657-1-S/","upc":"877257011925","size":"S/M","color":"TARN BLUE","retail_price":"179.95","sale_price":"179.95"},"8284340004":{"sku":"8284340004","vendor_sku":"033748-657-2-M/","upc":"877257011932","size":"M/L","color":"TARN BLUE","retail_price":"179.95","sale_price":"179.95"},"8284340005":{"sku":"8284340005","vendor_sku":"033748-771-1-S/","upc":"877257011949","size":"S/M","color":"CONIFER GREEN","retail_price":"179.95","sale_price":"179.95"},"8284340006":{"sku":"8284340006","vendor_sku":"033748-771-2-M/","upc":"877257011956","size":"M/L","color":"CONIFER GREEN","retail_price":"179.95","sale_price":"179.95"}}}
