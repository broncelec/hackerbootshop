{"sku":"859405","manufacturer_id":"FCCA007","brand_name":"Look","product_name":" Look PX 10 Wide Downhill Ski Bindings","long_description":"With an intermediate skill level DIN range of 3 - 10 and a design that releases in four separate directions, the Look PX 10 Wide downhill ski bindings enhance protection from unexpected falls. Toepieces provide multidirectional release for optimum protection in all types of falls; 4 contact points between the toepieces and the boots ensure effective power transfer. PX 10 wide bindings feature 45mm of elastic travel at the heel, which absorbs shock and allows a lower setting of release values. Antifriction devices reduce sliding between the boots and the bindings and keep release consistent. Look PX 10 Wide downhill ski bindings come with 100mm brakes, which are wide enough to fit most all-mountain wide skis.","short_description":"With an intermediate skill level DIN range of 3 - 10 and a design that releases in four separate directions, the Look PX 10 Wide downhill ski bindings enhance protection from unexpected falls.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Bindings","product_group":"Downhill Ski Bindings","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s381587.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l381587.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=381587&tt=df","retail_price":"179.95","sale_price":"125.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=381587\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m381587.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859405&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8594050001":{"sku":"8594050001","vendor_sku":"FCCA007","color":"BLUE GREEN","retail_price":"125.93","sale_price":"125.93"}},"categories":["snow","ski-bindings","downhill-ski-bindings"]}
