{"sku":"796338","manufacturer_id":"SP-E101-BK","brand_name":"Thomson","product_name":" THOMSON Elite Seatpost - 27.2mm","long_description":"The THOMSON Elite 27.2mm seatpost offers superior strength and minimum weight. Tube and head are integral-machined from a single piece of high-strength 7000-series aluminum, allowing higher strength at lower weights. Natural ellipse bore inside tube provides optimum strength-to-weight ratio. Long 1.6 in. (41 mm) seat rail grip length helps prevent the seat rail from bending due to impact loads. Design incorporates a bending fuse to prevent catastrophic failure. Clamp, head and upper tube are strong enough to withstand 350 foot-pounds of torque. Impact absorbing clamps; clamps, head and assembly will spread and flex on impact to protect seat, rails, seatpost and rider. Infinite tilt adjustment; -5deg and +29deg. Low-profile clamps prevent seat interference; swivel nuts are down between the seat rails. Adjustments can be made to the tilt of the seat without moving the seat forwards or backwards. Easy on seats; allows seat to survive heavy impact loads without bending your rails. Every component of the THOMSON seatpost is 100% American made; this includes all fasteners and forgings.","short_description":"The THOMSON Elite 27.2mm seatpost offers superior strength and minimum weight.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Components","product_group":"Bike Saddles And Seatposts","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s441443.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l441443.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=441443&tt=df","retail_price":"99.50","sale_price":"99.50","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=441443\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m441443.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=796338&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7963380014":{"sku":"7963380014","vendor_sku":"SP-E101-BK","upc":"875850000575","size":"330 Mm","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"99.50","sale_price":"99.50"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-components","bike-saddles-and-seatposts"]}
