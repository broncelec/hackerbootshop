{"sku":"860320","manufacturer_id":"113300.186","brand_name":"Volkl","product_name":" Volkl Nunataq Telemark / Randonee Skis - 2013/2014","long_description":"The Volkl Nunataq telemark/randonee skis feature a shape of 139/107/123 for the backcountry skier seeking a rockered touring ski that will float through the deep powder descents. Construction features a multilayer core of poplar and beech wood that is wrapped in composite and fiberglass near the middle of the ski to add strength and snap. Full rocker features a smooth, gradual bend from the tips to the tails for great maneuverability in soft snow while also delivering graceful arcs on groomed snow. Flex and sidecut are matched with the full rocker profile to give you uninterrupted edge contact-the more you put the ski on edge, the more effective the edge becomes. Holes in the front of the skis function as skin attachment points for Volkl-brand skins (not included). Non-Volkl-brand skins (sold separately) can also be used with the Nunataq skis. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.","short_description":"The Volkl Nunataq telemark/randonee skis feature a shape of 139/107/123 for the backcountry skier seeking a rockered touring ski that will float through the deep powder descents.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Backcountry Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s381815.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l381815.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=381815&tt=df","retail_price":"699.00","sale_price":"699.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=381815\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m381815.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=860320&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8603200001":{"sku":"8603200001","vendor_sku":"113300.17","upc":"821264527481","size":"170 CM","retail_price":"699.00","sale_price":"699.00"},"8603200003":{"sku":"8603200003","vendor_sku":"113300.186","upc":"821264527504","size":"186 CM","retail_price":"699.00","sale_price":"699.00"}},"categories":["snow","skis","backcountry-skis"]}
