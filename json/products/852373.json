{"sku":"852373","manufacturer_id":"301","brand_name":"Sea To Summit","product_name":" Sea to Summit Delta Bowl with Lid","long_description":"There's a spot in your pack for the lightweight Sea To Summit Delta bowl with Lid. It's low volume and super tough, and the included lid seals tightly to keep the kit together. Perfect for rehydrating freeze-dried foods with hot water, the food-grade nylon has a high melting point and stands up to the abuses of camping. Innovative hex pattern base reduces overall weight and helps keep the bowl cool enough to handle even when eating hot foods. Thumb grip on side of bowl keeps your fingers out of your food, and it doubles as a hanging loop for a carabiner. Steep side walls keep food and liquids from slopping over the edge. Lid seals tightly and allows storage of small items inside the kit such as eating utensils, a headlamp or packets of hot cocoa (not included). Sea To Summit Delta bowl with Lid features measurement increments on the inside to help you prepare meals and portion food.","short_description":"There's a spot in your pack for the lightweight Sea To Summit Delta bowl with Lid.
