Three different ways to wear the system: wear shell jacket and zip-in liner jacket together for maximum protection or wear either piece on its own as weather warrants. HyVent(TM) 2-layer construction is waterproof, windproof and breathable; fully sealed seams prevent moisture from seeping through. Powder skirt with gripping elastic keeps snow out; snaps let you integrate the powder skirt with compatible pants by The North Face (sold separately). Zip chest media pocket; dual flap chest pockets; wrist pocket with goggles cloth; internal goggles pocket. Cinch adjustable hem and rip-and-stick wrist cuffs with thumbholes help seal out cold air and retain valuable warmth; underarm vents let you control airflow and your comfort.

Liner jacket has handwarmer pockets and rib-knit collar and cuffs. Easy zip-in system mates the liner jacket and shell jacket together for added warmth and allows easy reach-in access to the shell's interior features.","short_description":"Stay dry, stay warm and adjust to the conditions with the versatile Gilmore Triclimate 3-in-1 insulated jacket by The North Face.
