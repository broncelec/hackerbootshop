Striker handle is 46% bigger than on the original, making it easy to grip; 33% larger ferrocerium rod allows for more than 3,000 strikes, as compared to 1,000 on the original. Ferrocerium rod stows inside the knurled body; unscrew the rod, flip it around and screw it back on and it's ready for use. Rod works when dry or wet-simply scrape it with the tungsten carbide striker to send sparks flying; provides more than 3,000 strikes and can be replaced. NanoStriker XL is 3.6 in. long when stowed and 4.2 in. long when in use. O-rings keep moisture from getting inside and onto the striker and the rod. Exotac NanoStriker XL(TM) firestarter includes a split ring for carrying keys, a lanyard, an extra set of O-rings and an instruction manual.","short_description":"The Exotac NanoStriker XL(TM) firestarter includes a larger rod and handle than the original NanoStriker for improved ease of use, yet it still is small enough to be carried as a keychain.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Health And Safety","product_group":"Fire-Starting Gear","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s420107.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l420107.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=420107&tt=df","retail_price":"32.95","sale_price":"32.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=420107\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m420107.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=842504&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8425040001":{"sku":"8425040001","vendor_sku":"003100-OD","upc":"091037401489","color":"OLIVE DRAB","retail_price":"32.95","sale_price":"32.95"}}}
