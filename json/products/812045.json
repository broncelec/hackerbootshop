{"sku":"812045","manufacturer_id":"MTI-502A-0BR03","brand_name":"Mti","product_name":"MTI underDOG Flotation Vest for Dogs","long_description":"The MTI underDOG Flotation Vest for dogs positions most of its buoyancy under the chest area, supporting a dog's natural swim posture and making its instinctive swim motions more effective. Traditional flotation vests pull dogs' hindquarters up and position their heads closer to the water; underDOG releases the neck and lets the head ride higher above the water. 4 adjustment points, ventilated mesh across the back and an adjustable mesh bridge between the collar and the body help ensure great fit and comfort. Reflective trim accents the sides and top for enhanced visibility in low light; reinforced carry handles and leash attachment point help you keep your dog under control. The MTI underDOG Flotation Vest for dogs is made of durable nylon and Cordura(R) fabric in the same factory that makes MTI life jackets for people.","short_description":"The MTI underDOG Flotation Vest for dogs positions most of its buoyancy under the chest area, supporting a dog's natural swim posture and making its instinctive swim motions more effective.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Dog Gear","product_group":"Dog Safety Gear","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s463379.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l463379.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=463379&tt=df","keywords":"vest","retail_price":"50.00","sale_price":"50.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=463379\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m463379.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=812045&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8120450002":{"sku":"8120450002","vendor_sku":"MTI-502A-0BR03","upc":"762894033532","size":"S","color":"RED/BLUE","retail_price":"50.00","sale_price":"50.00"},"8120450003":{"sku":"8120450003","vendor_sku":"MTI-502A-0BR04","upc":"762894033549","size":"M","color":"RED/BLUE","retail_price":"50.00","sale_price":"50.00"},"8120450004":{"sku":"8120450004","vendor_sku":"MTI-502A-0BR05","upc":"762894033556","size":"L","color":"RED/BLUE","retail_price":"50.00","sale_price":"50.00"},"8120450005":{"sku":"8120450005","vendor_sku":"MTI-502A-0BR06","upc":"762894033563","size":"XL","color":"RED/BLUE","retail_price":"50.00","sale_price":"50.00"},"8120450013":{"sku":"8120450013","vendor_sku":"MTI-502A-GR20*","upc":"762894027302","size":"Xs","color":"RED/MANGO","retail_price":"36.93","sale_price":"36.93"},"8120450021":{"sku":"8120450021","vendor_sku":"MTI-502A-GR20*","upc":"762894027319","size":"S","color":"RED/MANGO","retail_price":"36.93","sale_price":"36.93"},"8120450047":{"sku":"8120450047","vendor_sku":"MTI-502A-GR20*","upc":"762894027333","size":"L","color":"RED/MANGO","retail_price":"36.93","sale_price":"36.93"},"8120450054":{"sku":"8120450054","vendor_sku":"MTI-502A-GR20*","upc":"762894027340","size":"Xl","color":"RED/MANGO","retail_price":"36.93","sale_price":"36.93"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","dog-gear","dog-safety-gear"]}
