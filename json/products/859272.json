{"sku":"859272","manufacturer_id":"S12712,46","brand_name":"Fischer","product_name":" Fischer BCX 675 75mm Backcountry Ski Boots","long_description":"The Fischer BCX 675 75mm Backcountry ski boots help you tour and turn with confidence in demanding off-trail terrain with their rugged soles, warm insulation and external stabilizing cuffs. Hinged stabilizing cuffs provide robust side-to-side support without inhibiting front and back movements; use the rip-and-stick straps to adjust the fit around the ankles. Lightweight Thinsulate(R)/wool lining insulates efficiently even when wet and breathes to regulate temperature for outstanding comfort in wide-ranging conditions. Nubuck leather uppers stand up to wear and tear on the trail and add warmth and protection. External rip-and-stick heel straps let you customize the heel width for optimum hold and fit. Large entry loops back and front, plus wide openings, reduce the energy required to get in and out of boots, especially nice when wearing warm/bulky winter clothing. Rugged, non-slip Vibram(R) 75mm soles fit 3-pin backcountry bindings. Fischer BCX 675 backcountry ski boots are built with a comfortable, roomy last; a stiff flex offers support and control in variable terrain and changing snow conditions.","short_description":"The Fischer BCX 675 75mm Backcountry ski boots help you tour and turn with confidence in demanding off-trail terrain with their rugged soles, warm insulation and external stabilizing cuffs.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Cross-Country Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382399.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382399.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382399&tt=df","retail_price":"199.95","sale_price":"199.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382399\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382399.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859272&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8592720003":{"sku":"8592720003","vendor_sku":"S12712,40","size":"40 EU","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"199.95","sale_price":"199.95"},"8592720004":{"sku":"8592720004","vendor_sku":"S12712,41","size":"41 EU","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"199.95","sale_price":"199.95"},"8592720005":{"sku":"8592720005","vendor_sku":"S12712,42","size":"42 EU","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"199.95","sale_price":"199.95"},"8592720006":{"sku":"8592720006","vendor_sku":"S12712,43","size":"43 EU","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"199.95","sale_price":"199.95"},"8592720007":{"sku":"8592720007","vendor_sku":"S12712,44","size":"44 EU","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"199.95","sale_price":"199.95"},"8592720009":{"sku":"8592720009","vendor_sku":"S12712,46","size":"46 EU","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"199.95","sale_price":"199.95"}}}
