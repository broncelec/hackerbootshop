{"sku":"794739","manufacturer_id":"2031469","brand_name":"Giro","product_name":"Giro Rascal Bike Helmet - Kids'","long_description":"Kids don't think twice about fit systems and tech specs-they just want to ride! The Giro Rascal bike helmet has an easy fit system that allows your little rider to be on his or her way quickly. One Step(TM) fit system allows fast and intuitive fitting; simply put the helmet on, snap the pinch-free buckle and off they go. One Step ensures the helmet is both properly fitted and properly worn; it self adjusts to the correct size without yanking, adjusting and fussing after the initial fitting. In-mold helmet construction bonds a flyweight shell to high-performance expanded polystyrene foam liner for an excellent strength-to-weight ratio. 12 vents allow cool, fresh air to circulate over and around child's head; front vents feature a net liner to keep big bugs out. Built-in visor keeps sun out of child's eyes. Integrated dual LED taillights add visibility; mom and dad can easily click them on and off. Small/Medium fits 18 - 19.75 in. (46 - 50 cm) head circumferences, and Medium/Large fits 19.75 - 21.5 in. (50 - 54 cm).","short_description":"Kids don't think twice about fit systems and tech specs-they just want to ride!
