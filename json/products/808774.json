GXP system captures the left-side bearing between the spindle and the left crankarm while the drive-side bearing floats axially on the spindle. This eliminates the necessity to side load bearings during adjustment, simplifying the installation process. Gutter Seal design enhances protection of the sealed cartridge bearings from the elements for improved longevity. Seal drag has also been reduced for better efficiency.
