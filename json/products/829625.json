Water resistant to 50m (165 ft.), 910XT handles open-water and pool swimming; watch measures swimming distance, identifies strokes and tracks strokes and pool lengths. Computes your \"Swim Golf\" (SWOLF) score, which is determined by adding the number of strokes taken per lap to the time it took to swim the lap, to help improve efficiency.

GPS also captures the path you travel while swimming in open water so you can analyze it later to help improve your technique.
