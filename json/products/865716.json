Hydroformed and butted 6061 aluminum frame is lightweight and sturdy; geometry has been fine-tuned to maximize suspension performance. Fox 32 Float 29 Evolution CTD Air suspension fork has 100mm of air-sprung travel; Fox Float CTD rear shock has a progressive damping curve and excellent sensitivity. TwinLoc system provides remote, bar-top control of suspension travel and lockout, letting you customize performance on the fly. 3 TwinLoc settings supply full travel front and rear, Traction mode (full travel on fork with limited rear suspension), and lockout for both front and rear.
