Let them forget about the weight on their backs and focus on day after day of outdoor adventure. The same quality, fit and comfort found in adult Gregory packs are built into this long-lasting and adjustable pack for youth. Adjustable suspension allows the Wander pack to extend the waist size and torso length, helping maintain a perfect fit as young users grow. Fully adjustable, padded hipbelt and shoulder straps help ensure proper load transfer away from the back and onto the hips for proper load carry. Air-mesh lining on the back panel, shoulder straps and hipbelt helps ensure added comfort, breathability and moisture management. Simple and light wire wishbone frame provides effective load transfer to the lumbar; frame directly integrates with the lumbar pad for efficient load transfer to the hips. Ample main compartment features both a traditional top with a quick-draw closure and a large, duffle-style U-zip front opening for easy loading and access to gear. Trekking pole attachment and twin daisy chains allow gear to be attached to the exterior of the pack; attachment loops on the harness make easy access to on-trail accessories. The Gregory Wander 70 pack features a raincover, 2 bottle pockets, zippered stash pocket, security pocket in the lid and hydration compatibility (reservoir sold separately).","short_description":"The Gregory Wander 70 pack offers a full-featured, full-size gear hauler for backpackers age 10 and up.
