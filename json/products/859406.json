{"sku":"859406","manufacturer_id":"FCCA006","brand_name":"Look","product_name":" Look PX 12 XXL Downhill Ski Bindings","long_description":"With DIN settings from 3.5 - 12 and a design that releases in four separate directions to enhance protection, the advanced Look PX 12 XXL bindings let you charge over the lip without hesitation. Toepieces provide multidirectional release for optimum protection in all types of falls; 4 contact points between the toepieces and the boots ensure effective power transfer. PX 12 wide bindings feature 25mm of vertical travel at the heel and 45mm of lateral travel at the toe, which absorbs shock and allows a lower setting of release values. Antifriction devices reduce sliding between the boots and the bindings and keep release consistent. Look PX 12 XXL downhill ski bindings come with 115mm brakes, which are wide enough to fit many powder skis.","short_description":"With DIN settings from 3.5 - 12 and a design that releases in four separate directions to enhance protection, the advanced Look PX 12 XXL bindings let you charge over the lip without hesitation.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Bindings","product_group":"Downhill Ski Bindings","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s381591.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l381591.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=381591&tt=df","retail_price":"199.95","sale_price":"139.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=381591\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m381591.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859406&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8594060001":{"sku":"8594060001","vendor_sku":"FCCA006","color":"BLUE GREEN","retail_price":"139.93","sale_price":"139.93"}}}
