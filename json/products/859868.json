{"sku":"859868","manufacturer_id":"RICWA45","brand_name":"Rossignol","product_name":"Rossignol X5 OT FW Cross-Country Ski Boots - Women's","long_description":"The women's Rossignol X5 OT FW off-track touring boots offer comfort and warmth for recreational cross-country skiers and active winter enthusiasts who like to explore on and off the trail. Women-specific design provides a more precise fit for narrow feet and includes soft fleecy Polartec(R) linings that enhance warmth. Thinsulate(TM) polyester/thermo-moldable foam insulation supplies non-bulky warmth and comfort even when damp; after a few days of skiing the foam molds to your feet. Hinged cuffs with rip-and-stick power straps provide torsional stability and control without hindering movement. Reinforced toe boxes, midsoles and heel counters deliver increased support, stability and durability for exploring on and off-trail. External cuff gaiters help keep snow from getting inside the boots. Medial and lateral webbing reinforcements integrated into the boots' lacing system securely wrap the feet and lock down heels and insteps, maximizing support and control. Snow and ice rolls off the durable Cordura(R) lace covers of the Rossignol X5 OT FW boots and helps keep feet warmer.","short_description":"The women's Rossignol X5 OT FW off-track touring boots offer comfort and warmth for recreational cross-country skiers and active winter enthusiasts who like to explore on and off the trail.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Cross-Country Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382411.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382411.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382411&tt=df","retail_price":"129.95","sale_price":"116.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382411\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382411.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859868&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8598680001":{"sku":"8598680001","vendor_sku":"RICWA45","size":"37 EU","color":"BLACK/ORANGE/WHITE","retail_price":"116.93","sale_price":"116.93"},"8598680002":{"sku":"8598680002","vendor_sku":"RICWA45","size":"38 EU","color":"BLACK/ORANGE/WHITE","retail_price":"116.93","sale_price":"116.93"},"8598680003":{"sku":"8598680003","vendor_sku":"RICWA45","size":"39 EU","color":"BLACK/ORANGE/WHITE","retail_price":"116.93","sale_price":"116.93"},"8598680004":{"sku":"8598680004","vendor_sku":"RICWA45","size":"40 EU","color":"BLACK/ORANGE/WHITE","retail_price":"116.93","sale_price":"116.93"},"8598680005":{"sku":"8598680005","vendor_sku":"RICWA45","size":"41 EU","color":"BLACK/ORANGE/WHITE","retail_price":"116.93","sale_price":"116.93"},"8598680006":{"sku":"8598680006","vendor_sku":"RICWA45","size":"42 EU","color":"BLACK/ORANGE/WHITE","retail_price":"116.93","sale_price":"116.93"}},"categories":["snow","ski-boots","crosscountry-ski-boots"]}
