{"sku":"864316","manufacturer_id":"APPPGNMB","brand_name":"Smith","product_name":"Smith Approach Polarized Interchangeable Sunglasses - Men's","long_description":"A do-it-all pair of polarized shades for reducing glare when running, riding or hiking, the Smith Approach interchangeable sunglasses offer lightweight frames and a set of lenses for any light level. Polarized lenses reduce 99% of visible glare from water, snow, sand and pavement for increased visual acuity and decreased eye strain. Each frame includes 1 set of polarized lenses (tint depends on frame color) and 2 additional sets of lenses for a total of 3 sets of lenses. Whiskey frames feature polarized brown lenses that block reflected glare while providing increased depth perception and reducing eye strain in bright light. Matte Graphite frames include polarized platinum (gray-tinted) lenses that allow objects to be seen in their most natural state without color distortion in bright light. Frames include 2 additional sets of lenses: Ignitor (red-tinted) for optimal depth perception in medium light/overcast conditions and clear for dim light. Frames are made from a bio-plastic derived from non-GMO castor seeds and lightweight nylon for a resilient, consistent fit. Scratch- and impact-resistant Carbonic lenses use Smith Tapered Lens Technology(TM) to provide distortion-free vision. Tapered Lens Technology progressively tapers the lens so that light travels through without distortion-what you see is what you get. Hydrophilic Megol(TM) nosepiece and temple ends become tackier when wet for reliable grip during exercise and hot weather. Smith Approach Polarized interchangeable sunglasses have a medium fit with medium coverage.","short_description":"A do-it-all pair of polarized shades for reducing glare when running, riding or hiking, the Smith Approach interchangeable sunglasses offer lightweight frames and a set of lenses for any light level.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sunglasses","product_group":"Sport Sunglasses","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s444575.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l444575.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=444575&tt=df","keywords":"Cycling","retail_price":"179.00","sale_price":"179.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=444575\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m444575.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=864316&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8643160003":{"sku":"8643160003","vendor_sku":"APPPGNMB","upc":"715757447472","size":"POLAR GRAY GREEN","color":"MATTE BLACK","retail_price":"179.00","sale_price":"179.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sunglasses","sport-sunglasses"]}
