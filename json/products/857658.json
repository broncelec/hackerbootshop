{"sku":"857658","manufacturer_id":"10563100001","brand_name":"Burton","product_name":"Burton Genesis EST Snowboard Bindings - 2013/2014","long_description":"The Burton Genesis EST(R) bindings are built for big-mountain riding thanks to the full EVA baseplate pads that soften landings and the suspension highbacks that move with you. The EST platform offers endless stance options and a truer flex from your board; plus, with personalized cushioning options, you'll enjoy ultimate feel and control. Hinge technology allows your heels and the baseplates to move independently for a never-before-felt lateral flex; the Hinge flexes dynamically with your legs. Fiber/nylon EST baseplates have interchangeable ShredBED 3.0(TM) dual-density EVA cushioning; optional toe ramps heighten toe-edge response while reducing toe drag. Zero-Lean Kickback Hammock highbacks feature tool-free forward lean adjustment and provide increased response and reduced vibration while your heel is cradled in suspension. New Double Take buckles feature polished, chrome-plated aluminum and lightweight polycarbonate levers to give you buttery smooth and reliable ratcheting power. Burton Genesis EST bindings feature new Hammockstrap ankle straps and lightweight Gettagrip Capstrap(TM) toe straps. 2014 Genesis EST bindings will fit 2011 through 2014 Channel Boards with the included black hardware.","short_description":"The Burton Genesis EST(R) bindings are built for big-mountain riding thanks to the full EVA baseplate pads that soften landings and the suspension highbacks that move with you.","category":"Snowboarding","subcategory":"Snowboard Bindings","product_group":"Strap Snowboard Bindings","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s383023.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l383023.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=383023&tt=df","retail_price":"329.95","sale_price":"230.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=383023\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m383023.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=857658&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8576580002":{"sku":"8576580002","vendor_sku":"10563100001","upc":"886888499552","size":"L","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"230.83","sale_price":"230.83"}},"categories":["snow","snowboard-bindings","strap-snowboard-bindings"]}
