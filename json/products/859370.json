{"sku":"859370","manufacturer_id":"RACQJ01","brand_name":"Rossignol","product_name":"Rossignol Sin 7 Skis - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"The lightweight, highly responsive Rossignol Sin 7 skis use 98mm waists, a rockered profile designed for powder and lightweight construction to take on any conditions Mother Nature can cook up. Float like a feather on top of deep snow thanks to the rockered tips and tails; redesigned Powder Turn rocker minimizes the tendency of tips to flap at high speeds. Standard camber underfoot offers tenacious edge-grip on hardpack; there's more than enough camber to enjoy carving on groomers. Wood core creates a light and lively ski with excellent ski-to-snow feel and high durability. You'll notice remarkable edge grip and playful responsiveness thanks to a sidecut that's centered below the bindings. The Rossignol Sin 7 skis feature 98mm waists that require bindings with wide brakes. Base or topsheet color may vary from photo.","short_description":"The lightweight, highly responsive Rossignol Sin 7 skis use 98mm waists, a rockered profile designed for powder and lightweight construction to take on any conditions Mother Nature can cook up.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382107.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382107.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382107&tt=df","retail_price":"599.95","sale_price":"479.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382107\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382107.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859370&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8593700001":{"sku":"8593700001","vendor_sku":"RACQJ01","size":"172 CM","retail_price":"479.93","sale_price":"479.93"},"8593700002":{"sku":"8593700002","vendor_sku":"RACQJ01","size":"180 CM","retail_price":"479.93","sale_price":"479.93"},"8593700003":{"sku":"8593700003","vendor_sku":"RACQJ01","size":"188 CM","retail_price":"479.93","sale_price":"479.93"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
