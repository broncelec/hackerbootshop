Narrow 97mm fit allows direct liner contact with the inserts for exceptional feel and response. Stiff polycarbonate inserts under big toe, little toe and heel work with the shell to transfer energy to skis. Women-specific liner is designed with a lower cuff than unisex boots to accommodate women's calf muscles; liner is scallop-shaped in back to ensure a comfortable fit. Accommodating forefoot and instep area combine with a strong heel cup, asymmetrical toe box and articulated ankle area for increased comfort, circulation and warmth. 1-piece toe box and tongue eliminates seams and overlaps in the tongue attachment area, reducing pressure points at the instep and top of the toes. Ultra-Grip soles deliver traction and durability. Stiff flex index offers performance for expert skiers.
