{"sku":"865361","manufacturer_id":"70602514R","brand_name":"Sierra Designs","product_name":" Sierra Designs Backcountry Bed 600 2-Season Sleeping Bag - Women's","long_description":"The Sierra Designs Backcountry Bed 600 2-Season Sleeping Bag for women has an integrated comforter and no zippers for a unique outdoor sleeping experience through spring and summer. Climb into the bag via the large oval opening on top; the oversize comforter seals up the opening so you can sleep comfortably no matter your position: back, side or stomach. Comforter wraps naturally around you no matter what position you're in; comforter and bag combo is rated to keep you warm down to about 32degF in spring and summer. On warmer nights, flip the comforter outside the sleeping bag and tuck it back for ventilation; insulated hand/arm pockets provide warmth when the comforter is outside the bag. Down is considered the best insulation available, but when wet it quickly loses loft and the ability to keep you warm; 600-fill-power DriDown is treated to resist moisture. Proprietary process treats each individual duck down plume with a molecular-level polymer so the down stays dry longer, lofts better and dries faster than untreated down. DriDown insulation stays dry 10 times longer, retains 170% more loft when exposed to moisture and dries 33% faster than untreated down. Ripstop polyester exterior endures frequent use in the outdoors; polyester taffeta lining is soft and comfortable next to skin. Sleeping pad sleeve on the bottom of the bag secures your pad (pad not included) to create the experience of a fully integrated bed. Sierra Designs Backcountry Bed 600 2-Season Sleeping Bag for women comes with a stuff sack and storage sack.","short_description":"The Sierra Designs Backcountry Bed 600 2-Season Sleeping Bag for women has an integrated comforter and no zippers for a unique outdoor sleeping experience through spring and summer.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags And Accessories","product_group":"Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s421751.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l421751.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=421751&tt=df","keywords":"compact","retail_price":"289.95","sale_price":"289.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=421751\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m421751.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=865361&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8653610001":{"sku":"8653610001","vendor_sku":"70602514R","upc":"054003745383","size":"Regular","color":"SCUBA","retail_price":"289.95","sale_price":"289.95"}}}
