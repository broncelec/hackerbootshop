{"sku":"867384","manufacturer_id":"7016297","brand_name":"Giro","product_name":" Giro Wind Bike Shirt - Men's","long_description":"A modern spin on waxed cotton results in the men's refined Giro Wind Bike Shirt that blocks wind, resists water and is highly breathable. And, did we mention it looks sharp off the bike, too?. Stretch cotton/spandex EPIC(R) by Nextec encapsulated fabric wraps an ultrathin polymer around each fiber filament for weatherproofing; it's not a coating. EPIC encapsulated fabric is windproof, water resistant, breathable and washable. Clean seams and hidden details create a refined look. Flex pleats on the back open up for comfort when you're in riding position, and lie flat when you're off the bike. Front button placket hides a 2-way zipper for venting any way you want it. The men's Giro Wind Bike Shirt features a front chest pocket and is made in California.","short_description":"A modern spin on waxed cotton results in the men's refined Giro Wind Bike Shirt that blocks wind, resists water and is highly breathable.
