Wider in the rear than typical race saddles, the Butterfly Ti bike saddle offers great support for a woman's sit bones. Completely cut away through the nose and mid section for flex and comfort against soft tissues. Low-profile flat top with multidensity injection molded foam; the rear is a bit stiffer for more pedaling power. Lightweight titanium rails attach to the shell in an integrated suspension bridge design that minimizes road shock. The Terry Butterfly Ti bike saddle features a leather cover that wears beautifully over time; it features a cute textured butterfly graphic.","short_description":"The Terry Butterfly Ti bike saddle is the lightest and most comfortable saddle Terry makes, and it's designed just for women.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Components","product_group":"Bike Saddles And Seatposts","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s388903.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l388903.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=388903&tt=df","retail_price":"154.00","sale_price":"154.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=388903\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m388903.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=814015&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8140150002":{"sku":"8140150002","vendor_sku":"2104900","upc":"666953342149","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"154.00","sale_price":"154.00"}}}
