{"sku":"811421","manufacturer_id":"J101622","brand_name":"Chaco","product_name":"Chaco Z/2 Unaweep Sandals - Women's","long_description":"The Chaco Z/2 Unaweep women's sandals offer great versatility, comfort and support for water or land use thanks to a rugged outsole and an easily adjustable, secure strap system. Adjustable polyester strapping system uses pull-through design to give you a secure fit while avoiding the bulkiness of extra buckles and straps. Polyester webbing dries faster than nylon and maintains a consistent fit in all conditions; adjustable toe loops add extra measure of security. Shaped polyurethane footbeds/midsoles features a gender-specific design along with heel risers, heel cups and extra arch support for lasting pronation control. Vibram(R) Unaweep outsoles combine the features of both the classic Chaco Colorado and Terreno outsoles into a versatile hybrid. Nonmarking 4 - 5mm lugs are spaced for self-cleaning performance; outsoles deliver dependable traction on land or underwater. Vegan-friendly sandal design can be resoled for a lasting relationship and easing of environmental stress. Toss the Chaco Z/2 Unaweep sandals into washing machine for easy cleaning or clean by hand with scrub brush, baking soda and water; avoid bleach and air dry.","short_description":"The Chaco Z/2 Unaweep women's sandals offer great versatility, comfort and support for water or land use thanks to a rugged outsole and an easily adjustable, secure strap system.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Women's Footwear","product_group":"Women's Sandals","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s387071.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l387071.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=387071&tt=df","keywords":"water","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=387071\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m387071.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=811421&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8114210036":{"sku":"8114210036","vendor_sku":"J104278","upc":"018466661154","size":"6","color":"FORWARD","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"},"8114210038":{"sku":"8114210038","vendor_sku":"J104278","upc":"018466661291","size":"8","color":"FORWARD","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"},"8114210039":{"sku":"8114210039","vendor_sku":"J104278","upc":"018466661314","size":"9","color":"FORWARD","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"},"8114210040":{"sku":"8114210040","vendor_sku":"J104278","upc":"018466661338","size":"10","color":"FORWARD","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"},"8114210041":{"sku":"8114210041","vendor_sku":"J104278","upc":"018466661352","size":"11","color":"FORWARD","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"},"8114210045":{"sku":"8114210045","vendor_sku":"J104278W","upc":"018466661451","size":"8 /WIDE","color":"FORWARD","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"},"8114210100":{"sku":"8114210100","vendor_sku":"J100024","upc":"040707362520","size":"8 /Med","color":"BLUE","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"},"8114210134":{"sku":"8114210134","vendor_sku":"J100024","upc":"481142101341","size":"11 /Med","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"}},"categories":["footwear","womens-footwear","womens-sandals"]}
