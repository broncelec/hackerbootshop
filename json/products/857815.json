{"sku":"857815","manufacturer_id":"R120300901130","brand_name":"Ride","product_name":"Ride Anthem Boa Snowboard Boots - 2013/2014","long_description":"Zip through trees, rip up groomers and throw down in the park in Ride Anthem Boa(R) snowboard boots. Supportive and comfortable, they offer a flexible, forgiving ride that's ready to go anywhere. Boa(R) Coiler lacing system, with ankle and cable guides along entire edge of eyestays, distributes closure force evenly for a dialed-in fit that won't loosen up. The Coiler scoops up loose cable when entering as well as exiting the boot; put your foot in, pull back on the tongue, twist the reel a few times and you're off. Intuition(TM) Plush liners with multi-density foam are body-heat activated over several days' use or immediately custom-formable on in-store pipe heaters. External J-bars increase heel hold; Lock Down speed laces tighten liners quickly and easily for a supportive, nonslip fit. Single-piece Grip outsoles are extremely durable and offer solid traction.","short_description":"Zip through trees, rip up groomers and throw down in the park in Ride Anthem Boa(R) snowboard boots.
