{"sku":"836988","manufacturer_id":"COM-SNPP","brand_name":"Goldcoast","product_name":" Goldcoast The Snapper Longboard","long_description":"The Goldcoast Snapper longboard rides as smooth as a slipstream. Its 44 in. long Nomad shape and kick tail and nose provide comfortable foot placement on either end of the board. Cast away with the Snapper hand drawn artwork; designed by Brazilian artist Ciro Bicudo, the graphic is a nod to handcarved fishing lures. Bi-axial bamboo laminate construction provides durability, response and elasticity; bamboo is fast-growing, renewable, lightweight and strong. Clear grip tape lets the skateboard's natural beauty show through. Century 159mm regular-pivot trucks offer nimble and familiar turning, and have a raw tumbled finish. With the 75mm, 78a Big Slick wheels, your turns will stick like fishhooks into the mouth of the road. Century 0.25 in. flat risers prevent wheel bite. Snapper includes genuine Goldcoast ABEC 7 bearings with Teflon(R) and 90a bushings. Please note: wheel colors may vary from photo.","short_description":"The Goldcoast Snapper longboard rides as smooth as a slipstream.
