Ideal for wetsuits, drysuits, booties and gloves, this biodegradable cleaning formula works on neoprene and latex. Over time, salt and chlorine can damage neoprene and latex, reduce flexibility and tarnish the appearance. The McNett Wetsuit and Drysuit Shampoo is designed to remove odors, salt and chlorine while preventing premature aging of garments. Add a couple capfuls of this solution to a gallon of cold or warm water, wash by hand with a kneading motion, rinse with fresh water, and then air dry. Good for approximately 16 standard treatments.","short_description":"Keep your paddling gear looking, feeling, and performing like new with the McNett Wetsuit and Drysuit Shampoo.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Gear Storage And Maintenance","product_group":"Treatments And Washes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s419551.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l419551.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=419551&tt=df","keywords":"treatment,dwr","retail_price":"5.95","sale_price":"5.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=419551\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m419551.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=852497&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8524970001":{"sku":"8524970001","vendor_sku":"30120","upc":"021563301205","size":"8 OZ","retail_price":"5.95","sale_price":"5.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","gear-storage-and-maintenance","treatments-and-washes"]}
