{"sku":"864977","manufacturer_id":"10223-3","brand_name":"Saucony","product_name":" Saucony Triumph 11 Road-Running Shoes - Women's","long_description":"Featuring midsoles made entirely of super-plush PowerGrid material, the women's Saucony Triumph 11 Road-Running Shoes grant every runner's wish for a cushioned yet lightweight training shoe. Updated design provides more support than previous versions, while locking the foot to the platform for excellent feel and performance on long runs. PowerGrid midsoles with innovative PowerFoam effectively center the feet, absorb impact and distribute pressure, resulting in an exceptionally smooth and responsive ride. Super Rebound Compound (SRC) crashpads have been reengineered to incorporate grooves that provide an even smoother transition from heel-strike to toe-off. SRC pads provide durable shock absorption. Collar lining material combines superior moisture wicking properties with a plush feel for comfort. Molded insoles cradle the heels, support the arches and reduce pressure in the forefeet; premium EVA creates an exceptionally responsive feel. IBR+(TM) rubber in the outsoles is 33% lighter and provides 3 times more cushioning compared to standard blown rubber. Outsoles on the Saucony Triumph 11 Road-Running Shoes also feature carbon rubber for exceptional traction and high-wear properties.","short_description":"Featuring midsoles made entirely of super-plush PowerGrid material, the women's Saucony Triumph 11 Road-Running Shoes grant every runner's wish for a cushioned yet lightweight training shoe.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Women's Footwear","product_group":"Women's Shoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s387871.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l387871.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=387871&tt=df","retail_price":"140.00","sale_price":"140.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=387871\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m387871.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=864977&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8649770003":{"sku":"8649770003","vendor_sku":"10223-3","upc":"720026730155","size":"7","color":"BLUE/RED","retail_price":"140.00","sale_price":"140.00"},"8649770004":{"sku":"8649770004","vendor_sku":"10223-3","upc":"720026730162","size":"7.5","color":"BLUE/RED","retail_price":"140.00","sale_price":"140.00"},"8649770008":{"sku":"8649770008","vendor_sku":"10223-3","upc":"720026730209","size":"9.5","color":"BLUE/RED","retail_price":"140.00","sale_price":"140.00"},"8649770009":{"sku":"8649770009","vendor_sku":"10223-3","upc":"720026730216","size":"10","color":"BLUE/RED","retail_price":"140.00","sale_price":"140.00"}},"categories":["footwear","womens-footwear","womens-shoes"]}
