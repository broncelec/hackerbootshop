{"sku":"830421","manufacturer_id":"53369","brand_name":"Camelbak","product_name":" CamelBak Groove Insulated Filter Water Bottle - 20 fl. oz.","long_description":"The CamelBak Groove(TM) Insulated Filter bottle turns potable tap water into great-tasting water and keeps it cool so you can enjoy it at home, in the office or on the go. Simply fill the bottle with tap water, screw the cap on and start sipping; the integrated plant-based carbon filter reduces chlorine taste and odors found in tap water. Filter lasts for about 3 mos. or 48 gal. of water and is an easy way to enjoy tap water rather than purchasing disposable bottles of water. CamelBak Groove Filter bottle should be used to improve the taste of safe water sources only; filter does not remove viruses, bacteria or protozoa from water. Double-wall construction keeps water cool and reduces condensation on the outside of the bottle. Made of Eastman Tritan(TM) copolyester, the bottle is completely BPA-free and is dishwasher safe (do not put filter in the dishwasher). Tritan copolyester provides excellent impact resistance and is suitable for both warm and cold beverages. Just bite the Big Bite(TM) valve and sip and the water starts flowing-you don't even need to tip the bottle to drink. Bite valve has an articulating stem, so when not in use it folds down next to the bottle and stays clean. Carry the integrated handle in the crook of a finger, or connect it to a pack or waistbelt with a small carabiner, sold separately.","short_description":"The CamelBak Groove(TM) Insulated Filter bottle turns potable tap water into great-tasting water and keeps it cool so you can enjoy it at home, in the office or on the go.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Water Bottles And Treatment","product_group":"Water Bottles, Flasks And Jugs","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s425655.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l425655.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=425655&tt=df","retail_price":"25.00","sale_price":"25.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=425655\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m425655.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=830421&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8304210001":{"sku":"8304210001","vendor_sku":"53369","upc":"886798533704","color":"GRAPHITE","retail_price":"25.00","sale_price":"25.00"},"8304210002":{"sku":"8304210002","vendor_sku":"53369","upc":"886798533698","color":"AQUA","retail_price":"25.00","sale_price":"25.00"}}}
