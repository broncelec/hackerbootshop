{"sku":"724381","manufacturer_id":"2406","brand_name":"Superfeet","product_name":" Superfeet Blue Premium Insoles - Low to Medium Volume","long_description":"These blue Superfeet(R) insoles align and control the motion of your feet, providing balance, support and shock absorption for hiking and other active sports. Low- to medium-volume insoles take up less volume, making them ideal for close-fitting shoes or wide feet. Full-length closed-cell foam provides cushioning, while 3/4-length polypropylene heel caps stabilize feet inside boots. Deep heel pockets, rockered bottoms and soft edges allow for natural cushioning and shock absorption. Superfeet recommends this style for use in footwear with non-removable insoles. Blue Superfeet are not recommended for use with Gore-Tex(R) footwear as shape of rigid heel cap can stress GTX linings (try Green Premium insoles if arch allows).","short_description":"These blue Superfeet(R) insoles align and control the motion of your feet, providing balance, support and shock absorption for hiking and other active sports.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Footwear Accessories","product_group":"Insoles","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s376619.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l376619.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=376619&tt=df","keywords":"shoe inserts","retail_price":"39.95","sale_price":"39.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=376619\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m376619.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=724381&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7243810079":{"sku":"7243810079","vendor_sku":"2404","upc":"086301524049","size":"B (3.5-5)","color":"Blue","retail_price":"39.95","sale_price":"39.95"},"7243810087":{"sku":"7243810087","vendor_sku":"2406","upc":"086301524063","size":"C (5.5-7)","color":"Blue","retail_price":"39.95","sale_price":"39.95"},"7243810095":{"sku":"7243810095","vendor_sku":"2408","upc":"086301524087","size":"D (7.5-9)","color":"Blue","retail_price":"39.95","sale_price":"39.95"},"7243810103":{"sku":"7243810103","vendor_sku":"2410","upc":"086301524100","size":"E (9.5-11)","color":"Blue","retail_price":"39.95","sale_price":"39.95"},"7243810111":{"sku":"7243810111","vendor_sku":"2412","upc":"086301524124","size":"F (11.5-13)","color":"Blue","retail_price":"39.95","sale_price":"39.95"},"7243810129":{"sku":"7243810129","vendor_sku":"2414","upc":"086301524148","size":"G (13.5-15)","color":"Blue","retail_price":"39.95","sale_price":"39.95"}},"categories":["footwear","footwear-accessories","insoles"]}
