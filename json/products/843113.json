Printed plush material lets you climb steep slopes in search of deep powder; improved material is designed to glide better than previous versions. Tenacious glue effectively sticks to your skis in all temperatures. Adjustable tip attachment fits a wide range of ski tip shapes; tip loop width adjusts from 80mm to 105mm. Tip design eliminates the traditional fold-over section at the front of the skin, thereby reducing weight and bulk. STS tail attachment fits any ski you have on hand. Black Diamond Ascension Nylon STS climbing skins include detailed instructions, skin trimming tool, Cheat Sheet mesh storage sheets and a nylon storage bag. Maximum length of the skin is 200cm; STS tail allows 10cm of length adjustment. Please note: weight spec represents a pair of untrimmed skins.","short_description":"The Black Diamond Ascension Nylon STS climbing skins feature an improved printed plush material with better glide than before and the same great grip when climbing.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Climbing Skins","product_group":"Ski Skins","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s408347.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l408347.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=408347&tt=df","retail_price":"169.95","sale_price":"169.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=408347\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m408347.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=843113&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8431130001":{"sku":"8431130001","vendor_sku":"BD163662000080_","upc":"793661165996","size":"80 MM","color":"ORANGE","retail_price":"149.95","sale_price":"149.95"},"8431130002":{"sku":"8431130002","vendor_sku":"BD163663000095_","upc":"793661166009","size":"95 MM","color":"ORANGE","retail_price":"149.95","sale_price":"149.95"}},"categories":["snow","climbing-skins","ski-skins"]}
