{"sku":"861321","manufacturer_id":"975","brand_name":"C.A.M.P. Usa","product_name":"C.A.M.P. USA Dyneema Tricam Set - Package of 4","long_description":"The C.A.M.P. USA Dyneema Tricam set includes four Tricams that cover a 16 - 41mm range and can be used in active cam or passive chock positions to fit where other gear won't on long trad climbs. Tricams have been updated with stiffer sewing on the slings than on previous versions to make one-handed placement and removal easier. Compared to nylon, Dyneema maintains a higher breaking strength when wet; it's also naturally water resistant to keep the slings from soaking up moisture and icing over. When used in passive mode as a chock, Tricams can fit a wide variety of crack types, from flaring to uneven. Camming mode results in a tripod configuration that works well in parallel cracks, slight flares and horizontal cracks. C.A.M.P. USA Dyneema Tricams are made from hardened anodized aluminum for lasting service and reliability; sizes are color-coded for easy identification in your rack.","short_description":"The C.A.M.P.
