{"sku":"861362","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":"REI Sahara Convertible Pants - Women's Plus Sizes","long_description":"Women's REI Sahara Convertible Pants in plus sizes have a No-Sit Zips design that lets you quickly and cleanly switch from pants to shorts, so you can get on with your hike. No-Sit Zips have side zippers that run the full length of the lower legs, so you can peel them off without having to sit down and slide the legs over muddy footwear. Color-coded thigh zippers help you easily tell the right leg from the left leg when converting back to pants. Lightweight nylon fabric dries fast and has a durable water repellent finish; fabric also allows pants to pack down small. UPF 50+ rating provides excellent protection against harmful UV rays. Multiple pockets provide storage for essentials; many pockets have secure zip closures and all pockets have mesh or eyelets to allow drainage. Center gusset and elastic in back waist ease movement; soft waistband liner and flat seams increase comfort. Reinforced cuff backs stand up to abrasion from boots. Women's REI Sahara Convertible Pants in plus sizes have a relaxed fit that generously allows for comfort and movement.","short_description":"Women's REI Sahara Convertible Pants in plus sizes have a No-Sit Zips design that lets you quickly and cleanly switch from pants to shorts, so you can get on with your hike.","category":"Women's","subcategory":"Women's Pants","product_group":"Women's Convertible Pants","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s355751.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l355751.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=355751&tt=df","keywords":"zip off,trekking,women,pant,lightweight","retail_price":"64.50","sale_price":"64.50","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=355751\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m355751.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=861362&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8613620001":{"sku":"8613620001","vendor_sku":"16131","upc":"486136200017","size":"16W","color":"ASPHALT","retail_price":"64.50","sale_price":"64.50"}}}
