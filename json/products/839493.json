{"sku":"839493","manufacturer_id":"12040502","brand_name":"Scarpa","product_name":"Scarpa Gea Randonee Boots - Women's - 2012/2013","long_description":"Take on strenuous climbs and challenging descents in the backcountry with the Scarpa Gea randonee boots. Lightweight yet performance-oriented, the Gea boots have the fit and features you need. Feature Pebax Rnew(R) plastic that is made from castor plant oil rather than petroleum as most plastics are. Pebax Rnew peforms exceptionally well across a wide range of temperatures, ensuring consistent flex, strength and stability. Shell design combines the best of both the overlap and cabrio constructions to allow easy entry/exit, excellent volume control and strong support for downhill performance. Touring-style Intuition Pro Flex G liners use 100% Ultralon(R) foam for a custom fit; liners offer good range of motion yet provide support with stiff tongues. Tongue-style liners (as opposed to a wrap-style liners) provide easy entry and comfortable flex through the shins when touring. See an REI ski shop professional to have the liners custom molded to your feet to maximize comfort and performance. Boots are compatible with all randonee bindings; tech fittings at the toes accept Dynafit-style bindings. Tech fittings have grooves that make getting into Dynafit-style bindings easy; fitting indicators can be seen from above to help you line the boot toes up with the bindings. 3 magnesium buckles and an instep strap on each boot lock your feet in place; instep straps are easy to engage with gloves on. Buckle clasps keep the buckles in place for rapid transitions between uphill and downhill. Wide rip-and-stick power straps wrap securely around the outside of the cuffs, distributing pressure and bringing the cuffs as close as possible your lower legs. Rear ski/walk mechanisms free the cuffs for walking comfort; flip the switches to ski mode and you can lock the cuffs at 16deg or 20deg of forward lean.","short_description":"Take on strenuous climbs and challenging descents in the backcountry with the Scarpa Gea randonee boots.
