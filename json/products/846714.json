{"sku":"846714","manufacturer_id":"APUMPT7","brand_name":"Big Agnes","product_name":" Big Agnes Pumphouse Pad Pump Dry Sack","long_description":"The Big Agnes Pumphouse Pad Pump dry sack fills multiple roles when you're backpacking. Use it as a pad pump, dry sack, pillow, water carrier and backcountry shower. To inflate your Big Agnes sleeping pad (sold separately), open the drawstring on the nozzle end, place it on an open sleeping pad valve and then cinch the drawstring. Allow air to enter the other end of the stuff sack, then roll the stuff sack end partially closed and inflate the pad with the air inside the Pumphouse. When you're not inflating your pad, the Pumphouse can be used as a dry sack to protect clothes and gear from rain. Water-tight construction allows the Pumphouse to be used to transport water from the stream to your campsite, and can even be used as a backcountry shower. Big Agnes Pumphouse Pad Pump dry sack is made from lightweight Cordura(R) nylon that resists abrasion, tears and scuffs.","short_description":"The Big Agnes Pumphouse Pad Pump dry sack fills multiple roles when you're backpacking.
