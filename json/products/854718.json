{"sku":"854718","brand_name":"Patagonia","product_name":"Patagonia Powder Bowl Shell Pants - Women's","long_description":"Boasting Gore-Tex(R) waterproof protection, the Patagonia Powder Bowl women's shell pants offer all-condition, all-season protection no matter the slopes you ride, from inbounds to out-of-bounds. Sturdy Gore-Tex waterproof, breathable shell fabric ensures you stay dry in heavy storms; 2-layer construction incorporates a sweat-wicking mesh lining to keep you comfortable. Durable Water Repellent finish causes water to bead up and roll off, fending off melting snow to help keep you dry. Embedded RECCO(R) reflector enhances radio signals from search-and-rescue RECCO detectors, helping speed up the search for a buried avalanche victim. Mesh-lined interior thigh vents let you release excess body heat while keeping out snow. Loop at rear of waistband lets you securely connect a compatible Patagonia jacket's powder skirt to the pants for an integrated riding system (jacket sold separately). Brushed lining on waistband wicks sweat and provides against-the-skin comfort; zip-fly, two-snap closure and adjustable waistband tabs provide a personalized fit. Snow gaiters securely wrap around boots to keep snow from entering pants; scuff guards protect insides of legs and cuffs from abrasion and sharp edges. Gusseted crotch and articulated knees on the Patagonia Powder Bowl shell pants allow unrestricted movement for deep knee drops and ease when skinning up. Zippered handwarmer pockets; zippered thigh cargo pocket; zippered back pocket.","short_description":"Boasting Gore-Tex(R) waterproof protection, the Patagonia Powder Bowl women's shell pants offer all-condition, all-season protection no matter the slopes you ride, from inbounds to out-of-bounds.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Women's Ski Clothing","product_group":"Women's Ski Pants","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s338227.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l338227.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=338227&tt=df","keywords":"snowpant,pants,snow pants,hardshell pants,pant","retail_price":"299.00","sale_price":"299.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=338227\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m338227.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=854718&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8547180001":{"sku":"8547180001","vendor_sku":"31431","upc":"887187173556","size":"XS","color":"PALE KHAKI","retail_price":"238.93","sale_price":"238.93"},"8547180002":{"sku":"8547180002","vendor_sku":"31431","upc":"887187173587","size":"S","color":"PALE KHAKI","retail_price":"238.93","sale_price":"238.93"},"8547180003":{"sku":"8547180003","vendor_sku":"31431","upc":"887187173617","size":"M","color":"PALE KHAKI","retail_price":"238.93","sale_price":"238.93"},"8547180004":{"sku":"8547180004","vendor_sku":"31431","upc":"887187173648","size":"L","color":"PALE KHAKI","retail_price":"238.93","sale_price":"238.93"}}}
