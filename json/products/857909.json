{"sku":"857909","manufacturer_id":"R130301401075","brand_name":"Ride","product_name":"Ride Cadence Focus Boa Snowboard Boots - Women's - 2013/2014","long_description":"The high-end Ride Cadence Boa Focus women's snowboard boots blend freestyle mobility with lightweight goodness. Boa(R) Focus lacing and Intuition(TM) liners deliver a precise, comfortable fit. Easy-moving Intuition Mobile liners with dual-density foam are body-heat activated over several days or immediately custom-formable on in-store pipe heaters. Liners securely wrap feet and include internal and external, heel-locking J-bars with cored ankle pockets; 3D-formed, dual-density EVA footbeds provide anatomic support. Impacto multi-density insoles add structural support in the heels for cush landings and all-day comfort. Lock Down speed laces tighten liners quickly and easily for a supportive, nonslip fit; Tallboy Harness wraps insteps and ankles for a supportive flex and responsive fit. Rip-and-stick boot cuff adjustments allow a personalized fit around the calves for enhanced comfort. Boa Focus lacing system personalizes the fit by allowing the upper and lower zones to tighten independently of each other. Boa Focus concentrates closure on the instep and allows superior heel hold no matter how loose or snug the upper zone is cranked. Centered over the forefeet, Closer Lace Guides drive power down low and even out the lace tension throughout the entire boot; molded 3D tongues add support and comfort. Ride Cadence boots are built with Blown Light Apex outsoles, featuring heel impact gel pods for superior comfort.","short_description":"The high-end Ride Cadence Boa Focus women's snowboard boots blend freestyle mobility with lightweight goodness.
