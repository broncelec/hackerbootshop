Fixed, adjustable padded shoulder strap ensures comfortable, non-slip carrying; AirScape mesh back panel padding reduces heat build-up. Handle-It(TM) attachment flap quickly connects Ozone Courier bag to extendable roller handles up to 6 in. wide; its design provides well-balanced carrying. Large front organizer pocket with key clip. Padded sleeve fits and protects laptops to 15 in. and has direct zipper access. Padded sleeve fits most tablet and e-reader devices. Stretch mesh side pockets. Folder/magazine sleeve. Zip pocket holds eyeglasses and other small items. Side compression straps ensure secure carrying no matter what size your load is. While the Ozone Courier is a beautiful complement to the Osprey Ozone wheeled luggage, this sharp, cosmopolitan bag can certainly be carried on its own. Please note: although not removable, the Handle-It attachment flap lays down flush against the back panel when not in use, so you won't even know its there.","short_description":"The Osprey Ozone Courier bag brings protection and organization for all the necessities of travel.
