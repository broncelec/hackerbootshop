Cam-action spring hinges quickly lock temples into position. Native Eyewear Bigfork interchangeable polarized sunglasses include a protective case and a soft pouch that doubles as a cleaning cloth. Frames best fit large to extra large profiles.","short_description":"The Native Eyewear Bigfork Polarized sunglasses offer a large fit for adventurers of a larger stature.
