{"sku":"862880","manufacturer_id":"SW048-001","brand_name":"Smartwool","product_name":"SmartWool PhD Mountaineering Socks","long_description":"Featuring warm merino wool and plush cushioning, the SmartWool PhD Mountaineering Socks deliver great insulation while you're bagging your first fourteener or trekking over cold, snowy trails. Heavy cushioning on heel and toe offers maximum comfort and protection in high-impact areas; flat-knit foot and leg fit comfortably inside low-volume mountaineering boots. 4 Degree Elite Fit System improves comfort with two elastics around ankle and instep to provide greater stretch and recovery to keep the socks in place. Patented ReliaWool is a reinforcement construction that puts more wool in high-wear, high-impact areas to increase durability and comfort. Merino wool provides excellent temperature control and moisture management, so you're warm when it's cold and cool when it's warm. Strategically placed mesh zones provide ventilation for temperature and moisture management. Merino wool keeps your feet dry and inhospitable to bacteria that can cause odor. SmartWool socks are guaranteed not to itch and can be repeatedly machine-washed and dried without shrinking. Flat-knit toe seams reduce chafing and irritation for long-lasting comfort. SmartWool PhD Mountaineering Socks are 14 in. tall. *Discount will be applied when you check out.
