Lofted microfiber insulation is laminated to the top and bottom of the inner walls, providing efficient 4-season warmth. Baffled chambers evenly distribute insulation to eliminate cold spots. R-value equals 6; most sleeping pads REI sells range in R-value from 1.0 (minimally insulated) to 9.5 (well insulated). Exped accessory pump (sold separately) recommended for inflation, though pad can also be inflated by mouth; 2 wide, low-profile, FlatValves allow inflation and deflation. Intake valve features a built-in flap to prevent air escaping when inflating; flap can be released to let a little air out when seeking out that ideal comfort zone. Polyester fabric is UV- and abrasion-resistant; nonslip finish helps keep you on the pad. Welded seams create airtight construction. The Exped SynMat UL 9 Sleeping Pad comes with its own stuff sack for protection during transport.
