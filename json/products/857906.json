{"sku":"857906","manufacturer_id":"R130200401161","brand_name":"Ride","product_name":"Ride Machete GT Snowboard - 2013/2014","long_description":"Bust through crud, float through deep pow, and carve hard turns all over the mountain on the Ride Machete GT snowboard. This board will change the way you ride; it's that amazing. Hybrid LowRize(TM) rocker features a micro camber section between your feet and rocker at the nose and tail, making the board equally at home in the park and on the steeps. Twin shape places you in a centered stance for a balanced ride whether riding regular or switch. Lightweight Aspen core incorporates bamboo to provide a perfect balance between strength and weight; fiberglass wraps the core to provide a complete web of protection. Carbon Array 5(TM) stringers in the binding zone channel power to the board for maximum control. Popwalls(R) sidewalls absorb impact and smooth the interaction between the board and riding surface; plus, as a bonus, they glow in the dark. Edges contain nearly 50% more steel than standard snowboard edges, resulting in unmatched resistance to edge cracking; edges can be \"detuned\" to enlarge board's turning radii. Ride Machete GT snowboard features a Fusion 4000 sintered base that is durable, hard and, best of all, fast. .","short_description":"Bust through crud, float through deep pow, and carve hard turns all over the mountain on the Ride Machete GT snowboard.
