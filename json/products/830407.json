{"sku":"830407","manufacturer_id":"53521","brand_name":"Camelbak","product_name":"CamelBak Kids' eddy Water Bottle - 14 fl. oz.","long_description":"Recommended for ages 3 - 8, the CamelBak Kids' eddy(TM) water bottle features a spill-resistant design and fun graphics to keep you and your kids happy. Simple 1-piece bite valve is designed to be easy for young children to use; bite valve effectively limits drips and spills. Made of Eastman Tritan(TM) copolyester, the bottle is completely BPA-free and is dishwasher safe. Tritan copolyester provides excellent impact resistance and is suitable for both warm and cold beverages. Just bite and sip and the beverage flows through the valve; or, remove the straw inside and lift and tip to drink. Bite valve has an articulating stem, so when not in use it folds down next to the bottle and stays clean. Carry the integrated handle in the crook of a finger, or connect it to a pack or waistbelt with a small carabiner (not included). Simply unscrew the cap to uncover bottle's wide-mouth opening for easy filling and cleaning; standard cap size fits many other wide-mouth bottles. Bottle is shaped to fit nicely in kids' hands and accommodates most automobile cup holders. All components are dishwasher safe (top rack only); do not microwave. CamelBak does not recommend the use of carbonated beverages with the straw configuration; remove straw and drink by tipping and sipping.","short_description":"Recommended for ages 3 - 8, the CamelBak Kids' eddy(TM) water bottle features a spill-resistant design and fun graphics to keep you and your kids happy.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Water Bottles And Treatment","product_group":"Water Bottles, Flasks And Jugs","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s425627.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l425627.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=425627&tt=df","retail_price":"13.00","sale_price":"13.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=425627\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m425627.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=830407&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8304070008":{"sku":"8304070008","vendor_sku":"53448","upc":"886798534480","color":"HEART/PURPLE","retail_price":"13.00","sale_price":"13.00"},"8304070009":{"sku":"8304070009","vendor_sku":"53449","upc":"886798534497","color":"DINOSAUR/BLUE","retail_price":"13.00","sale_price":"13.00"},"8304070011":{"sku":"8304070011","vendor_sku":"53521","upc":"886798535210","color":"FRUIT","retail_price":"13.00","sale_price":"13.00"},"8304070012":{"sku":"8304070012","vendor_sku":"53523","upc":"886798535234","color":"SEA","retail_price":"13.00","sale_price":"13.00"},"8304070013":{"sku":"8304070013","vendor_sku":"53520","upc":"886798535203","color":"DOLLS","retail_price":"13.00","sale_price":"13.00"},"8304070014":{"sku":"8304070014","vendor_sku":"53522","upc":"886798535227","color":"SPORTS","retail_price":"13.00","sale_price":"13.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","water-bottles-and-treatment","water-bottles-flasks-and-jugs"]}
