{"sku":"849665","manufacturer_id":"2000009650","brand_name":"Coleman","product_name":" Coleman Portable Propane Stove/Oven","long_description":"Expand your campground cooking options with the Coleman Portable propane stove/oven. Now you can bake a cake or make homemade bread while sauteing dinner on the stove top. Two 6,000 BTU stove burners and one 3,000 BTU oven burner can be operated at the same time so you can make dinner on the stove top while baking dessert in the oven. View-through oven door lets you keep an eye on your cookies until they are golden brown. 2 folding side shields can be oriented vertically to block burner and grill from winds, improving efficiency and reducing cooking time. The shields can be oriented horizontally for convenient side shelves to hold condiments and cooking utensils; top lid also serves as a wind block. Battery-assisted electric ignition sparks the burners to life quickly and easily without having to hassle with matches. Coleman Portable propane stove/oven operates on standard 16.4 oz. propane canisters, not included; can operate on a bulk cylinder with appropriate adapter, sold separately. Due to flammable item shipping restrictions, we cannot sell fuel canisters online; they are available at REI retail stores.","short_description":"Expand your campground cooking options with the Coleman Portable propane stove/oven.
