{"sku":"837864","manufacturer_id":"14080","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":"REI Double Diamond 50 Snow Pack","long_description":"Made for the untracked backcountry, the REI Double Diamond 50 snow pack has a place for everything you need to be safe, have fun and enjoy the powder. Lightweight spring steel frame supports a gear-heavy outing, and it responds well to the movement of skiing and riding. Top lid pocket can hold snow-study tools and small items; outside of pocket features a bungee system for lashing on climbing skins or extra clothing. A-frame ski-carrying system accommodates wide skis and bulky bindings and carries a snowboard vertically; straps tuck away. Zippered back panel entry lets you access your gear and hydration reservoir (not included), even with your skis or board attached. Back panel material sheds snow and dries quickly. Hydration pocket is designed to accept most hydration reservoirs, reservoir not included. Insulated sleeve on shoulder strap stores the hydration hose to help prevent freeze-up and is large enough to accommodate right-angle shut-off valves. Flip back the top lid to access main compartment with room for safety essentials, food and extra layers. Inside the main compartment you'll find a clear accessory pocket and a tool sleeve for a probe or snow saw. Front pleated outside pocket is sized for a shovel and other avalanche gear, and it can be used as a stash pocket for climbing skins. Pocket offers enough room for a shovel blade, a shovel handle and a probe. Tarpaulin liner in pocket resists moisture and abrasion. Snow-resistant buckle closure is used on the front flap opening. Mesh sling zips out to carry your helmet on the trip up and tucks away when not in use; redesigned sling makes it easy to stash small items in nearby pocket. Hipbelt snugs comfortably to help distribute weight to your hips, not your back; hipbelt features a right-side pocket for easy access to small items. Hipbelt webbing system adjusts with a forward pull, creating a secure, ergonomic fit.","short_description":"Made for the untracked backcountry, the REI Double Diamond 50 snow pack has a place for everything you need to be safe, have fun and enjoy the powder.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Packs And Bags","product_group":"Ski Packs","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s259923.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l259923.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=259923&tt=df","keywords":"backpack,small,pack","retail_price":"149.00","sale_price":"149.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=259923\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m259923.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=837864&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8378640001":{"sku":"8378640001","vendor_sku":"14080","upc":"483786400019","color":"PORPOISE","retail_price":"149.00","sale_price":"149.00"}}}
