Multiple layers of fiberglass are layered around a poplar wood core to provide high responsiveness. Early rise in the tips and tails combines with camber underfoot to provide excellent control in powder and responsive carving on hardpack. P-tex sidewalls and layers of rubber foil enhance edge grip and reduce vibrations. Icelantic gives the Nomad RKR SKNY skis a 7 out of 10 stiffness rating. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.","short_description":"Featuring the same feel as the original Icelantic Nomad skis but shrunk down to an 85mm waist for control in icy and hardpack snow, the Icelantic Nomad RKR SKNY skis are adaptable to any terrain.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382215.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382215.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382215&tt=df","retail_price":"699.00","sale_price":"558.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382215\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382215.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859663&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8596630002":{"sku":"8596630002","vendor_sku":"4381","upc":"485966300027","size":"181 CM","retail_price":"558.93","sale_price":"558.93"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
