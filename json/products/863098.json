{"sku":"863098","manufacturer_id":"02758","brand_name":"Msr","product_name":"MSR Papa Hubba NX Tent","long_description":"Streamline your group's backpacking experience with the ultralight and freestanding MSR Papa Hubba NX tent. Spacious, three-season shelter and comfort are yours for up to four backpackers. Unique pole configuration maximizes headroom and elbow space throughout the tent. Set up and take down easily with a unified, color-coded hub-and-pole system; compression sack packs down smaller than most two-person tents. Two large StayDry(TM) doors help ensure water doesn't drip into the tent when doors are opened; two large vestibules store gear. Rainfly vents and venting vestibules help create a dry, comfortable interior. Enjoy a minimum weight (tent, rainfly and poles only) of just 5 lbs. 15 oz. (2.67kg)-less than 1 lb. 9 oz. (0.7kg) per person when shared among four backpackers. Fast & Light(R) setup option lets you use just the rainfly, poles and footprint (sold separately) to reduce the weight to 4 lbs. 11 oz. (2.11kg). 15-denier nylon micromesh and 20-denier, high-tenacity ripstop nylon canopy; 30-denier, high-tenacity ripstop nylon Durashield(TM) polyurethane-coated floor. The MSR Papa Hubba NX tent comes with a 20-denier, high-tenacity ripstop nylon Durashield(TM) polyurethane- and silicone-coated rainfly.","short_description":"Streamline your group's backpacking experience with the ultralight and freestanding MSR Papa Hubba NX tent.
