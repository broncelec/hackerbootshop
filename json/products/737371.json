{"sku":"737371","manufacturer_id":"UTCU102","brand_name":"Metolius","product_name":"Metolius Ultralight Range Finder TCU Cams","long_description":"On free, alpine or aid routes, these ultralight TCU cams feature Direct Axle Technology(TM) for awesome performance and weight savings. Direct Axle Technology allows greater placement options in shallow, narrow or bottoming rock features. Also makes tricky placements easier due to better cam lobe visibility, especially in the smaller sizes. New Range Finder markings eliminate guess work: Green Zone for go, Yellow Zone for caution or trade up sizes and Red Zone for stop! U-shaped body provides greater durability and better control during placement and retraction. Durable, flexible, stainless-steel cable body with long-wearing trigger slides are lightweight, strong and allow easy placement. Split-wire triggers with knurled trigger bars allow you to use one, two or three fingers--or even gloved hands. Features three, wide CNC machined 0.25 in. cams of super-durable 7075-T6 aluminum. Machined cam stops and radiused teeth increase cam durability and holding power; optimized cam angle applies more outward force. Lightweight Dyneema nylon slings are color-coded for quick, easy identification and less bulky than standard nylon slings.","short_description":"On free, alpine or aid routes, these ultralight TCU cams feature Direct Axle Technology(TM) for awesome performance and weight savings.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Protection","product_group":"Cams","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s407107.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l407107.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=407107&tt=df","retail_price":"59.95","sale_price":"59.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=407107\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m407107.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=737371&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7373710016":{"sku":"7373710016","vendor_sku":"UTCT100","upc":"602150464192","size":"Grey","color":"Size 00","retail_price":"59.95","sale_price":"59.95"},"7373710024":{"sku":"7373710024","vendor_sku":"UTCU100","upc":"602150760355","size":"Purple","color":"Size 0","retail_price":"59.95","sale_price":"59.95"},"7373710032":{"sku":"7373710032","vendor_sku":"UTCU101","upc":"602150464215","size":"Blue","color":"Size 1","retail_price":"59.95","sale_price":"59.95"},"7373710040":{"sku":"7373710040","vendor_sku":"UTCU102","upc":"602150760379","size":"Yellow","color":"Size 2","retail_price":"59.95","sale_price":"59.95"},"7373710057":{"sku":"7373710057","vendor_sku":"UTCU103","upc":"602150760386","size":"Orange","color":"Size 3","retail_price":"59.95","sale_price":"59.95"},"7373710065":{"sku":"7373710065","vendor_sku":"UTCU104","upc":"602150464246","size":"Red","color":"Size 4","retail_price":"59.95","sale_price":"59.95"}},"categories":["climbing","climbing-protection","cams"]}
