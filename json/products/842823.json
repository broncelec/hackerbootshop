{"sku":"842823","manufacturer_id":"7326-4072","brand_name":"Brooks","product_name":"Brooks Essential Low Cut Tab Lite Socks - 2 Pairs","long_description":"The Brooks Essential Low Cut Tab Lite socks includes 2 pairs of socks with an Achilles tab, breathable mesh panels and moisture-transfer polyester to keep feet dry and comfortable. Cushioning is primarily in the toes and heels with less in the mid foot; mid foot compression ensures a snug fit and reduces muscle fatigue. Dri-Stitch(TM) polyester effectively wicks moisture while also keeping feet comfortable with a smooth soft feel. Nylon reinforcement in the heel and toe to ensure maximum durability in this very high activity area. Mesh top reduces bulk and allows better air circulation, keeping feet cool and comfortable. Low-profile Achilles tab helps reduce the chances of blisters forming in this friction prone area. Flat toe seam all but eliminates the chance of blisters caused by friction between harsh seams and toes. Size is knit into the Brooks Essential Low Cut Tab Lite socks for quick identification. *Discount will be applied when you check out. Offer not valid for sale-price items ending in $._3 or $._9. Please note: a package of 2 pairs counts as 1 pair of socks for the 10% volume discount.","short_description":"The Brooks Essential Low Cut Tab Lite socks includes 2 pairs of socks with an Achilles tab, breathable mesh panels and moisture-transfer polyester to keep feet dry and comfortable.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Socks","product_group":"Running And Athletic Socks","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s374367.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l374367.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=374367&tt=df","retail_price":"17.00","sale_price":"17.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=374367\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m374367.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=842823&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8428230005":{"sku":"8428230005","vendor_sku":"7326-4072","upc":"026218129463","size":"S","color":"GRAY BLACK/BLACK YELLOW","retail_price":"17.00","sale_price":"17.00"},"8428230006":{"sku":"8428230006","vendor_sku":"7326-4072","upc":"026218129470","size":"M","color":"GRAY BLACK/BLACK YELLOW","retail_price":"17.00","sale_price":"17.00"},"8428230007":{"sku":"8428230007","vendor_sku":"7326-4072","upc":"026218129487","size":"L","color":"GRAY BLACK/BLACK YELLOW","retail_price":"17.00","sale_price":"17.00"},"8428230008":{"sku":"8428230008","vendor_sku":"7326-4072","upc":"026218129494","size":"XL","color":"GRAY BLACK/BLACK YELLOW","retail_price":"17.00","sale_price":"17.00"},"8428230009":{"sku":"8428230009","vendor_sku":"7326-4284","upc":"026218142332","size":"S","color":"BLACK GRAPHITE/BLACK GREY","retail_price":"17.00","sale_price":"17.00"},"8428230010":{"sku":"8428230010","vendor_sku":"7326-4284","upc":"026218142349","size":"M","color":"BLACK GRAPHITE/BLACK GREY","retail_price":"17.00","sale_price":"17.00"},"8428230011":{"sku":"8428230011","vendor_sku":"7326-4284","upc":"026218142356","size":"L","color":"BLACK GRAPHITE/BLACK GREY","retail_price":"17.00","sale_price":"17.00"},"8428230012":{"sku":"8428230012","vendor_sku":"7326-4284","upc":"026218142363","size":"XL","color":"BLACK GRAPHITE/BLACK GREY","retail_price":"17.00","sale_price":"17.00"}},"categories":["footwear","socks","running-and-athletic-socks"]}
