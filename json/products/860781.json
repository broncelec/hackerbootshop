{"sku":"860781","manufacturer_id":"AASS00392174","brand_name":"Atomic","product_name":" Atomic Blackeye Ti ARC Skis with Bindings - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Beefed up with a stiff metal laminate in the lightweight wood core, the advanced-level Atomic Blackeye Ti ARC skis with bindings offer stable 81mm waists to roam the mountain at high speed. Titanium laminate enhances stability and boosts performance at high speeds, and tip-to-tail wood core reduces swing weight and enhances overall handling. 81mm waists carve responsively on hardpack, and they offer enough stability and flotation to have a good time off piste. When skis are weighted, there is a slight rise in the tips that makes it easy to initiate turns. When skis are put on edge after starting a turn, the camber flattens out to deliver full contact with snow and excellent edge hold. Half-cap construction in tips and tails improves durability, and sidewalls in binding area enhance edge grip by absorbing shock. Sidewall construction ensures maximum torsional rigidity, uncanny edge grip and controlled tip-to-tail flex; sidewall is reinforced in binding area with 2 layers of material. Integrated bindings allow the skis to flex naturally for excellent edge contact and bump absorption. Atomic Blackeye Ti ARC skis with bindings features DIN settings that adjust from 4 to 12, a range suited to advanced skiers at medium to high speeds. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.","short_description":"Beefed up with a stiff metal laminate in the lightweight wood core, the advanced-level Atomic Blackeye Ti ARC skis with bindings offer stable 81mm waists to roam the mountain at high speed.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382299.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382299.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382299&tt=df","retail_price":"799.00","sale_price":"639.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382299\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382299.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=860781&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8607810001":{"sku":"8607810001","vendor_sku":"AASS00392167","upc":"884397757415","size":"167 CM","retail_price":"639.93","sale_price":"639.93"},"8607810002":{"sku":"8607810002","vendor_sku":"AASS00392174","upc":"884397757408","size":"174 CM","retail_price":"639.93","sale_price":"639.93"},"8607810003":{"sku":"8607810003","vendor_sku":"AASS00392181","upc":"884397757392","size":"181 CM","retail_price":"639.93","sale_price":"639.93"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
