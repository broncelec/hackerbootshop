{"sku":"860533","manufacturer_id":"7524N1.GB","brand_name":"Marker","product_name":" Marker Griffon 110 Downhill Ski Bindings","long_description":"Designed for advanced skiers starting at 80 lbs., Marker Griffon 110 downhill ski bindings with 110mm brakes help steer powder skis into the best stashes time and time again. DIN settings adjust from 4 - 13, a range suited to advanced skiers and high speeds. Composite toe and heel cups keep binding weight to a minimum, and a wide footprint offers excellent performance on fat skis. Triple Pivot Elite toes have high energy absorption to prevent prerelease. Lightweight Inter-Pivot heels focus power in the direction of the boot soles and offer superior holding power and energy transfer. Freeride brakes ensure adequate clearance when skiing backward. Stainless-steel antifriction devices allow essential lateral boot movement despite dirty or worn soles or negative sliding friction. 110mm brakes fit many powder skis; mounting configuration of the Marker Griffon 110 downhill ski bindings requires a 76mm minimum ski width.","short_description":"Designed for advanced skiers starting at 80 lbs., Marker Griffon 110 downhill ski bindings with 110mm brakes help steer powder skis into the best stashes time and time again.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Bindings","product_group":"Downhill Ski Bindings","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s381623.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l381623.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=381623&tt=df","retail_price":"229.00","sale_price":"229.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=381623\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m381623.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=860533&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8605330001":{"sku":"8605330001","vendor_sku":"7524N1.GB","upc":"883295104093","size":"110 MM","color":"BLACK/WHITE/TEAL","retail_price":"229.00","sale_price":"229.00"}},"categories":["snow","ski-bindings","downhill-ski-bindings"]}
