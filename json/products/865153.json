{"sku":"865153","manufacturer_id":"06422","brand_name":"Therm-A-Rest","product_name":"Therm-a-Rest Trail Pro Sleeping Pad","long_description":"If comfort and ease-of-use are top priorities in your backpacking mattress, the Therm-a-Rest Trail Pro(TM) Sleeping Pad should be at the top of your list. The Trail Pro is the warmest and most comfortable Therm-a-Rest self-inflating pad that's still light enough to take backpacking; features 2 in. of supportive loft. R-value equals 4.0; most sleeping pads we sell range in R-value from 1.0 (minimally insulated) to 9.5 (well insulated). Advanced vacuum-poured foam makes the pad lighter and more compact compared to previous versions. Straighter edges in the torso area (compared to previous versons) increase sleep surface and offer better gap-free mating with other rectangular pads. Therm-a-Rest Trail Pro Sleeping Pad includes a stuff sack.","short_description":"If comfort and ease-of-use are top priorities in your backpacking mattress, the Therm-a-Rest Trail Pro(TM) Sleeping Pad should be at the top of your list.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Pads, Cots And Hammocks","product_group":"Sleeping Pads","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s422243.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l422243.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=422243&tt=df","keywords":"mattress,mats","retail_price":"119.95","sale_price":"119.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=422243\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m422243.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=865153&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8651530001":{"sku":"8651530001","vendor_sku":"06421","upc":"040818064214","size":"Regular","color":"OLIVE","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sleeping-pads-cots-and-hammocks","sleeping-pads"]}
