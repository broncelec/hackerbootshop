{"sku":"830278","manufacturer_id":"RH001","brand_name":"Eno","product_name":" ENO Reactor Hammock","long_description":"If you've ever put a sleeping pad in your hammock, you know how the thing never wants to stay in one place. The ENO Reactor hammock solves the problem with a sleeve to keep your pad secure. A second layer of breathable nylon creates a sleeve that you can slide your sleeping pad (sold separately) into to prevent it from shifting around in the middle of the night. Hammock includes ultralight aluminum carabiners to help you attach it to trees and posts. Maximum capacity of 400 lbs. The ENO Reactor hammock has a built-in stuff sack. Use ENO SlapStrap PRO webbing straps (sold separately) to quickly set the hammock up between large trees and posts. Please note: ENO uses all fabric remnants in the production of their hammocks so the color combination of the hammock you receive may vary slightly from the picture.","short_description":"If you've ever put a sleeping pad in your hammock, you know how the thing never wants to stay in one place.
