{"sku":"847775","manufacturer_id":"3002P","brand_name":"Shebeest","product_name":"Shebeest Triple S Bike Shorts - Women's Plus Sizes","long_description":"Tried and true, the Shebeest Triple S plus-size 8-panel bike shorts are designed to give support for racing and intense training rides. DriStyle(TM) fabric wicks fast, keeping you dry and comfortable when working hard. Fabric also offers built-in temperature regulation, preventing you from heating up or cooling down too fast. DriStyle fabric's hidden benefit is that this temperature regulation helps reduce the likelihood of fatigue or sore muscles after workouts. Seamless, contoured chamois uses variable-density padding in key areas for support, and all-way stretch for added comfort. New laser technology used to cut out the chamois eliminates bulkiness and chafing, reducing pressure to contact areas. 8-panel, articulated construction moves with you while signature elastic leg grippers keep shorts in place; flatlock seams are non-bulky and supple.","short_description":"Tried and true, the Shebeest Triple S plus-size 8-panel bike shorts are designed to give support for racing and intense training rides.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Cycling Clothing","product_group":"Bike Shorts","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s390715.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l390715.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=390715&tt=df","retail_price":"85.00","sale_price":"85.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=390715\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m390715.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=847775&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{},"extended_xml_attributes":"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t","categories":["cycling","cycling-clothing","bike-shorts"]}
