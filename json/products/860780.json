{"sku":"860780","manufacturer_id":"AASS00394178","brand_name":"Atomic","product_name":" Atomic Smoke Ti ARC Skis with Bindings - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Fast and smooth at speed, the advanced-level Atomic Smoke Ti ARC skis with bindings blaze down groomed runs with unwavering stability thanks to 76mm waists and a metal laminate in the core. Titanium laminate enhances stability and boosts performance at high speeds. 76mm waists offer superior maneuverability on groomed runs. When skis are unweighted, there is a slight rise in the tips that makes it easy to initiate turns. When skis are put on edge after starting a turn, the camber flattens out to deliver full-length contact with snow and excellent edge hold. Microcellular composite core is lighter and more lively than wood, and it reduces swing weight for effortless handling. Half-cap construction in tips and tails improves durability, and sidewalls in binding area enhance edge grip by absorbing shock. Sidewall construction ensures maximum torsional rigidity, uncanny edge grip and controlled tip-to-tail flex; sidewall is reinforced in binding area with 2 layers of material. Integrated bindings allow the skis to flex naturally for excellent edge contact and bump absorption. Bindings feature DIN 4 - 12 release settings, a range suited to advanced skiers at medium to high speeds. Base or topsheet color on the Atomic Smoke Ti ARC skis with bindings may vary from online photo.","short_description":"Fast and smooth at speed, the advanced-level Atomic Smoke Ti ARC skis with bindings blaze down groomed runs with unwavering stability thanks to 76mm waists and a metal laminate in the core.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382295.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382295.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382295&tt=df","retail_price":"599.00","sale_price":"479.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382295\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382295.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=860780&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8607800001":{"sku":"8607800001","vendor_sku":"AASS00394164","upc":"884397757576","size":"164 CM","retail_price":"479.93","sale_price":"479.93"},"8607800002":{"sku":"8607800002","vendor_sku":"AASS00394171","upc":"884397757569","size":"171 CM","retail_price":"479.93","sale_price":"479.93"},"8607800003":{"sku":"8607800003","vendor_sku":"AASS00394178","upc":"884397757552","size":"178 CM","retail_price":"479.93","sale_price":"479.93"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
