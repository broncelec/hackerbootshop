{"sku":"822422","manufacturer_id":"N10942180","brand_name":"Madshus","product_name":" Madshus Glittertind MGV+ Cross-Country Skis","long_description":"Glide in the groomed tracks or make your own trail through the woods and travel quickly with the Madshus Glittertind MGV+ cross-country skis. Durable cores feature laminated stringers of wood and a camber tuned for off-trail skiing. Triaxial braiding weaves fiberglass around the cores to produce excellent torsional rigidity and increase strength. Tips and tails remain soft for easy turning without wash out; soft flex enhances flotation in new snow. Multigrip Vario+ (MGV+) wax-free base features a positive waxless pattern with variable depth, spacing and angles. MGV+ pattern is most aggressive under foot and then tapers toward the front and back for smooth, natural glide. Ski confidently down firm slopes thanks to the full-length steel edges on the Madshus Glittertind MGV+ cross-country skis. 68mm tips, 55mm waists and 62mm tails create ample sidecut for turning in soft snow; tip shape breaks trail easily on off-trail adventures. Skis pair well with NNN BC bindings or 3-pin bindings (sold separately).","short_description":"Glide in the groomed tracks or make your own trail through the woods and travel quickly with the Madshus Glittertind MGV+ cross-country skis.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Cross-Country Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s440343.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l440343.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=440343&tt=df","retail_price":"219.95","sale_price":"164.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=440343\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m440343.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=822422&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8224220001":{"sku":"8224220001","vendor_sku":"N10942180","upc":"714636728152","size":"180 CM","color":"BLUE","retail_price":"164.93","sale_price":"164.93"}},"categories":["snow","skis","crosscountry-skis"]}
