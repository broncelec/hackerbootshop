With a stiff flex index of 110, Tecnica Cochise 110 ski boots provide the responsive power transfer preferred by aggressive expert skiers. Ski/hike switch frees upper cuff to work with your stride and makes it easy to hike for your turns. Steel and aluminum, metal-pin-to-metal-plate connection locks the upper cuff to the lower shell when you're ready to ski and allows you to really flex into your skis. Lightweight, mono-injected polymer shell is designed to make it easy going uphill, and it provides the responsive power you need on the way back down. Liners offer superior heel hold, complete foot envelopment and rubberized shock absorption in the tongue, foot and heel. Custom-formable liners can be heated in a specialty ski shop to achieve a personalized fit. Neoprene toe boxes increase warmth in feet and absorb vibrations. Instep catch is hinged, allowing excellent pressure distribution; plus, it lets the shell spread for easy foot entry and exit. Cuff alignment system aligns the cuff to follow the shape of the lower leg increasing comfort and enhancing performance. Tecnica Cochise 110 ski boots also feature removable spoilers and sticky arches designed for hiking in snow.","short_description":"Light on the uphill hike and powerful on the descent, the advanced-level Tecnica Cochise 110 ski boots feature a specialized hiking mode to make it easier to get to untouched powder stashes.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Downhill Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382507.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382507.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382507&tt=df","retail_price":"549.95","sale_price":"384.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382507\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382507.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=858665&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{},"extended_xml_attributes":"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t","categories":["snow","ski-boots","downhill-ski-boots"]}
