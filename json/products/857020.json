{"sku":"857020","manufacturer_id":"SJ140162","brand_name":"Jones","product_name":"Jones Hovercraft Snowboard - 2013/2014","long_description":"The Jones Hovercraft snowboard offers a remarkable amount of float, yet is deisgned to be sized down 6 - 8 cm shorter than your average board. You won't believe how hard this board rips in the pow. Blower, crud and crust are no match for the Hovercraft as it floats through anything without sacrificing maneuverability in mixed conditions. Blunt nose and directional rocker keep you floating while the stiff tail and mellow Magne-Traction lock in stability when the fresh tracks are gone. Directional rocker offers more tip rocker than tail rocker and a slight camber in between the feet; blunt nose offers the float benefits of a longer board without added length. Mello Magne-Traction improves edge grip by adding five contact points along the running length of the board, resulting in amazing control whether riding ice or pow. Robust full wood core offers an even flex and amazing stability on hardpack; it's a true all-terrain core and certified by the Forest Stewardship Council. Wood topsheet; steel edges feature a beveled up edge along the tail for playful control; sintered base is fast and durable, and holds wax for all-day performance. P-tex waste is drastically reduced by flip-flopping base graphic colors between boards; base colors are random, thus specific requests cannot be accommodated. .","short_description":"The Jones Hovercraft snowboard offers a remarkable amount of float, yet is deisgned to be sized down 6 - 8 cm shorter than your average board.
