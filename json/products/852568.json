{"sku":"852568","manufacturer_id":"PP1025","brand_name":"Bushnell","product_name":"Bushnell SolarWrap 250 Solar Power Charger","long_description":"Set the lightweight Bushnell SolarWrap 250 solar power charger out in the sun and start collecting power to charge your smart phone, camera, or almost any other USB device. Flexible and durable solar panel unrolls like a scroll when you want to collect solar power, and rolls up into a protective and easily transportable case when you're done. No sun? no worries-an internal lithium ion battery provides high-capacity power storage and features a micro USB input so it can be pre-charged at home. At a full charge, the internal battery provides enough power to charge most cameras and GPS units 2.5 times, MP3 players twice, or a smart phone once. Two USB outputs let you charge two devices simultaneously. 5-volt/1-amp power output provides the juice you need to charge most mobile devices. The Bushnell SolarWrap 250 solar power charger fully charges in 4 hrs. via micro USB from a wall plug, and in approximately 6 hrs. in direct sunlight.","short_description":"Set the lightweight Bushnell SolarWrap 250 solar power charger out in the sun and start collecting power to charge your smart phone, camera, or almost any other USB device.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Camp Electronics","product_group":"Solar And Portable Power","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s413191.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l413191.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=413191&tt=df","retail_price":"150.00","sale_price":"150.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=413191\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m413191.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=852568&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8525680001":{"sku":"8525680001","vendor_sku":"PP1025","upc":"029757002112","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"150.00","sale_price":"150.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","camp-electronics","solar-and-portable-power"]}
