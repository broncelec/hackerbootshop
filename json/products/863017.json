{"sku":"863017","manufacturer_id":"9900","brand_name":"Cycleops","product_name":"CycleOps Wind Bike Trainer - 2014","long_description":"When riding outside isn't an option, the CycleOps Wind Bike Trainer offers simple, progressive resistance at a great value. Fan blades on flywheel use surrounding air as natural resistance; weight of flywheel also offers smooth starts and slow-downs, offering a road-like feel. Sturdy trainer frame features folding legs for compact storage or transportation. Bike mounts to the trainer by way of a bolt-action locking mechanism that clamps around an included quick-release skewer, enabling a secure, stable connection to the trainer. Please note: because the resistance unit of the CycleOps Wind Bike Trainer is a fan, a higher level of noise is normal. Updated frame works with all standard wheels and now works with 29er mountain bike wheels (fits most treads to 2.25 in.).","short_description":"When riding outside isn't an option, the CycleOps Wind Bike Trainer offers simple, progressive resistance at a great value.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Accessories","product_group":"Bike Trainers","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s379599.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l379599.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=379599&tt=df","retail_price":"153.00","sale_price":"153.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=379599\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m379599.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=863017&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8630170001":{"sku":"8630170001","vendor_sku":"9900","upc":"012527009664","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"153.00","sale_price":"153.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-accessories","bike-trainers"]}
