Saddle features a long-lasting, abrasion-resistant leather cover and soft, comfortable silicone gel inserts that have differentiated thicknesses around cutout. Large center cutout shifts rider's weight to optimize comfort, avoiding contact with the perineum and relieving pelvic pressure. 10% carbon composite strengthens the lightweight shell without compromising flexibility. Shock-absorbent elastomer inserts between rails and shell help dampen road shocks and vibration. Vanadium-titanium \"Vanox\" alloy rails are lighter than titanium and offer strong, sturdy performance. The Selle Italia Max Flite Gel Flow saddle is handmade in Italy.","short_description":"Selle Italia Max Flite Gel Flow saddle offers the classic Flite look with modern materials and design, supplying on- and off-road unisex performance.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Components","product_group":"Bike Saddles And Seatposts","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s444299.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l444299.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=444299&tt=df","retail_price":"189.00","sale_price":"189.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=444299\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m444299.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=818889&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8188890001":{"sku":"8188890001","vendor_sku":"20I024H5040KC00","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"189.00","sale_price":"189.00"}}}
