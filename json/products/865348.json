{"sku":"865348","manufacturer_id":"BTMWLLL14","brand_name":"Big Agnes","product_name":" Big Agnes Wind Lip Sleeping Bag","long_description":"Providing warmth down to 28degF, the Big Agnes Wind Lip Sleeping Bag is ideal for lightweight 3-season backpacking thanks to vertical baffles that prevent the synthetic insulation from shifting. Pinneco Core(R) synthetic insulation is designed to keep you warm with a CoreScreen(TM) heat-reflective layer that is sandwiched between 2 layers of insulation. CoreScreen reflects heat back to your body while allowing moisture to pass from the inside out so you stay dry. Insotect Tubic(TM) construction features internal Flow Gates(TM), which are vertical chambers with internal mesh gates that keep insulation from shifting up and down. Insotect Tubic tubular insulation system is engineered to provide the maximum cubic loft for excellent warmth. Mummy-style bag features full insulation on the bag's underside with no integrated pad sleeve as on other Big Agnes bags. Ripstop nylon shell has a water-repellent finish to shed water. Nylon taffeta lining is soft and breathable; interior fabric loops stabilize a sleeping bag liner, sold separately. 2-way, full-length YKK zipper zips to other bags of opposite configuration. Big Agnes Wind Lip Sleeping Bag includes a mesh storage sack and a nylon stuff sack.","short_description":"Providing warmth down to 28degF, the Big Agnes Wind Lip Sleeping Bag is ideal for lightweight 3-season backpacking thanks to vertical baffles that prevent the synthetic insulation from shifting.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags And Accessories","product_group":"Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s421707.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l421707.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=421707&tt=df","keywords":"compact","retail_price":"189.95","sale_price":"189.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=421707\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m421707.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=865348&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8653480001":{"sku":"8653480001","vendor_sku":"BTMWLRL14","upc":"873840011532","size":"Regular Left","color":"ORANGE/GRAY","retail_price":"169.95","sale_price":"169.95"},"8653480002":{"sku":"8653480002","vendor_sku":"BTMWLLL14","upc":"873840011549","size":"Long Left","color":"ORANGE/GRAY","retail_price":"189.95","sale_price":"189.95"}}}
