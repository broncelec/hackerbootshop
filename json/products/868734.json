{"sku":"868734","manufacturer_id":"5321639","brand_name":"Alps Mountaineering","product_name":"ALPS Mountaineering Meramac 3 Tent - Special Buy","long_description":"Built for 3 people (or 2 and a dog), the freestanding ALPS Mountaineering Meramac 3 Tent provides a comfortable, reliable campground setup. Shockcorded fiberglass poles are one size larger than normal for strength and sturdiness. Polyester taffeta body and fly are lightweight yet long-lasting. Walls have been left uncoated so the tent can breathe under the urethane-coated fly, which reduces condensation buildup. Center fly pole creates an awning over each door; full-coverage rainfly ensures excellent rain protection. Factory-sealed seams on the floor and fly increase water repellency. 2 doors allow easy entry and exit, so you don't have to crawl over others to get in and out. Second door also aids cross-ventilation in hot weather. Mesh storage pockets and gear loft keep small items organized. Stakes and guylines are included with the ALPS Mountaineering Meramac 3 Tent. Special buy.","short_description":"Built for 3 people (or 2 and a dog), the freestanding ALPS Mountaineering Meramac 3 Tent provides a comfortable, reliable campground setup.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Tents","product_group":"Camping Tents","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s449163.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l449163.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=449163&tt=df","retail_price":"129.99","sale_price":"89.73","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=449163\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m449163.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=868734&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8687340001":{"sku":"8687340001","vendor_sku":"5321639","upc":"486873400015","color":"SAGE/RUST","retail_price":"89.73","sale_price":"89.73"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","tents","camping-tents"]}
