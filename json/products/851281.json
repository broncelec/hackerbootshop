{"sku":"851281","manufacturer_id":"1010305231","brand_name":"Tifosi","product_name":" Tifosi Podium S Fototec Photochromic Sunglasses - Men's","long_description":"The Tifosi Podium S Fototec(TM) Photochromic Sunglasses are ready for any adventure, from predawn runs to cycling in the glaring sun. Fototec lenses automatically adjust tint according to light conditions; lenses darken in bright light and lighten in dim conditions. Lightweight and virtually shatterproof, polycarbonate lenses are 20 times more impact-resistant than glass and one-third the weight. Grilamid(R) TR90 lightweight nylon frames offer a consistent fit and flexibility in all temperatures and are extremely impact-resistant. Rubber nosepiece and temple ends become tackier when wet for reliable grip during exercise and hot weather; nosepiece is easily removed. Ventilated lenses increase airflow to help eliminate fogging. Interchangeable design allows you to swap out lenses when the lighting changes (additional lenses not included). Fits small to large profiles. Tifosi Podium Fototec Photochromic Sunglasses include a semirigid carrying case and cleaning cloth.","short_description":"The Tifosi Podium S Fototec(TM) Photochromic Sunglasses are ready for any adventure, from predawn runs to cycling in the glaring sun.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sunglasses","product_group":"Sport Sunglasses","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s423163.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l423163.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=423163&tt=df","keywords":"Cycling","retail_price":"79.95","sale_price":"79.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=423163\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m423163.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=851281&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8512810001":{"sku":"8512810001","vendor_sku":"1010305231","upc":"848869000263","size":"LIGHT NIGHT FOTOTEC","color":"GLOSS CARBON","retail_price":"79.95","sale_price":"79.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sunglasses","sport-sunglasses"]}
