Filter physically removes parasites, protozoa and bacteria down to 0.2 microns in size, including giardia, salmonella, cryptosporidia and others. Output is approximately 1 liter per min. to get your filtering done quickly. Integrated bottle adapter at the bottom of the filter fits most water bottles, including Nalgene bottles (sold separately). Ceramic element provides up to 50,000 liters (13,000 gal.) of clean drinking water, while the carbon cartridge is good for up to 400 liters (106 gal.). Ceramic element and carbon cartridge can both be cleaned to maintain good performance. Pre-filter at hose inlet removes larger contaminants before they reach the main filter to increase its life span. Use the Katadyn Combi filter with the optional Faucet Mount adapter (sold separately) to treat water directly from a kitchen faucet or RV faucet.","short_description":"The Katadyn Combi filter combines a silver-impregnated ceramic element with a refillable, activated-carbon cartridge to give you clean, great-tasting water on your backpacking trips.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Water Bottles And Treatment","product_group":"Water Treatment","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s426391.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l426391.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=426391&tt=df","retail_price":"219.95","sale_price":"219.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=426391\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m426391.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=847730&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8477300001":{"sku":"8477300001","vendor_sku":"8017763","upc":"604375160996","retail_price":"219.95","sale_price":"219.95"}}}
