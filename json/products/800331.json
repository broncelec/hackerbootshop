A unique interchangeable lens system lets you switch lenses without having to put your fingers all over them. Frame includes 1 set of polarized gray lenses and 1 set of SportFlex(TM) lenses, for a total of 2 sets of lenses. Additional SportFlex orange-yellow lenses have a blue mirror coating suitable for cloudy or overcast days, and dusk and dawn. Polarized Crystal Carbonate(R) lenses have the strongest hard coating available to protect against scratching. P.C.C.(R) lenses pass the rigorous ANSI Z80.3 tests for optical clarity and impact resistance while blocking 100% of harmful UVA and UVB light. Extremely lightweight and flexible Rhyno-Tuff(R) AIR frames are engineered to endure extreme temperatures. Anti-Ocular Intrusion System(R), a 4-point configuration, helps prevent lenses from shooting into your face in the event of high-velocity impact. Cam-action spring hinges allow the temples to quickly lock into position. Self-adjusting Cushinol(TM) nosepads and ear stems create a nonslip grip that keeps sunglasses in place, ensuring a soft feel and personalized fit. Venting system incorporated into the frames enhances airflow and virtually eliminates fog and condensation. Also included is an Optic Gear Kit that features a semi-rigid zippered case and a soft pouch that doubles as a cleaning cloth. Best fits a medium to a large profile.","short_description":"Native Eyewear makes some of the most technically advanced sunglasses, including the Hardtop Reflex polarized sunglasses for wind, dirt, sun and glare protection.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sunglasses","product_group":"Sport Sunglasses","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s422855.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l422855.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=422855&tt=df","keywords":"Cycling","retail_price":"149.00","sale_price":"149.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=422855\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m422855.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=800331&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8003310011":{"sku":"8003310011","vendor_sku":"118 349 521","upc":"764824003486","color":"SMOKE/SILVER REFLEX","retail_price":"149.00","sale_price":"149.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sunglasses","sport-sunglasses"]}
