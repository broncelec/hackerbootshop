With a 15degF temperature rating, the Blue Kazoo is suitable for 3-season backpacking trips. Anti-compression pads are body mapped to protect the areas where your body makes the most contact with the ground and to create an insulating buffer. Women-specific fit and design places more insulation around the chest and feet for optimal warmth. Shaped hood helps retain warmth. Draft collar and zipper baffle prevent heat loss. Pad loops give you a way to attach the bag to a sleeping pad (sold separately). The North Face Blue Kazoo Sleeping Bag comes with a compression sack and storage sack.","short_description":"A 3-season bag that's coveted by mountaineers and backpackers, The North Face Blue Kazoo Sleeping Bag for women is filled with water-resistant 650-fill down for reliable warmth down to 15degF.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags And Accessories","product_group":"Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s421691.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l421691.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=421691&tt=df","keywords":"compact","retail_price":"289.00","sale_price":"289.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=421691\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m421691.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=864552&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8645520002":{"sku":"8645520002","vendor_sku":"A1Q6M4P","upc":"715752282375","size":"Long Right","color":"CAPRI BREEZE BLUE/ASPHALT","retail_price":"289.00","sale_price":"289.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sleeping-bags-and-accessories","sleeping-bags"]}
