{"sku":"858533","manufacturer_id":"10689100000","brand_name":"Burton","product_name":"Burton Custom X Snowboard - 2013/2014","long_description":"As an aggressive all-mountain rider, you know you need stability and control when ripping down the slopes and landing big drops. The Burton Custom X snowboard gives you exactly what you need. The Custom X combines razor-sharp response and catlike edge control with featherlight weight; this board is supercharged with snap and stability. Snappy camber distributes weight evenly over the entire length of the board for smooth continuous edge control from tip to tail, poppy precision and powerful turning. Directional shape concentrates pop in the tail and offers plenty of overall float and control; twin flex makes riding regular or switch simple. The Channel system offers unlimited, on-the-fly stance adjustability and enhances board feel; compatible with EST(TM), Re:Flex(TM) and Disc(R) bindings. The Channel lets you fine-tune your stance width to the millimeter, and then dial in your toe-to-heel centering and rotate your angles in one fell swoop. 500 independent laminations, each individually oriented within the core, result in superior weight savings, strength and energized response. Multi-zone wood grains run perpendicular to the core adjacent to the Channel (where your power emanates) for ultimate strength and edge control. Fiberglass energy strands radiate outward from the Channels to the board's edges, providing driving power and effortless response. Lightweight Carbon I-Beam(TM) riding up the board's spine adds to board's longitudinal snap. Squeezbox tech transfers energy outward from under your feet, energizing the tip and tail for added snap when exiting a turn and ollieing. Tapered tip and tail thickness reduces swing weight and improves powder flotation. Edges extend out slightly beneath the bindings for tremendous edge hold in hard, icy conditions, but they remain playful and forgiving in softer conditions.","short_description":"As an aggressive all-mountain rider, you know you need stability and control when ripping down the slopes and landing big drops.
