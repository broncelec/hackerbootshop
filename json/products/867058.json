{"sku":"867058","manufacturer_id":"594","brand_name":"Sea To Summit","product_name":" Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil Compression Dry Sack","long_description":"The lightweight, waterproof Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil(R) Compression Dry Sack compresses your clothing and gear to 1/3 the volume while keeping it dry. This valve-free dry sack uses a breathable base made of waterproof eVent(R) fabric, which allows air to be pushed out, but keeps water from entering. Waterproof seams are double stitched and fully taped for excellent durability and resistance to moisture. Roll-top Hypalon(R) closure with lid and 4 straps evenly compresses and maintains compressed size. The Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil Compression Dry Sack is roughly half the weight of the original Sea to Summit eVent Compression Dry Sack.","short_description":"The lightweight, waterproof Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil(R) Compression Dry Sack compresses your clothing and gear to 1/3 the volume while keeping it dry.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Gear Storage And Maintenance","product_group":"Stuff Sacks","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s419387.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l419387.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=419387&tt=df","retail_price":"47.95","sale_price":"47.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=419387\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m419387.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=867058&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8670580001":{"sku":"8670580001","vendor_sku":"591","size":"6 LTR","color":"GRAY","retail_price":"31.95","sale_price":"31.95"},"8670580002":{"sku":"8670580002","vendor_sku":"592","size":"10 LTR","color":"GRAY","retail_price":"37.95","sale_price":"37.95"},"8670580003":{"sku":"8670580003","vendor_sku":"593","size":"14 LTR","color":"GRAY","retail_price":"42.95","sale_price":"42.95"},"8670580004":{"sku":"8670580004","vendor_sku":"594","size":"20 LTR","color":"GRAY","retail_price":"47.95","sale_price":"47.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","gear-storage-and-maintenance","stuff-sacks"]}
