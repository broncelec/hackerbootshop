Teter Pro frame has a Pink SQ lens with a rose tint and 35% visible light transmission (VLT) to enhance contrast and depth perception in flat light. Chop-A2 frame has a bronze-tinted Red Solex lens with a red mirror and 25% VLT to maximize color definition and increase depth perception in medium to bright light. Large spherical lens tapers from the optical center toward the periphery for a wide field of vision with minimal distortion. Antifog treatment and full-perimeter venting combat lens fogging. 3-layer face foam is constructed of a dense base, a plush mid layer and a soft fleece top layer; design ensures a tight seal, good moisture management and maximum comfort. Tough thermoplastic polyurethane frame offers consistent flexibility in changing temperatures for a comfortable, secure fit. Sleek, low-profile strap outriggers hinge to create a flush fit that minimizes gaps and comfortably distributes pressure evenly across your face.
