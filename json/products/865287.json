{"sku":"865287","manufacturer_id":"14M360246","brand_name":"Vibram","product_name":"Vibram FiveFingers KMD Sport LS Shoes - Men's","long_description":"For running and gym workouts, the men's Vibram FiveFingers KMD Sport LS Shoes offer a natural barefoot feel, and they have a quick-lace setup that accommodates wide feet and high insteps. Zero drop from heel to toe encourages a natural midfoot or forefoot strike to promote forward momentum and reduce the impact of heel striking. Stretchy uppers hug feet and offer quick-drying comfort; breathable stretch-mesh panels keep debris and grit out. Quick-lace closure system and locking buckle allow for a comfortable custom fit with just one easy pull. Individual toe slots enhance dexterity, control and stability to help deliver a natural motion. AEGIS Microbe Shield(R) antimicrobial treatment helps control odor development. Seamless 2mm polyurethane footbeds reduce friction underfoot; EVA arch shanks help provide light support. 4mm Vibram outsoles are made of nonmarking Vibram TC1 rubber and feature traction pods that follow the contours of your feet and toes for enhanced traction. Recommended for running and fitness; in order to allow your feet to adapt to using different muscles, gradually increase usage of these shoes. The Vibram FiveFingers KMD Sport LS Shoes are machine washable in cold water; air dry only. To determine size, stand with heels against a wall and measure from the wall to the tip of the longest toe; use the longest toe length in conjunction with the size chart.","short_description":"For running and gym workouts, the men's Vibram FiveFingers KMD Sport LS Shoes offer a natural barefoot feel, and they have a quick-lace setup that accommodates wide feet and high insteps.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Men's Footwear","product_group":"Men's Shoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s386131.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l386131.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=386131&tt=df","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=386131\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m386131.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=865287&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8652870002":{"sku":"8652870002","vendor_sku":"14M360241","upc":"847100044097","size":"41","color":"BLACK/SILVER/GREY","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"8652870003":{"sku":"8652870003","vendor_sku":"14M360242","upc":"847100044103","size":"42","color":"BLACK/SILVER/GREY","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"8652870005":{"sku":"8652870005","vendor_sku":"14M360244","upc":"847100044127","size":"44","color":"BLACK/SILVER/GREY","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"8652870006":{"sku":"8652870006","vendor_sku":"14M360245","upc":"847100044134","size":"45","color":"BLACK/SILVER/GREY","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"}},"categories":["footwear","mens-footwear","mens-shoes"]}
