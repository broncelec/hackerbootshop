{"sku":"864976","manufacturer_id":"10227-4","brand_name":"Saucony","product_name":" Saucony Guide 7 Road-Running Shoes - Women's","long_description":"The women's Saucony Guide 7 Road-Running Shoes are some of the lightest in their class, yet provide excellent stability and cushioning, to keep you moving fast and feeling strong on your long runs. Guide 7 shoes work for lots of runners and are perfect for mild overpronators, as well as neutral runners who want just a little extra support. Lightweight, highly breathable mesh uppers feature synthetic leather overlays for structure and durability. Nylon linings breathe well, wick moisture and dry quickly to keep your feet cool and comfortable. PowerGrid foam cushions the entire surface of the foot, ensuring a comfortable ride throughout the stride. Shoes are engineered to be stable with SRC Crashpads that ease the heels to the ground and absorb impact without levering the feet too much. 8mm heel-to-toe drop positions this shoe as a transition between a barefoot style and a traditional running shoe. Saucony Guide 7 Road-Running Shoes have an active fit that adjusts to the shape of your foot while you're running.","short_description":"The women's Saucony Guide 7 Road-Running Shoes are some of the lightest in their class, yet provide excellent stability and cushioning, to keep you moving fast and feeling strong on your long runs.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Women's Footwear","product_group":"Women's Shoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s387867.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l387867.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=387867&tt=df","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=387867\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m387867.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=864976&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8649760001":{"sku":"8649760001","vendor_sku":"10227-4","upc":"801100168733","size":"6","color":"GREY/BLUE/CITRON","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8649760002":{"sku":"8649760002","vendor_sku":"10227-4","upc":"801100168740","size":"6.5","color":"GREY/BLUE/CITRON","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8649760003":{"sku":"8649760003","vendor_sku":"10227-4","upc":"801100168757","size":"7","color":"GREY/BLUE/CITRON","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8649760004":{"sku":"8649760004","vendor_sku":"10227-4","upc":"720026864621","size":"7.5","color":"GREY/BLUE/CITRON","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8649760005":{"sku":"8649760005","vendor_sku":"10227-4","upc":"720026864638","size":"8","color":"GREY/BLUE/CITRON","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8649760006":{"sku":"8649760006","vendor_sku":"10227-4","upc":"720026864645","size":"8.5","color":"GREY/BLUE/CITRON","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8649760007":{"sku":"8649760007","vendor_sku":"10227-4","upc":"720026864652","size":"9","color":"GREY/BLUE/CITRON","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8649760008":{"sku":"8649760008","vendor_sku":"10227-4","upc":"720026864669","size":"9.5","color":"GREY/BLUE/CITRON","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8649760009":{"sku":"8649760009","vendor_sku":"10227-4","upc":"720026864676","size":"10","color":"GREY/BLUE/CITRON","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8649760010":{"sku":"8649760010","vendor_sku":"10227-4","upc":"720026864683","size":"10.5","color":"GREY/BLUE/CITRON","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8649760011":{"sku":"8649760011","vendor_sku":"10227-4","upc":"720026864690","size":"11","color":"GREY/BLUE/CITRON","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"}},"categories":["footwear","womens-footwear","womens-shoes"]}
