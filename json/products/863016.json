{"sku":"863016","manufacturer_id":"9906","brand_name":"Cycleops","product_name":" CycleOps Fluid2 Power Training Kit - 2014","long_description":"Make every workout count with the CycleOps Fluid2 Power Training kit. It includes a Fluid2 bike trainer with a bike computer and a heart rate-based power meter to measure performance. There are no manual adjustments needed, simply shift gears as you would when riding outside to increase or decrease the resistance, and the faster you pedal the harder it gets. Spin along with virtually no resistance or hammer out a 2000-watt sprint-you will never outgrow this trainer no matter what training you require. With a quick load cam lever, you simply adjust the resistance once and then lock it into place so there is no guessing each time you put your bike on the trainer. Combine this with a smooth, quiet ride, locking bolt ring and heavy-duty steel construction, and you're ready to sprint, spin and climb with confidence. The Cyclops Fluid2 bike trainer features adjustable foot pads, a quick release handle, self-cooling mechanism and folding legs for storage. Updated frame works with all standard wheels and now works with 29er mountain bike wheels (fits most treads to 2.25 in.). A CycleOps Joule bike computer is included in the kit and, thanks to its customizable interface, you can tailor the screen to display any of 18 metrics, including power. Included CycleOps PowerCal Power Meter chest strap uses heart rate to estimate output and translates data into of watts, kilojoules and peak power to aid training. CycleOps Speed Sensor is also included, which can be configured to detect speed or cadence on your bike. CycleOps Fluid2 Power Training kit comes with Fluid2 trainer, PowerCal chest strap, Joule cycling computer and a speed/cadence sensor.","short_description":"Make every workout count with the CycleOps Fluid2 Power Training kit.
