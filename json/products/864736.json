It's a great pack and a great value. This well-designed pack features heavy load handling, quick access to an ultra-adjustable suspension, and women-specific contours and sizing in the harness. Not just a small men's pack, it features a slim width and a short height, and its anatomic, ergonomic shoulder straps and hipbelt fit a woman's shape. With a rip-and-stick torso adjustment, shoulder strap system easily slides along pack's frame to fit torsos of varying lengths. Precurved shoulder straps match your anatomy for non-binding comfort on and off the trail. Dual-density foam padded back panel provides a comfortable and supportive fit when carrying heavy loads. Precurved hipbelt is designed to cradle hip bones for a natural fit and to distribute weight without sagging. Hipbelt webbing system allows you to use a natural forward pulling motion for quick, easy cinching and precise adjustment. Enjoy dual access to pack via the top-loading opening and the horseshoe-shape, zippered front panel opening, which works like a duffel opening. Removable top lid pocket with water-repellent zipper lets you stash the essentials you want to bring into the tent; pack can stay outside or in the vestibule. Zippered pocket under the lid stores maps and keys, spare batteries and other small essentials. Front panel features a new and improved stretch-woven zipper pocket with easy access for packing often-used gear. Internal sleeping-bag compartment with a zippered divider separates it from gear and clothes in the main compartment. Utilizing 4 buckles, the pack's streamlined compression system lets you cinch and strap down loads for jostle-free carrying. Concave head pod at the top of pack gives your head freedom of movement-no more staring at the ground.","short_description":"Pack the fuzzy slippers, the newly redesigned REI Venus 70 women's backpack is built to carry all the creature comforts-in comfort!
