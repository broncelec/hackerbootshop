{"sku":"827195","manufacturer_id":"A57YF7H","brand_name":"The North Face","product_name":"The North Face Venture Jacket - Women's","long_description":"The North Face Venture jacket is light and compressible, engineered to withstand severe rain, and styled for everyday use. Venture out and explore, no matter what Mother Nature has in store. The Venture jacket is a staple that every outdoor enthusiast will appreciate. HyVent(R) EC 2.5-layer substitutes natural (bean-derived) castor oil for 50% of the petroleum-based materials previously used in the manufacturing process. HyVent EC maintains excellent waterproof, breathable performance; it's ideal for spring skiing and snowboarding, as well as urban and city hiking. HyVent is lightweight and packable, moves easily over layers and is more breathable than unlined, treated fabrics. All seams are sealed for complete protection. Fully adjustable brimmed hood protects your head from precipitation and allows good visibility; soft lining guards chin against abrasion. Rip-and-stick stormflap prevents weather penetration through the full-length front zipper. Pit zippers allow cooling airflow as your activity heats up. Hem drawcord and elastic cuffs with rip-and-stick closures seal out the weather. Zip hand pockets; jacket stows in left pocket. The North Face Venture has a regular cut for easy layering; slightly long length enhances protection.","short_description":"The North Face Venture jacket is light and compressible, engineered to withstand severe rain, and styled for everyday use.
