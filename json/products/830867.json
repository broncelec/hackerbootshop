Ends have carabiner clips instead of hooks giving you more options for securing items onto pack, bike or kayak. Once adjusted, bungee ends can be secured in place with a wrap-and-lock motion around end of carabiner. Instead of elastic that loses its stretch over time, KnotBone has a durable, high quality cord that threads through each end.
