{"sku":"794289","manufacturer_id":"12629","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":"REI Screen House","long_description":"Don't let the bugs get you down! The REI Screen House is a floorless shelter that offers bug and shade protection, great ventilation and a 360deg view. The Screen House can be positioned over a picnic table or simply set up as a comfortable lounging area. 2 large doors provide full side access when zipped completely open; or create 4 quick entry points when doors are partially zipped. No-see-um mesh doors and walls keep bugs outside where they belong; ripstop nylon roof and nylon taffeta walls create a lightweight, durable structure. Combination pole-sleeve-and-clip setup uses lined mesh sleeves on top and clips on the sides; it's easy to setup and creates a taut pitch. Organizational pockets keep shelter clutter-free; door pockets can also be used to keep small gear close at hand. Multiple guyouts (cords and stakes included) secure the structure and add strength. Includes duffle carry bag for easy packing and transport.","short_description":"Don't let the bugs get you down!
