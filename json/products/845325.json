{"sku":"845325","manufacturer_id":"14462","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":"REI InCamp Shelter","long_description":"The REI InCamp shelter is built with convertability and connections in mind. This strong, freestanding sun/weather shelter can be used on it's own or integrated to form an extended habitat. InCamp Shelter fits perfectly over the door end of the InCamp 4 tent (sold separately) creating both a patio for hanging out and a protected entryway. Add up to 4 REI Shelter Wing accessory panels (sold separately) to create a fully enclosed structure for privacy, wind and rain protection. REI InCamp shelter is easy to set up: hybrid steel/aluminum pre-bent poles with high-strength plastic hubs combine to form a durable frame. Near vertical walls provide areawide headroom for plenty of space to move around. Coated polyester taffeta canopy is waterproof (seam-sealed) and UV-resistant for years of service. Includes a zippered, duffel-style stuff sack, stakes, guylines and tighteners, pole repair tube, and pole and stake bags. REI Shelter Wing accessory panels (sold separately) can be poled out with the REI Adjustable Tarp Poles (sold separately) to create awnings. REI Shelter Wing accessory panels also allow the InCamp Shelter to integrate with vehicles and other tents.","short_description":"The REI InCamp shelter is built with convertability and connections in mind.
