{"sku":"839414","manufacturer_id":"303081","brand_name":"Dalbello","product_name":"Dalbello Sherpa 5/5 Randonee Boots - Men's - 2012/2013","long_description":"The Dalbello Sherpa 5/5 randonee boots provide all the power needed to drive the widest skis, yet they are lightweight and allow great range of motion for long backcountry tours. 3-piece Cabrio shell design ensures a precise foothold and a smooth, progressive flex as you bend your knees into the turn. Separate cuff, shell and tongue sections are joined together to create a smooth forward flex with rigid lateral support. Double-hinge tongues combine with Twin Hinge ski/walk mechanisms for great range of motion while touring; when flexed forward on descents, the 2 tongue pieces lock together. Lightweight liners can be custom molded for an accurate fit; use the laces to really dial in the fit. See an REI ski shop professional to have the liners custom molded to your feet to maximize comfort and performance. Hinge points on the cuffs are placed about 10cm lower than most randonee boots and are designed to allow the boots to follow the natural movement of your legs. Tech components in front and back give the boots Dynafit-style binding compatibility; Sherpa boots are also compatible with step-in style randonee bindings. 3 microadjustable aluminum buckles on each boot secure your feet in place; Dynalink instep closures do not allow your feet to slide forward or lift inside the shells. Boots have a forefoot width of 100mm. Dalbello Sherpa 5/5 randonee boots have lugged Vibram(R) rubber outsoles for good traction on snowy slopes and rocky trails.","short_description":"The Dalbello Sherpa 5/5 randonee boots provide all the power needed to drive the widest skis, yet they are lightweight and allow great range of motion for long backcountry tours.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Randonee Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s461511.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l461511.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=461511&tt=df","retail_price":"599.95","sale_price":"479.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=461511\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m461511.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=839414&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8394140002":{"sku":"8394140002","vendor_sku":"303081","upc":"616438204363","size":"Mondo 26.5","color":"BLUEVETTE/WHITE","retail_price":"479.93","sale_price":"479.93"},"8394140003":{"sku":"8394140003","vendor_sku":"303081","upc":"616438307767","size":"Mondo 27.5","color":"BLUEVETTE/WHITE","retail_price":"479.93","sale_price":"479.93"},"8394140004":{"sku":"8394140004","vendor_sku":"303081","upc":"616438204400","size":"Mondo 28.5","color":"BLUEVETTE/WHITE","retail_price":"479.93","sale_price":"479.93"}},"categories":["snow","ski-boots","randonee-ski-boots"]}
