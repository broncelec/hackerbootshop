{"sku":"859443","manufacturer_id":"LBC2030","brand_name":"Lange","product_name":"Lange RX 130 Ski Boots - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"The advanced-level Lange RX 130 ski boots use high performance, uniform-density plastic shells and snug footbeds for a balance between high-speed precision and a great fit you can enjoy for hours. A stiff flex offers expert skiers a responsive transfer of power from boot to ski. Uniform-density plastic shells ensure highly efficient power transfer, smooth flex and finely-tuned responsiveness, even in frigid temperatures. Shells, liners and snug, 100mm footbeds are based on a composite scan of thousands of skiers' feet for anatomic accuracy and comfort. Shells are designed to create a centered, balanced stance on rockered skis to increase efficiency of technique and reduce fatigue. Control Fit liners conform to your feet for a comfortable, high-performance fit; liners may be custom molded using a heat treatment. Specially designed insteps provide an excellent fit at the midfoot, resulting in increased circulation and greater warmth. 1-piece toe boxes and tongues eliminate seams and overlaps in the tongue-attachment area to reduce pressure points at the instep and top of the toes. Elastic 40mm power straps; rubber soles offer excellent grip.","short_description":"The advanced-level Lange RX 130 ski boots use high performance, uniform-density plastic shells and snug footbeds for a balance between high-speed precision and a great fit you can enjoy for hours.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Downhill Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s461507.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l461507.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=461507&tt=df","retail_price":"649.95","sale_price":"649.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=461507\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m461507.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859443&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8594430001":{"sku":"8594430001","vendor_sku":"LBC2030","size":"Mondo 25.5","color":"WHITE/GREEN/BLACK","retail_price":"649.95","sale_price":"649.95"},"8594430002":{"sku":"8594430002","vendor_sku":"LBC2030","size":"Mondo 26.5","color":"WHITE/GREEN/BLACK","retail_price":"649.95","sale_price":"649.95"},"8594430003":{"sku":"8594430003","vendor_sku":"LBC2030","size":"Mondo 27.5","color":"WHITE/GREEN/BLACK","retail_price":"649.95","sale_price":"649.95"},"8594430004":{"sku":"8594430004","vendor_sku":"LBC2030","size":"Mondo 28.5","color":"WHITE/GREEN/BLACK","retail_price":"649.95","sale_price":"649.95"},"8594430005":{"sku":"8594430005","vendor_sku":"LBC2030","size":"Mondo 29.5","color":"WHITE/GREEN/BLACK","retail_price":"649.95","sale_price":"649.95"}},"categories":["snow","ski-boots","downhill-ski-boots"]}
