{"sku":"826024","manufacturer_id":"13774","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":"REI Kimtah Rain Jacket - Women's","long_description":"The women's REI Kimtah jacket is perfect for spring and summer backpacking adventures. It's made with eVent(R) fabric and offers protection for activities where windy, wet weather is a concern. eVent fabric has a unique membrane structure that allows sweat vapor to quickly escape to the outside of the fabric. No matter how hard you work, overheating is unlikely due to this Direct Venting(TM) technology. And because you remain dry on the inside, the likelihood of an uncomfortable, post-exercise chill is eliminated. eVent technology works so efficiently, no pit zippers are needed; all seams are sealed for complete waterproof protection. Windproof to 60 mph. Fully adjustable brimmed hood features easy-to-use ripcord-style cinches. Includes a full-length, water-resistant front zipper with windflap and chin guard. Features adjustable hem drawcord and snow-resistant rip-and-stick cuff tabs; angled sleeves extend coverage over top of hands. Hand pockets with mesh lining are placed for easy access with a pack on; includes a zip sleeve pocket. Internal stow pocket features an earphone cord port. REI Kimtah jacket has an active fit that allows a full range of motion and enhances performance.","short_description":"The women's REI Kimtah jacket is perfect for spring and summer backpacking adventures.
