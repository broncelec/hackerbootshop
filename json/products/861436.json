{"sku":"861436","manufacturer_id":"16425","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":"REI Flash 18 Pack","long_description":"Ultralight and ultra-versatile, the updated REI Flash 18 Pack cleverly converts into a stuff sack simply by turning it inside out. All-purpose daypack is handy in town, on trails and for short hikes away from basecamp; turn it inside out to create a stuff sack that helps organize gear inside a big pack. Lightly padded stretch-mesh shoulder straps move freely. Removable back panel pad doubles as a sit pad; hipbelt and sternum strap can also be detached. Sternum-strap buckle doubles as a safety whistle. Interior zippered pocket secures keys and other small items. Hydration-compatible design has a hose exit port and an internal sleeve to hold a hydration reservoir (sold separately). Updated drawcord closure is designed to fully cover the top opening when cinched tight. The REI Flash 18 Pack also has 2 daisy chains that let you attach items on the front.","short_description":"Ultralight and ultra-versatile, the updated REI Flash 18 Pack cleverly converts into a stuff sack simply by turning it inside out.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Backpacks","product_group":"Day Packs","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s411303.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l411303.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=411303&tt=df","retail_price":"34.50","sale_price":"34.50","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=411303\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m411303.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=861436&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8614360001":{"sku":"8614360001","vendor_sku":"16425","upc":"486143600015","color":"BLAZE RED","retail_price":"34.50","sale_price":"34.50"},"8614360002":{"sku":"8614360002","vendor_sku":"16425","upc":"486143600022","color":"INDIAN OCEAN","retail_price":"34.50","sale_price":"34.50"},"8614360003":{"sku":"8614360003","vendor_sku":"16425","upc":"486143600039","color":"DRAGON FRUIT","retail_price":"34.50","sale_price":"34.50"},"8614360004":{"sku":"8614360004","vendor_sku":"16425","upc":"486143600046","color":"BLACK/BLACK","retail_price":"34.50","sale_price":"34.50"},"8614360005":{"sku":"8614360005","vendor_sku":"16425","upc":"486143600053","color":"BRIGHT COBALT","retail_price":"34.50","sale_price":"34.50"},"8614360006":{"sku":"8614360006","vendor_sku":"16425","upc":"486143600060","color":"CANDY GREEN","retail_price":"34.50","sale_price":"34.50"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","backpacks","day-packs"]}
