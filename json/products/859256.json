{"sku":"859256","manufacturer_id":"L35369500","brand_name":"Salomon","product_name":" Salomon Guardian WTR 13L Randonee Bindings","long_description":"Go from the resort straight to the backcountry with the Salomon Guardian WTR 13L randonee bindings. They have the feel of alpine bindings, with the benefit of being able to tour in the backcountry. Switching from hike to ski mode shouldn't be a hassle, and it isn't with the Guardian bindings-simply flick the switches with your ski poles to change modes. Aggressive skiers who like to cruise at high speeds will appreciate the adjustable DIN that ranges from 5 to 13. Bindings have a low overall stand height of 26mm for great stability while skiing. 80mm width transmits power from your boots to your wide skis for great downhill performance. Bindings include brakes that come off with a single turn of a screw driver if you need to remove them; choose between 100 or 115mm-wide brakes depending on your ski width. Choose the size that's just wider than the underfoot width of your skis; for example, choose 115mm size for 110mm-waisted skis. Toe-piece height can be adjusted to fit your boots. Flip the climbing bars up with your ski poles to take some stress off your legs when you're skinning uphill. Salomon Guardian WTR 13L randonee bindings fit boot sizes Mondo 26.5 and larger; bindings are only compatible with boots with alpine DIN soles or WTR soles.","short_description":"Go from the resort straight to the backcountry with the Salomon Guardian WTR 13L randonee bindings.
