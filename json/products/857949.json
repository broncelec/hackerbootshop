{"sku":"857949","manufacturer_id":"VN-0UEM10S","brand_name":"Vans","product_name":"Vans Infuse Snowboard Boots - 2013/2014","long_description":"If you're a hard-charging, all-mountain rider serious about performance, Vans Infuse snowboard boots offer top-of-the-line features, an amazing fit and classic Vans styling. Vans Hybrid Boa lacing offers the best of both worlds: it combines traditional laces with a Boa closure that focuses primarily on the critical instep area of the boots. This configuration allows you to lace your boots tighter than with traditional laces only, and it also allows on-the-fly instep adjustments for boot flex. Custom Boa dials celebrate the partnership between Vans and Boa, and feature a diamond texture and sidestripe detailing. Power cuff strap brings liner and shell cuffs together for a perfect fit around your calves. Full-grain leather uppers feature a waterproof treatment for all-day protection from the elements. Custom X thermal liners have an exterior overlay support cage that provides leg and ankle support for an anatomic and supportive fit. Direct-connect rip-and-stick closures and cuff straps prevent liner movement. Internal web harnesses hold liners closed for secure fit and prevent them from slipping inside shells; lace locks maintain desired tension. Molded cork/recycled EVA high-rebound footbeds feature integrated arch support, dual-density metatarsal and heel impact-relief pads and Outlast-treated topsheets. Aggressive tacky rubber outsoles feature a hex-lug pattern for maximum traction; skate-style silhouette offers a low-profile fit for a true connection to your board. Each Vans Infuse boot has 2 RECCO(R) reflectors that enhance radio signals from search-and-rescue Recco detectors for quicker location in an avalanche.","short_description":"If you're a hard-charging, all-mountain rider serious about performance, Vans Infuse snowboard boots offer top-of-the-line features, an amazing fit and classic Vans styling.","category":"Snowboarding","subcategory":"Snowboard Boots","product_group":"Men's Snowboard Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s383119.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l383119.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=383119&tt=df","retail_price":"369.95","sale_price":"236.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=383119\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m383119.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=857949&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8579490002":{"sku":"8579490002","vendor_sku":"VN-0UEM10S","upc":"887682050802","size":"9.5","color":"BROWN/YELLOW","retail_price":"236.83","sale_price":"236.83"},"8579490006":{"sku":"8579490006","vendor_sku":"VN-0UEM10S","upc":"887682050703","size":"11.5","color":"BROWN/YELLOW","retail_price":"236.83","sale_price":"236.83"},"8579490007":{"sku":"8579490007","vendor_sku":"VN-0UEM10S","upc":"887682050710","size":"12","color":"BROWN/YELLOW","retail_price":"236.83","sale_price":"236.83"}},"categories":["snow","snowboard-boots","mens-snowboard-boots"]}
