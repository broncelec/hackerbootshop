{"sku":"728362","manufacturer_id":"1140","brand_name":"Voile","product_name":" Voile Splitboard Crampon","long_description":"For super-steep or icy ascents use these Voile(R) crampons with skins; crampons can be fixed or mobile depending on terrain. Crampon fixed mode is best for high exposure where security in every step is essential. Mobile mode is for more moderate ascents, allowing crampon to rise with each step for increased energy efficiency by lessening drag. Universal fit for either board half with inside dimension of 13.7cm (for a Voile 182 Split board will require right/left crampon). Works with Voile, Prior and split-your-own-boards; includes a nylon storage bag, but skins are not included.","short_description":"For super-steep or icy ascents use these Voile(R) crampons with skins; crampons can be fixed or mobile depending on terrain.","category":"Snowboarding","subcategory":"Snowboard Bindings","product_group":"Snowboard Binding Accessories","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382859.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382859.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382859&tt=df","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382859\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382859.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=728362&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7283620016":{"sku":"7283620016","vendor_sku":"1140","upc":"759948114019","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"}}}
