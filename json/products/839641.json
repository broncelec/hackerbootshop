{"sku":"839641","manufacturer_id":"BD1121350000120","brand_name":"Black Diamond","product_name":" Black Diamond Ultra Distance Z-Pole Trekking Poles - Pair","long_description":"The amazingly light Black Diamond Ultra Distance Z-Pole trekking poles incorporate a simple yet cutting-edge folding design that's ideal for thru-hikers, endurance runners and fast-packers. Innovative folding Z-Pole system offers simple, compact and reliable support with a concealed inner cord, single push-button release and speed cone deployment. A quick pull on the grip, and the first pole section snaps and locks the 3 pole sections into place; flexible tube ends protect the Kevlar(R) center cord when folded. Easily replace and solidly secure pole tips with WaveLock(TM) tip connections. Right- and left-hand-specific straps are light, breathable and moisture-wicking; they feature breathable cutout windows and easy rip-and-stick adjustability. Inspired by snow probes, speed cones at the end of each pole section ensure strength, stability and super-fast deployment; each speed cone guides a pole section into place. Light, non-slip EVA foam grips feature foam extensions that allow poles to be held low during short side hill traverses. 100% carbon fiber shafts offer ultralight perfomance. Pole baskets feature shaft catchers to secure pole sections when folded. Black Diamond Ultra Distance Z-Pole trekking poles come with interchangeable, nonmarking rubber tips, carbide tips and a stow bag. Note: these three-season poles feature fixed baskets.","short_description":"The amazingly light Black Diamond Ultra Distance Z-Pole trekking poles incorporate a simple yet cutting-edge folding design that's ideal for thru-hikers, endurance runners and fast-packers.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Gadgets","product_group":"Trekking Poles And Hiking Staffs","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s418811.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l418811.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=418811&tt=df","keywords":"collapsible","retail_price":"159.95","sale_price":"159.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=418811\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m418811.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=839641&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8396410001":{"sku":"8396410001","vendor_sku":"BD1121350000100","upc":"793661175216","size":"100 CM","color":"CARBON/BLUE","retail_price":"159.95","sale_price":"159.95"},"8396410002":{"sku":"8396410002","vendor_sku":"BD1121350000110","upc":"793661175223","size":"110 CM","color":"CARBON/BLUE","retail_price":"159.95","sale_price":"159.95"},"8396410003":{"sku":"8396410003","vendor_sku":"BD1121350000120","upc":"793661175230","size":"120 CM","color":"CARBON/BLUE","retail_price":"159.95","sale_price":"159.95"},"8396410004":{"sku":"8396410004","vendor_sku":"BD1121350000130","upc":"793661175247","size":"130 CM","color":"CARBON/BLUE","retail_price":"159.95","sale_price":"159.95"}}}
