Horizontal baffles are insulated with high-loft, lightweight PrimaLoft(R) Infinity insulation for great warmth on cold nights. Integrated pump lets you inflate the pad by hand rather than by mouth; 2 flat valves won't get in the way, and they allow for quick inflation and deflation. Pad can be easily and quickly connected to another REI InCamp Insulated air pad via the 3 low-profile buckles on the side. Brushed polyester surface has a soft hand and resists slipping; 75-denier polyester bottom resists wear and tear. Fully welded construction is leakproof. The REI InCamp Insulated air pad comes with a stuff sack to keep the pad protected and stowed compactly when you're on the trail.","short_description":"Sleep well on car-camping adventures with the warm and comfortable REI InCamp Insulated air pad.","category":"Camping & Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Pads","product_group":"Sleeping Pads","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s290543.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l290543.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=290543&tt=df","keywords":"sleeping pad,pad,sleep,mat,sleeping","retail_price":"139.00","sale_price":"139.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=290543\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m290543.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=845301&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8453010001":{"sku":"8453010001","vendor_sku":"14475","upc":"484530100018","size":"Regular","color":"MESA ORANGE","retail_price":"139.00","sale_price":"139.00"}}}
