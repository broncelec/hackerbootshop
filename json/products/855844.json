{"sku":"855844","manufacturer_id":"10027100","brand_name":"Burton","product_name":" Burton Hackett Insulated Jacket - Men's","long_description":"At first glance, the Burton Hackett insulated jacket looks and feels like heavy-duty work flannel. Dig deeper and you'll discover a waterproof coating and warm insulation that battle snow and cold. DRYRIDE Durashell(TM) 2-layer coated nylon shell with critically taped seams provides windproof and waterproof, breathable protection from the elements. 40g 3M(TM) Thinsulate insulation is placed strategically throughout the jacket to retain warmth and keep you comfortable on cold days. Breathable taffeta lining keeps warmth inside and wicks away moisture. Contoured, adjustable fleece hood fits the shape of your head, providing good warmth without obstructing vision. Removable waist gaiter with jacket-to-pants interface creates a barrier against snow entry with compatible Burton pants (sold separately). Includes zippered hand pockets, two snap-close chest pockets, two internal stash pockets and an internal goggles/media pocket. Wrist gussets have thumbholes to help keep your wrists warm and prevent cold air from getting in. The Burton Hackett jacket is built for layering without being overly baggy; sleeves are designed with a bit of extra length to fit over your gloves and keep snow out.","short_description":"At first glance, the Burton Hackett insulated jacket looks and feels like heavy-duty work flannel.
