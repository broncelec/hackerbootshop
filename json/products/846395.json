High-quality Cree XP-G LED operates in 5 brightness levels to meet your lighting needs(TM)low, mid, high, turbo and red output. Turbo gives you 5 min. of use with a maximum output of 200 lumens; after 5 min. the light automatically switches to high. Use the single red LED to preserve night vision while hanging out at camp or making your way down the trail. Strobe function outputs 45 lumens and is handy for signaling. Regulated output maintains consistent light output over the lifetime of the batteries. Memory circuit automatically locks the brightness level when you turn the light off so when you turn it back on it's at the same level. IPX6 water resistance rating ensures the headlamp will operate in bad weather. Fenix HL30 headlamp operates on 2 AA batteries (sold separately); batteries provide 140 hrs. of use on low and 1 hr. 40 min. on turbo.","short_description":"The high-intensity Fenix HL30 headlamp throws a bright beam up to 40m to light up the trail on nighttime adventures.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Camp Lighting","product_group":"Headlamps","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s417131.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l417131.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=417131&tt=df","retail_price":"44.95","sale_price":"32.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=417131\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m417131.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=846395&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8463950001":{"sku":"8463950001","vendor_sku":"HL30R5BZ","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"32.93","sale_price":"32.93"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","camp-lighting","headlamps"]}
