{"sku":"851279","manufacturer_id":"HB-E106","brand_name":"Thomson","product_name":"THOMSON Carbon Road Handlebar - 31.8mm","long_description":"Light, strong and comfortable, the THOMSON Carbon Road handlebar continues the THOMSON tradition of top-notch construction and performance, all with a mild wing shape to offer ergonomic comfort. Mildly flattened wing shape along top of the handlebar provides a comfortable platform for your hands when climbing or otherwise resting palms atop handlebar. Wing section is sized and shaped so that hand movement and rotation aren't negatively affected or \"locked out\", even when rotating bar positioning. Underside of wing section is shaped so that cable housing can be taped securely and unobtrusively without compromising handlebar strength and longevity. Shaping on the bottom side of the wing allows housing to be taped out of the way without the use of narrow housing channels or internal routing, both of which shorten bar life. Center clamping area, which fits 31.8mm stems, is also wide enough for easy installment of clip-on aero bars. Carbon construction uses 3 different fiber types to optimize stiffness and flex for performance and comfort. Reach on the THOMSON Carbon Road handlebar is 78.5mm for all handlebar sizes; drop is relative to size: 40cm = 137mm; 42cm = 140mm; 44cm = 140mm; 46cm = 143mm.","short_description":"Light, strong and comfortable, the THOMSON Carbon Road handlebar continues the THOMSON tradition of top-notch construction and performance, all with a mild wing shape to offer ergonomic comfort.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Components","product_group":"Handlebars And Accessories","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s390415.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l390415.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=390415&tt=df","retail_price":"249.00","sale_price":"249.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=390415\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m390415.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=851279&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8512790001":{"sku":"8512790001","vendor_sku":"HB-E104","upc":"087585000614","size":"40 CM","retail_price":"249.00","sale_price":"249.00"},"8512790002":{"sku":"8512790002","vendor_sku":"HB-E105","upc":"875850006157","size":"42 CM","retail_price":"249.00","sale_price":"249.00"},"8512790003":{"sku":"8512790003","vendor_sku":"HB-E106","upc":"087585000616","size":"44 CM","retail_price":"249.00","sale_price":"249.00"},"8512790004":{"sku":"8512790004","vendor_sku":"HB-E107","upc":"087585000617","size":"46 CM","retail_price":"249.00","sale_price":"249.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-components","handlebars-and-accessories"]}
