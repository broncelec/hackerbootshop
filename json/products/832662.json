{"sku":"832662","manufacturer_id":"REI-DBLB","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":"REI Dog Boots","long_description":"REI dog boots help protect your pup's paws from ice, hot sand, rocks, thorns, broken glass and other rough terrain. Strong, flexible recycled tire-rubber soles and toes offer long wear and great traction on wet or dry surfaces. Boots secure around the legs with adjustable rip-and-stick closures. Durable, 500-denier Cordura(R) nylon uppers flex with each step for comfort. REI dog boots secure around the ankles below your dog's carpal pads; the boots should leave room in the paw area, allowing the paw to spread when bearing weight. Note: keep your dogs nails trimmed to extend the life of the boots.","short_description":"REI dog boots help protect your pup's paws from ice, hot sand, rocks, thorns, broken glass and other rough terrain.","category":"Pets, Toys And Picnicking","subcategory":"Dog Gear","product_group":"Dog Booties","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s267475.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l267475.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=267475&tt=df","keywords":"dog boots,dog shoes,dog booties","retail_price":"50.00","sale_price":"23.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=267475\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m267475.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=832662&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8326620002":{"sku":"8326620002","vendor_sku":"REI-DBMB","upc":"748960982430","size":"M","color":"HYPER BLUE","retail_price":"23.83","sale_price":"23.83"},"8326620003":{"sku":"8326620003","vendor_sku":"REI-DBLB","upc":"748960982331","size":"L","color":"HYPER BLUE","retail_price":"23.83","sale_price":"23.83"}}}
