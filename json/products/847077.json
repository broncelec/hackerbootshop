{"sku":"847077","manufacturer_id":"00.5115.028.040","brand_name":"Avid","product_name":"Avid Shorty Ultimate Cantilever Brake","long_description":"The Avid Shorty Ultimate cantilever brake boasts a host of user-friendly features, including an inline barrel adjuster, cable quick-release and easy setup. CNC-machined arms reduce weight while the open design promotes mud clearance. Height-adjustable, center-mount pads and concentric hardware make for easy setup; front or rear brake can be switched between narrow or wide stances. Brake includes alloy straddle carrier with cable, road-style replaceable cartridge brake pads and an inline barrel adjuster for on-the-fly adjustments. Center-pull design of the Avid Shorty Ultimate cantilever brake is recommended for short-pull mountain or drop bar road levers (not for long-pull, linear-brake levers). Cable quick-release opens the brake up for fast, hassle-free wheel removal or replacement. Please choose between either front or rear brake; not sold as a set.","short_description":"The Avid Shorty Ultimate cantilever brake boasts a host of user-friendly features, including an inline barrel adjuster, cable quick-release and easy setup.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Components","product_group":"Bike Brakes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s388539.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l388539.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=388539&tt=df","retail_price":"109.00","sale_price":"109.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=388539\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m388539.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=847077&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8470770001":{"sku":"8470770001","vendor_sku":"00.5115.028.030","upc":"710845639869","size":"FRONT","retail_price":"109.00","sale_price":"109.00"},"8470770002":{"sku":"8470770002","vendor_sku":"00.5115.028.040","upc":"710845639876","size":"REAR","retail_price":"109.00","sale_price":"109.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-components","bike-brakes"]}
