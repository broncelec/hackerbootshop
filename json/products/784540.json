{"sku":"784540","manufacturer_id":"887XT","brand_name":"Thule","product_name":"Thule SlipStream XT Kayak Rack","long_description":"Great for SUVs or cars with forward mounted racks, the Thule SlipStream XT is a fully adjustable kayak carrier that provides contact-free loading of a kayak onto almost any vehicle. Sliding base adjusts the roller position to prevent the bow of the kayak from coming in contact with the vehicle when loading. Rear felt glide saddles are fully adjustable and allow the kayak to easily slide forward when loading. Saddles in the front are also fully adjustable; rubber pads lock the kayak into position when transporting. Saddles also adjust front to back on base, allowing them to be placed at the strongest sections of the kayak. Includes 2 - 15 ft. straps for securing boat; carries 1 kayak. Includes 1 pair of QuickDraw ratcheting bow/stern tie-down straps. Custom mounting hardware fits square bars, round bars, most aftermarket and factory-installed racks; see Thule Fit Guide. Boat weight should not exceed 75 lbs.","short_description":"Great for SUVs or cars with forward mounted racks, the Thule SlipStream XT is a fully adjustable kayak carrier that provides contact-free loading of a kayak onto almost any vehicle.","category":"Car Racks","subcategory":"Watercraft Racks","product_group":"Kayak Racks","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s383915.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l383915.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=383915&tt=df","retail_price":"349.95","sale_price":"349.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=383915\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m383915.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=784540&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7845400014":{"sku":"7845400014","vendor_sku":"887XT","upc":"091021887985","retail_price":"349.95","sale_price":"349.95"}},"categories":["car-racks","watercraft-racks","kayak-racks"]}
