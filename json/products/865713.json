{"sku":"865713","manufacturer_id":"233972-006","brand_name":"Scott","product_name":"Scott Spark 740 27.5 Bike - 2014","long_description":"Built with a superlight 6061 custom-butted alloy frame and nimble 27.5 in. wheels, the Scott Spark 730 27.5 bike offers an adjustable full-suspension platform for great performance on the trail. The Spark 730 27.5 is quicker and lighter than 29ers, but offers the same benefits of large-diameter wheels-more speed and better traction. Compared to 26 in. wheels, larger-diameter wheels roll over obstacles more easily so you won't stall going uphill over roots and loose soil. Hydroformed and butted 6061 aluminum frame is lightweight and sturdy; geometry has been fine-tuned to maximize suspension performance. Oversize bearings help keep suspension stiff and responsive; rear shock linkage chip lets you adjust head tube angle by 0.5deg to meet your geometry preferences. TwinLoc system provides remote, bar-top control of suspension travel and lockout, letting you customize performance on the fly. 3 TwinLoc settings supply full travel front and rear, Traction mode (full travel on fork with limited rear suspension), and lockout for both front and rear. Fox 32 Float Evolution CTD Air suspension fork has 120mm of air-sprung travel; Fox Float CTD rear shock has a progressive damping curve and excellent sensitivity. Tapered head tube and 15mm front quick-release axle stiffen up the front end for enhanced strength and handling precision. 3x10 Shimano drivetrain features a Shimano XT Shadow Plus rear derailleur along with SLX shifters and front derailleur for quick, efficient and precise performance. Shimano hydraulic disc brakes use a 180mm rotor up front and a 160mm rotor in back to facilitate responsive, progressive braking. Syncros XC37 wheels are outfitted with excellent all-arounder Schwalbe Rocket Ron tires to ensure great traction and fast-rolling performance on the trail. Specs on the Scott Spark 740 27.5 full-suspension mountain bike are subject to change.","short_description":"Built with a superlight 6061 custom-butted alloy frame and nimble 27.5 in. wheels, the Scott Spark 730 27.5 bike offers an adjustable full-suspension platform for great performance on the trail.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bikes","product_group":"Mountain Bikes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s465611.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l465611.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=465611&tt=df","retail_price":"3299.00","sale_price":"3299.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=465611\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m465611.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=865713&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{},"extended_xml_attributes":"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t","categories":["cycling","bikes","mountain-bikes"]}
