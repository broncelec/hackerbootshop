The moisture-wicking, quick-drying shorts have a 4-way stretch fabric. Liners resist pilling and snagging. Women-specific, gel chamois conforms to body contours; a top layer of breathable foam and a bottom layer of thin, resilient foam enhances comfort on the bike. Full coverage chamois features a perforated gel pad to cushion while also breathing; microfiber cover wicks moisture away. Cushy gel pad dissipates shock and reduces skin irritation by forming a fluid barrier between the hard saddle shell and the cyclist. Ultrasoft, breathable chamois is fully elasticized for added flex and stretch. Yoga-inspired 2 in. waistband features crossover stretch fabric in front to enhance comfort while tucked over the bike. Envelope-style pocket on bike shorts stores keys, cash or energy gel. Silicone grippers at leg hems keep shorts from riding up. Skirt outseam length is 13.5 in. (excluding waistband). With a UPF 50+ rating, The Novara Miss Carema gel bike skort provides excellent protection against harmful ultraviolet rays.","short_description":"The Novara Miss Carema gel bike skort keeps you comfortable on the bike with performance features, and they offer plenty of style when you're walking around town.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Cycling Clothing","product_group":"Cycling Skirts","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s447639.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l447639.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=447639&tt=df","retail_price":"59.50","sale_price":"59.50","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=447639\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m447639.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=845371&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8453710001":{"sku":"8453710001","vendor_sku":"15818","upc":"484537100011","size":"S","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"59.50","sale_price":"59.50"},"8453710002":{"sku":"8453710002","vendor_sku":"15818","upc":"484537100028","size":"M","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"59.50","sale_price":"59.50"},"8453710003":{"sku":"8453710003","vendor_sku":"15818","upc":"484537100035","size":"L","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"59.50","sale_price":"59.50"},"8453710004":{"sku":"8453710004","vendor_sku":"15818","upc":"484537100042","size":"XL","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"59.50","sale_price":"59.50"}},"categories":["cycling","cycling-clothing","cycling-skirts"]}
