{"sku":"845486","manufacturer_id":"A2UXG8Y","brand_name":"The North Face","product_name":"The North Face Hightail 2S Sleeping Bag","long_description":"Suited for mild weather and weighing in at only 1 lb. 4 oz. (regular length), the Hightail 2S sleeping bag from The North Face won't slow you down on light and fast adventures into the mountains. With a lower-limit European Norm (EN) rating of 35degF, the Hightail 2S is a great bag for lightweight adventures in mild conditions. Premium 850-fill-power goose down is highly compressible and offers a superior warmth-to-weight ratio. Pertex(R) Endurance(TM) fabric is used on the head, collar and footbox to keep moisture from seeping in. Trapezoidal side baffles are constructed to trap insulation and prevent it from shifting to eliminate cold spots. Footbox allows natural foot movement while also eliminating excess lateral space so you stay warm and comfortable all night long. Fitted hood with drawcords lets you seal in warmth; when it's cold enough to cinch down the hood, the down-insulated draft collar snugs comfortably and holds in warmth. Insulated draft tube backs the zipper to prevent warm air from escaping; anti-snag tape keeps the zipper from catching on the draft tube. Full-length, 2-way zipper lets you make adjustments for ventilation. No more fumbling with the zipper in the middle of the night thanks to the glow-in-the-dark zipper pull. The North Face Hightail 2S sleeping bag comes with a stuff sack and storage bag. European Norm (EN) is an independent third-party temperature rating, allowing accurate comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags.","short_description":"Suited for mild weather and weighing in at only 1 lb. 4 oz.
