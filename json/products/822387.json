{"sku":"822387","manufacturer_id":"R11424085","brand_name":"Ride","product_name":" Ride Sage Boa Snowboard Boots - Women's - 2011/2012","long_description":"Ride Sage Boa snowboard boots let advancing female riders concentrate on what's really important-the Ride! Easy-flexing Sage boots provide high-level performance at a price you gotta love! IN2GRATED(TM) construction shapes the liners to match the interior of the shells, eliminating unnecessary material and weight, and minimizing liner pack out. Boa(R) Coiler lacing system, with ankle and cable guides along entire edge of eyestays, distributes closure force evenly for a dialed-in fit that won't loosen up. The Coiler scoops up loose cable when entering as well as exiting the boot; put your foot in, pull back on the tongue, twist the reel a few times and you're off. Thin, low-profile soles with diecut EVA midsoles enhance comfort and response. Intuition(TM) Plush liners with multi-density foam are body-heat activated over several days' use or immediately custom-formable on in-store pipe heaters. Antimicrobial coating helps control odors; external J-bars increase heel hold. Lock Down speed laces tighten liners quickly and easily for a supportive, nonslip fit. Ride Sage Boa boots are built with a women-specific last to fit typical arch height, forefoot width, and calf, heel and ankle female anatomy. Rip-and-stick boot cuff adjustments allow a personalized fit around the calves for enhanced comfort.","short_description":"Ride Sage Boa snowboard boots let advancing female riders concentrate on what's really important-the Ride!
