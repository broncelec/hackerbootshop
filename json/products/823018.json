{"sku":"823018","manufacturer_id":"VN-0NFN4V0","brand_name":"Vans","product_name":"Vans Encore Boa Snowboard Boots - Women's - 2011/2012","long_description":"The original and best-selling Vans Encore Boa snowboard boots just keep getting better. A soft, forgiving flex and quick and easily adjustable closures make you forget you're even wearing boots. Boa(R) Coiler lacing system, with ankle and cable guides along entire edge of eyestays, distributes closure force evenly for a dialed-in fit that won't loosen up. Boa lacing offers on-the-fly adjustment and never comes untied; you get consistent closure without pressure points. Flexible cuffs provide comfortable and secure closure around ankles and lower legs, and enhance body-to-board responsiveness. Trifit X thermal-formable liners with asymmetric heel-holding inserts feature closed-seam fleece upper cuffs, comfort flex toe boxes and low-volume soles. Open-cell foam interior cushioning layer adds plush comfort. Molded EVA, high-rebound footbeds feature integrated, molded arch supports and breathable airflow perforations; footbeds are treated to fight odors. Center tongue construction and internal web harnesses pad feet and lock them down for controlled riding. Vanslite Snowaffle soles feature a 1-piece, injected-molded EVA midsole/bottom unit with strategically placed rubber in high-wear areas for enhanced board feel and response. Inverted waffle tread pattern's stiffness gradually decreases from heels to toes, maximizing turning response without sacrificing flex and feel at the toes.","short_description":"The original and best-selling Vans Encore Boa snowboard boots just keep getting better.
