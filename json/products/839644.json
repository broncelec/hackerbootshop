{"sku":"839644","manufacturer_id":"BD1121390000125","brand_name":"Black Diamond","product_name":" Black Diamond Distance FL Z-Pole Women's Trekking Poles - Pair","long_description":"The Black Diamond Distance FL Z-Pole trekking poles for women combine a revolutionary folding design with FlickLock Pro adjustability, offering support for backpacking and stream crossings. Innovative folding Z-Pole system offers simple, compact and reliable support with a concealed inner cord, single push-button release and speed cone deployment. Inspired by snow probes, speed cones at the end of each pole section ensure strength, stability and superfast deployment; each speed cone guides a pole section into place. Quick pull on the grip and the first pole section snaps and locks the 3 pole sections into place; flexible tube ends protect the Kevlar(R) center cord when folded. FlickLock Pro is 20% smaller and 30% easier to open than its predecessor and offers twice the holding force. Easily replace and solidly secure pole tips with WaveLock(TM) tip connections. Right- and left-hand-specific straps are light, breathable and moisture-wicking; they feature breathable cut-out windows and easy rip-and-stick adjustability. Light, non-slip EVA foam grips feature foam extensions that allow poles to be held lower on the shaft, a convenience for your short side during hill traverses. Single FlickLock(R) mechanism near the grip of each pole offers 8 in. of adjustable length. Aluminum shafts are superlight and durable. Pole baskets feature shaft catchers to secure pole sections when folded. Black Diamond Distance FL Z-Pole trekking poles come with interchangeable, nonmarking rubber tips, carbide tips and a stow bag. Note: these three-season poles feature fixed baskets.","short_description":"The Black Diamond Distance FL Z-Pole trekking poles for women combine a revolutionary folding design with FlickLock Pro adjustability, offering support for backpacking and stream crossings.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Gadgets","product_group":"Trekking Poles And Hiking Staffs","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s418815.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l418815.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=418815&tt=df","keywords":"collapsible","retail_price":"129.95","sale_price":"129.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=418815\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m418815.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=839644&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8396440001":{"sku":"8396440001","vendor_sku":"BD1121390000110","upc":"793661175360","size":"95 CM-110 CM","color":"PURPLE","retail_price":"129.95","sale_price":"129.95"},"8396440002":{"sku":"8396440002","vendor_sku":"BD1121390000125","upc":"793661175377","size":"105 CM-125 CM","color":"PURPLE","retail_price":"129.95","sale_price":"129.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","gadgets","trekking-poles-and-hiking-staffs"]}
