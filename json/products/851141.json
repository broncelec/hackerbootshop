{"sku":"851141","manufacturer_id":"20-18-01","brand_name":"Switch","product_name":" Switch Lynx Interchangable Polarized Sunglasses - Men's","long_description":"Tired of squinting? The Switch Lynx sunglasses offer glare-reducing polarized lenses and a speedy magnetic lens interchange system so you can be ready for bright sun or partially cloudy days. Polarized lenses reduce 99% of visible glare from water, snow, sand and pavement for increased visual acuity and decreased eye strain. Switch interchangeable system uses high-energy embedded magnets, so lenses jump into place when brought near the frames. Magnets are engineered to stay in place when subjected to the intense jarring of skiing, snowboarding, running or mountain biking. Superior grade nylon frames offer a consistent fit and flexibility in all temperatures and are extremely impact-resistant. Frames include 2 sets of lenses-1 set of polarized lenses for bright light and 1 set of non-polarized, rose-tinted lenses for low light. Crystal black and crystal cool gray frame options come with gray polarized lenses, which provide true color definition on bright days; lens mirror coatings vary between frames. Dark tortoise frame option comes with amber polarized lenses, which enhance contrast on bright, sunny days. Lightweight and virtually shatterproof, polycarbonate lenses are 20 times more impact-resistant than glass and one-third the weight. TriGuard(TM) thin-film lens coating is easy to clean, withstands rough handling and causes water to bead up and run off. Magnetic LensPod(TM) keeps your lenses protected in an easy-to-carry, contoured case and also come with a microfiber cleaning pouch. Switch Lynx polarized sunglasses have a medium to large fit.","short_description":"Tired of squinting?
