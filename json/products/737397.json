{"sku":"737397","manufacturer_id":"7.61E+12","brand_name":"Mammut","product_name":" Mammut Galaxy Duodess Superdry 10mm x 60m Dry Rope","long_description":"An institution unto itself, the Galaxy's reputation for smooth handling, light weight and superb durability is a legend in the making. An all-around performer, rope is well-balanced for use in most applications; ideal for alpine use as well as mountaineering, sport and indoor climbing. Duodess option uses a pattern change to indicate the half-point of the rope. Superdry sheath and core treatment discourages water absorption while resisting dirt and abrasion. This go-anywhere rope enjoys high alpine routes, some sport routes at the crags and occasional glacial ascents. Meets or exceeds UIAA tests for falls, impact force and elongation.","short_description":"An institution unto itself, the Galaxy's reputation for smooth handling, light weight and superb durability is a legend in the making.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Ropes","product_group":"Single Ropes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s179987.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l179987.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=179987&tt=df","keywords":"dynamic","retail_price":"269.95","sale_price":"269.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=179987\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m179987.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=737397&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7373970024":{"sku":"7373970024","vendor_sku":"7.61319E+12","size":"10 Mm X 60 M","color":"GRAY","retail_price":"269.95","sale_price":"269.95"}}}
