{"sku":"828493","manufacturer_id":"13597","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":"REI Joule Sleeping Bag - Women's","long_description":"The waterproof, breathable shell fabric of this 3-season, premium women's REI Joule goose down sleeping bag keeps the downy warmth dry so you sleep like a baby. Tested by an independent third-party lab using European Norm protocol, the EN temperature ratings allow direct comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags. Women-specific bags are cut to match a woman's shape, and provide extra insulation for enhanced warmth. Waterproof, breathable shell is an ultralight, coated ripstop nylon designed to dissipate moisture from the inside and repel moisture from the outside, keeping the down dry. 800-fill-power goose down is efficiently distributed for maximum warmth and compressibility; ultralight polyester mini-ripstop lining has a soft hand-feel. Exclusive REI Down Fill Calculator optimizes the amount of down per baffle for the most warmth with the least amount of down. 60% of insulation is put on top of bag where it contributes the most warmth and loft. In-the-round pattern wraps vertical baffles around perimeter of sleeping bag, from head to foot, creating a 3-dimensional bag that wraps you in warmth. Performance fit saves weight by reducing girth at shoulders, hips and lower legs while increasing thermal efficiency. Baffle spacing is optimized to keep down in place and prevent cold spots. Multi-chambered contour hood, insulated full-face muffler, puffy interior yoke, and full-length zipper draft tube with ground-level seams all work to keep heat in and cold out. Trapezoidal footbox mirrors sleeping position for thermal efficiency and room to move. External chest pocket keeps small essentials-headlamp, watch, glasses-right at hand and easy to find in the dark. Includes nylon stuff sack and large cotton storage bag. Differentiated drawcords (1 round, 1 flat) allow quick identification, even in the dark, so neck and hood adjustments are a cinch.","short_description":"The waterproof, breathable shell fabric of this 3-season, premium women's REI Joule goose down sleeping bag keeps the downy warmth dry so you sleep like a baby.","category":"Camping & Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags","product_group":"Adult Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s218027.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l218027.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=218027&tt=df","keywords":"sleep,bag,cold,sleeping,winter","retail_price":"379.00","sale_price":"279.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=218027\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m218027.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=828493&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8284930001":{"sku":"8284930001","vendor_sku":"13597","upc":"482849300013","size":"Long Right","color":"CAPE PLUM/DARK GRAPE","retail_price":"279.93","sale_price":"279.93"}}}
