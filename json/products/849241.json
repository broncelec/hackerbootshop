{"sku":"849241","manufacturer_id":"EPDT400WR","brand_name":"Shimano","product_name":"Shimano Click'R PD-T400 Bike Pedals","long_description":"Designed for ease-of-use, the Shimano Click'R PD-T400 bike pedals feature an easy-to-engage pedal/cleat interface for riders wanting to try clipless pedals for the first time. At the heart of the Click'R design is a light, easy-to-engage cleat spring that makes it quick and simple to clip in and clip out of the pedals. Reduced effort offers the efficiencies of a clipless system with little fuss-put a foot down fast for unexpected stops or step in casually when you're ready to roll. Plus, the amount of heel twist required to disengage is less than other clipless pedals, so you pop out of the pedals easier and sooner. Because of the easy-to-use design, these also work great for bike touring, commuting, leisure riding or any other riding where you make frequent stops. Pedals feature the convenience of dual-side entry; pop-up cages within the pedals grab cleats for fast, easy engagement. Spring tension can be adjusted to your preference. Integrated reflectors are built into the pedal body platforms for enhanced visibility. SPD cleats are included with the Shimano Click'R PD-T400 bike pedals; please note that the SPD cleats will only work with 2-hole SPD-compatible shoes.","short_description":"Designed for ease-of-use, the Shimano Click'R PD-T400 bike pedals feature an easy-to-engage pedal/cleat interface for riders wanting to try clipless pedals for the first time.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Components","product_group":"Bike Pedals","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s388715.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l388715.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=388715&tt=df","retail_price":"70.00","sale_price":"70.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=388715\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m388715.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=849241&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8492410001":{"sku":"8492410001","vendor_sku":"EPDT400LR","upc":"689228561090","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"70.00","sale_price":"70.00"},"8492410002":{"sku":"8492410002","vendor_sku":"EPDT400WR","upc":"689228561137","color":"WHITE","retail_price":"70.00","sale_price":"70.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-components","bike-pedals"]}
