{"sku":"850350","manufacturer_id":"B16BAA","brand_name":"Petzl","product_name":"Petzl Croll Chest Ascender","long_description":"Use the Petzl Croll chest ascender with a chest strap and a hand ascender for simple and efficient ascension up fixed lines while you're aid climbing, caving and mountaineering. Designed to attach between the seat and chest harness, the Croll has an angled attachment hole to allow it to lie flat against the body. Chrome-plated, spring-loaded steel cam features angled teeth and a self-cleaning slot to securely grip the rope, even in wet, muddy or icy conditions. Upper hole is used to attach a shoulder strap (not included). Safety catch prevents the cam from opening too far, thus helping to keep the rope captured for added safety. Stainless-steel wear plate improves durability by reinforcing the rope friction zone. Ergonomic trigger can be operated with one hand. Petzl Croll chest ascender is designed for use with ropes between 8 and 11mm in diameter.","short_description":"Use the Petzl Croll chest ascender with a chest strap and a hand ascender for simple and efficient ascension up fixed lines while you're aid climbing, caving and mountaineering.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Hardware","product_group":"Ascenders And Descenders","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s380091.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l380091.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=380091&tt=df","keywords":"rappel,belay","retail_price":"68.95","sale_price":"68.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=380091\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m380091.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=850350&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8503500001":{"sku":"8503500001","vendor_sku":"B16BAA","color":"ORANGE","retail_price":"68.95","sale_price":"68.95"}},"categories":["climbing","climbing-hardware","ascenders-and-descenders"]}
