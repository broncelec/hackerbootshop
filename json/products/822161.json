{"sku":"822161","manufacturer_id":"N11972170","brand_name":"Madshus","product_name":" Madshus Cadence 90 MG Cross-Country Skis","long_description":"Step into the light and stable Madshus Cadence 90 MG skis and enjoy snow-covered hills and crisp, cool air as you cruise along groomed trails and make fresh tracks. 68mm tips, 55mm waists and 62mm tails offer a stable platform for confident kicking and gliding; flex is forgiving to make turning fun and simple. Torsion Cap design features a fiberglass wrap that surrounds the entire air-channel wood core, providing a snappy flex that tapers toward the tip and tail. Air-channeled wood core is light, strong and lively. Tips and tails remain soft for easy turning without wash out; soft flex enhances flotation in new snow. Multigrip bases feature scales of varying depths in the kick zones to give you good grip and free glide without the hassle of waxing. Madshus Cadence 90 MG skis are shorter than traditional cross-country skis, making them easier to control and maneuver whether you're on groomed trails or out in your backyard.","short_description":"Step into the light and stable Madshus Cadence 90 MG skis and enjoy snow-covered hills and crisp, cool air as you cruise along groomed trails and make fresh tracks.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Cross-Country Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s381827.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l381827.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=381827&tt=df","retail_price":"139.95","sale_price":"59.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=381827\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m381827.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=822161&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8221610003":{"sku":"8221610003","vendor_sku":"N11972190","upc":"714636916603","size":"190 CM","color":"SILVER","retail_price":"59.93","sale_price":"59.93"}},"categories":["snow","skis","crosscountry-skis"]}
