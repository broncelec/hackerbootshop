{"sku":"829632","manufacturer_id":"L35548500","brand_name":"Salomon","product_name":"Salomon XR Mission Trail-Running Shoes - Women's","long_description":"These Salomon XR Mission trail-running shoes are terrain-tackling, short- to middle-distance training shoes designed for women. Breathable and abrasion-resistant nylon mesh uppers feature asymmetric synthetic leather overlays that wrap and secure insteps for a precise fit. Women-specific last ensures the shoes work with the natural shape of women's feet, enhancing comfort and efficiency. Quicklace(TM) lacing system with friction-free eyelets takes just a single pull for a perfect fit; lace pocket hides lacing away. Protective toe caps guard against bumps and abrasion. Foam insoles enhance comfort. Polyester linings quickly wick moisture away from feet for enhanced comfort. EVA midsoles isolate you from trail impacts, and thermoplastic urethane inserts provide a barrier against sharp rocks underfoot. OS Tendon thermoplastic urethane frames run along the outsoles of the shoes to facilitate better heel-to-toe transitions and push-off efficiency. Contagrip LT(R) and Contragrip HA(R) combination outsoles provide solid traction and tenacious grip. The Salomon XR Mission trail-running shoes have reflective detailing to increase visibility in low light.","short_description":"These Salomon XR Mission trail-running shoes are terrain-tackling, short- to middle-distance training shoes designed for women.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Women's Footwear","product_group":"Women's Shoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s387323.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l387323.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=387323&tt=df","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=387323\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m387323.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=829632&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8296320036":{"sku":"8296320036","vendor_sku":"L35548500","upc":"080694039036","size":"7","color":"IGLOO BLUE/SPECTRUM BLUE","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"8296320038":{"sku":"8296320038","vendor_sku":"L35548500","upc":"080694039050","size":"8","color":"IGLOO BLUE/SPECTRUM BLUE","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"8296320039":{"sku":"8296320039","vendor_sku":"L35548500","upc":"080694039289","size":"8.5","color":"IGLOO BLUE/SPECTRUM BLUE","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"8296320040":{"sku":"8296320040","vendor_sku":"L35548500","upc":"080694568451","size":"9","color":"IGLOO BLUE/SPECTRUM BLUE","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"8296320041":{"sku":"8296320041","vendor_sku":"L35548500","upc":"080694568376","size":"9.5","color":"IGLOO BLUE/SPECTRUM BLUE","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"}},"categories":["footwear","womens-footwear","womens-shoes"]}
