Siliconized on the outside, tough Cordura(R) nylon is weatherproof, lightweight and durable for hiking and backpacking in wet conditions. Polyurethane coating on the inside offers the ultimate in waterproofness; waterproof seams are double-stitched and factory-taped for added weather protection. Hypalon(R) watertight roll-top closure keeps contents secure and protected; fold the Hypalon strip down first and make at least three rolls before closing the buckle. Roll-top fabric sacks are not intended for complete submersion; sensitive electronic devices should be double-bagged or packed in a waterproof hard case for maximum protection.","short_description":"The small Sea to Summit Ultra-Sil pack liner seals the contents of your pack in an ultralight layer of waterproof protection for peace of mind when the weather gets wet.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Backpacks","product_group":"Pack Accessories","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s448395.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l448395.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=448395&tt=df","retail_price":"34.95","sale_price":"34.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=448395\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m448395.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=847671&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8476710001":{"sku":"8476710001","vendor_sku":"288","size":"S","color":"BLUE","retail_price":"34.95","sale_price":"34.95"}}}
