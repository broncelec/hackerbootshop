Use this handy seam sealer on tents, backpacks, mittens, gaiters, foul-weather gear and more, or to repair small rips and holes. All seams must be completely sealed in order for an item to be totally waterproof. Easy to use-simply squeeze lightly and draw tube across the seam; seal seams from the inside whenever possible. Before use, clean surfaces with isopropyl alcohol.
