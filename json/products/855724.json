Line Dart ski poles feature durable aluminium poles that feel lightweight in your hands. Thin, sticky grips won't slip as you charge the terrain park. Tabs on top of grips fit into your hands between your thumb and first finger and make 5-finger grabs a bit more manageable. When conditions change from packed to powder, switch out the smaller, 60mm baskets for larger, 90mm baskets by simply unscrewing the basket off the pole.
