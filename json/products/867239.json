{"sku":"867239","manufacturer_id":"06385","brand_name":"Therm-A-Rest","product_name":" Therm-a-Rest Auriga Down Blanket","long_description":"The Therm-a-Rest Auriga Down Blanket is the ounce counter's dream come true for warm-weather backpacking. It packs generous warmth with 750-fill down while full-length draft tubes keep out cool air. Eliminating the zipper, the open blanket design saves weight; perimeter snaps offer multiple integration options around a sleeping pad. Nylon shell features 750-fill-power goose down insulation for warmth down to about 35degF; baffle construction keeps down from shifting around, so cold spots are prevented. Down insulation delivers an unsurpassed warmth-to-weight ratio; it's one of the lightest, warmest and most compressible insulations available. Ultralight 20-denier fabric helps keep the weight at an absolute minimum in warm weather. Full-length draft tubes keep out cool air. Down blanket works with a rectangular sleeping pad (sold separately) allowing ventilation for warm-weather outings. Therm-a-Rest Auriga Down Blanket includes a small stuff sack and storage sack.","short_description":"The Therm-a-Rest Auriga Down Blanket is the ounce counter's dream come true for warm-weather backpacking.
