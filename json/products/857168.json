{"sku":"857168","manufacturer_id":"1330825","brand_name":"Union","product_name":"Union Flite Pro Snowboard Bindings - 2013/2014","long_description":"Union Flite Pro bindings bring next-level performance to your days on the hill. Lightweight, comfortable and supportive, these bindings offer a forgiving flex, and are a freestyle rider's dream. Flite bases are super lightweight with a low-profile, freestyle-oriented design; they're made with high-quality DuPont(TM) Zytel(R) ST nylon. Baseplates are designed to be supremely strong with the smallest footprint possible; this promotes free, even board flex for sweet response, board control and durability. Injected, dual-density EVA bushings damp vibrations underfoot, promoting a comfortable ride and smooth, even board flex with no dead spots. Extruded aluminum heel cups undergo an anodizing process that further increases their strength by 30%; they'll maintain their shape no matter how much wear and tear they see. Flite Pro highbacks balance the need for freedom in the air with the strategic support needed to set down the landing gear. 3D Direct-Connect ankle straps eliminate elasticity and evenly distribute pressure across feet and ankles for increased comfort and board control. Multi-position toe straps offer an improved and updated fit for a wide range of boots; aluminum buckles. Union Flite Pro bindings are compatible with Burton The Channel M6 snowboards.","short_description":"Union Flite Pro bindings bring next-level performance to your days on the hill.
