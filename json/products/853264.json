Synthetic leather and nylon mesh uppers are breathable and durable; low-cut ankle support reduces overall weight. 3 rip-and-stick closure straps are angled to follow a more anatomic curve, ensuring an evenly tensioned fit and the elimination of hot spots. Nylon and composite fiber shank/plates ensure excellent power transfer. Insoles provide excellent arch support and cushion. Low-profile, concave shaping of footbed/plate cradles the foot for support, comfort and pedaling efficiency. Low-profile outsoles can be worn indoors and out.
