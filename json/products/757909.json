Siliconized Cordura(R) nylon cover keeps your pack and, therefore, your clothes, sleeping bag and gear protected from the elements. Siliconized nylon is highly rip and tear resistant; the fibers stretch under pressure instead of locking together and tearing. Seamless construction for weather-tight protection. Siliconized nylon mini stuff sack attaches to packcover so it won't get lost. Mid-back keeper strap helps secure cover to the pack and keep the sides from catching wind.","short_description":"This ultra-lightweight packcover is lighter than a multi-tool and far more practical in a downpour!","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Backpacks","product_group":"Pack Accessories","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s412023.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l412023.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=412023&tt=df","retail_price":"41.95","sale_price":"41.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=412023\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m412023.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=757909&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7579090002":{"sku":"7579090002","vendor_sku":"204","color":"LIME","retail_price":"41.95","sale_price":"41.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","backpacks","pack-accessories"]}
