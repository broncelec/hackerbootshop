Flexible forefoot and a nylon plate deliver pedaling stability and easy movement; shoes absorb shock, return energy and provide cushioning on and off bike. Uppers feature quick-drying, breathable mesh and synthetic leather. Just like your comfortable tennis shoes, the lace closure system and low-cut construction provide a light and fast fit. Outsoles feature running-shoe style rubber lugs to offer sure traction and durability when walking around off of the bike. The Pearl Izumi X-Road Fuel II bike shoes are compatible with 2-bolt cleats; please note that cleats are not included (cleats typically come with pedals).","short_description":"Keeping pace with you from spin class to the open roads, the Pearl Izumi X-Road Fuel II bike shoes combine on-bike performance with the good looks of a running shoe.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Cycling Shoes","product_group":"Casual Cycling Shoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s380279.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l380279.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=380279&tt=df","retail_price":"105.00","sale_price":"105.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=380279\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m380279.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=846823&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8468230001":{"sku":"8468230001","vendor_sku":"1521300422336.0","upc":"703051949792","size":"36","color":"WHITE/SILVER","retail_price":"105.00","sale_price":"105.00"},"8468230002":{"sku":"8468230002","vendor_sku":"1521300422337.0","upc":"703051949808","size":"37","color":"WHITE/SILVER","retail_price":"105.00","sale_price":"105.00"},"8468230003":{"sku":"8468230003","vendor_sku":"1521300422338.0","upc":"703051949815","size":"38","color":"WHITE/SILVER","retail_price":"105.00","sale_price":"105.00"},"8468230005":{"sku":"8468230005","vendor_sku":"1521300422340.0","upc":"703051949839","size":"40","color":"WHITE/SILVER","retail_price":"105.00","sale_price":"105.00"},"8468230008":{"sku":"8468230008","vendor_sku":"1521300422343.0","upc":"703051949860","size":"43","color":"WHITE/SILVER","retail_price":"105.00","sale_price":"105.00"}},"categories":["cycling","cycling-shoes","casual-cycling-shoes"]}
