Stretchy neoprene forms to your body for a flexible, comfortable fit. 2mm neoprene on chest panels offers solid insulation, and 1mm neoprene throughout rest of wetsuit enhances flexibility. Paneling and flatlock seams are placed to work with a paddler's movements, reducing overall wear and chafing. Fully adjustable, watertight collar helps keep the chill out. Interlocking back zipper with offset teeth prevents water from seeping through. Hand wash the women's O'Neill Bahia Spring wetsuit in cold water, drip dry out of sun and store in a cool, dry place.","short_description":"Designed by women for women, the O'Neill Bahia Spring wetsuit offers an extra line of defense against that fun-dampening chill on the water.","category":"Paddling","subcategory":"Paddling Clothing","product_group":"Wetsuits","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s431751.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l431751.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=431751&tt=df","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=431751\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m431751.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=868678&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8686780001":{"sku":"8686780001","vendor_sku":"4281-X01","upc":"603731983903","size":"4","color":"BLACK/LIGHT AQUA/SPYGLASS","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"},"8686780002":{"sku":"8686780002","vendor_sku":"4281-X01","upc":"603731983958","size":"6","color":"BLACK/LIGHT AQUA/SPYGLASS","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"},"8686780004":{"sku":"8686780004","vendor_sku":"4281-X01","upc":"603731983750","size":"10","color":"BLACK/LIGHT AQUA/SPYGLASS","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"},"8686780005":{"sku":"8686780005","vendor_sku":"4281-X01","upc":"603731983804","size":"12","color":"BLACK/LIGHT AQUA/SPYGLASS","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"}},"categories":["paddling","paddling-clothing","wetsuits"]}
