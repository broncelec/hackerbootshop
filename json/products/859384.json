{"sku":"859384","manufacturer_id":"RRC02JY","brand_name":"Rossignol","product_name":"Rossignol Scan JR Skis with Bindings - Juniors' - 2013/2014","long_description":"For first-timers or rising intermediates weighing more than 45 lbs., the juniors' Rossignol Scan JR skis with bindings inspire confidence with their rockered tips and lightweight construction. Stable and forgiving, Rossignol Scan JR skis with bindings encourage skill progression; they're ideal for groomed trails at low to medium speeds. Rockered tips are easy to maneuver and make linking turns easy and fun. Cap construction keeps skis light and fun and boosts durability. Forgiving microcell-foam core won't punish a developing skier for small mistakes, yet it's responsive enough to encourage skill progression. Comp Kid 45 bindings feature lightweight composite materials that ease turn transitions and make carrying skis a breeze. Design makes it easy to step into and exit the bindings, so kids can get in and out of their skis quickly. Catering to lightweight skiers, DIN range of 0.75 - 4.5 allows bindings to release boots easily in the event of a tumble. Recommended skier weight ranges from 45 to 79 lbs. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.","short_description":"For first-timers or rising intermediates weighing more than 45 lbs., the juniors' Rossignol Scan JR skis with bindings inspire confidence with their rockered tips and lightweight construction.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s439823.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l439823.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=439823&tt=df","keywords":"jstp7615","retail_price":"209.95","sale_price":"209.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=439823\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m439823.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859384&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8593840001":{"sku":"8593840001","vendor_sku":"RRC02JY","size":"100 CM","retail_price":"209.95","sale_price":"209.95"},"8593840002":{"sku":"8593840002","vendor_sku":"RRC02JY","size":"110 CM","retail_price":"209.95","sale_price":"209.95"},"8593840003":{"sku":"8593840003","vendor_sku":"RRC02JY","size":"120 CM","retail_price":"209.95","sale_price":"209.95"},"8593840004":{"sku":"8593840004","vendor_sku":"RRC02JY","size":"130 CM","retail_price":"209.95","sale_price":"209.95"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
