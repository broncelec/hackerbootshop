You can do the repair in the field using only a screwdriver. 2-pin side-release buckles are a direct replacement for nonadjustable buckles such as those commonly found on dry bag closures and V-pull style waist belts. Stainless steel pins hold the buckle together permanently; a Phillips head screwdriver securely attaches the buckle to the webbing on your pack's strap. Since the buckle is permanent, there's no need to have your new buckle sewn on when you're back home. Sea to Summit 2-Pin Side-Release Field Repair Buckle is available in 2 widths: 3/4 in. and 1 in.","short_description":"The Sea to Summit 2-Pin Side-Release Field Repair Buckle replaces nonadjustable buckles like those found on dry bags or V-pull waist belts.
