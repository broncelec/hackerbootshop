Flexible food-grade silicone walls collapse, slimming the bowl down to a slender 0.5 in. thick and minimizing the space it takes up in a pack. Flexible walls let you accurately pour liquid from the bowl into another container. Rigid food-grade nylon base is tough enough to double as a cutting board while prepping meals. Walls and base withstand temperatures up to 300degF. Sea to Summit XL bowl is dishwasher safe.","short_description":"The Sea to Summit XL bowl is 77% larger than the popular X bowl and can be used as both a bowl and plate to meet all your dining needs while camping.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Camp Kitchen","product_group":"Cookware And Dinnerware","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s414955.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l414955.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=414955&tt=df","retail_price":"17.95","sale_price":"17.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=414955\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m414955.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=851914&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8519140002":{"sku":"8519140002","vendor_sku":"109","color":"LIME","retail_price":"17.95","sale_price":"17.95"},"8519140004":{"sku":"8519140004","vendor_sku":"109-20","color":"RED","retail_price":"17.95","sale_price":"17.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","camp-kitchen","cookware-and-dinnerware"]}
