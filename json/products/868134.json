{"sku":"868134","manufacturer_id":"7020469","brand_name":"Easton","product_name":"Easton EA90 SL Road Wheel - Rear","long_description":"With an improved Echo hub for smoothness and durability, the Easton EA90 SL Rear Road Wheel is a sturdy platform for serious road riding and features tubeless compatability. UST tubeless compatibility offers the benefits of tubeless (lighter weight, lower tire pressure and fewer flats), with the option of using a traditional tube/tire setup. Every aspect of the Echo hub is designed to improve bearing life, increase stiffness and cut weight, and the extra width of the hub vastly increases durability. Featuring a 17.5mm internal rim width, the extra wide alloy rim creates more surface area for traction when leaning into corners. 24 double-butted straight-pull Sapim spokes increase durability. The Easton EA90 SL Rear Road Wheel is completely hand-built; spoke tension is acoustically tuned to provide the best possible ride right out of the box.","short_description":"With an improved Echo hub for smoothness and durability, the Easton EA90 SL Rear Road Wheel is a sturdy platform for serious road riding and features tubeless compatability.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Components","product_group":"Bike Tires, Tubes And Wheels","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s389763.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l389763.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=389763&tt=df","retail_price":"510.00","sale_price":"510.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=389763\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m389763.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=868134&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8681340001":{"sku":"8681340001","vendor_sku":"7020469","upc":"768686935206","size":"700C","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"510.00","sale_price":"510.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-components","bike-tires-tubes-and-wheels"]}
