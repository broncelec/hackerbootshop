{"sku":"859339","manufacturer_id":"S130304301159","brand_name":"K2","product_name":"K2 MissConduct Skis - Women's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Taking you from groomers to soft snow to snappy performance in the half-pipe, the women's K2 MissConduct skis offer a versatile, go-anywhere 85mm waist and a lightweight core for jumps and jibbing. K2 women's skis reduce the bulk and weight of all components to create very lightweight skis suited to the specific needs of female skiers. With a smooth flex for tail presses and tricks in the park, the Bioflex2 core combines aspen, paulownia and bamboo woods to deliver light weight and responsive performance. A fiberglass weave around the wood core provides torsional stiffness for highly responsive turning. Rockered tips initiate turns easily and offer agile performance on all kinds of terrain, and slight camber underfoot offers tenacious edge hold on firm snow. Modified sidewall construction increases durability for tricks in the park and transfers power directly to the edges of the ski to enhance turning. Tip and tail rivets help skis withstand hard landings and big impacts in the park. Base or topsheet color on the women's K2 MissConduct skis may vary from online photo.","short_description":"Taking you from groomers to soft snow to snappy performance in the half-pipe, the women's K2 MissConduct skis offer a versatile, go-anywhere 85mm waist and a lightweight core for jumps and jibbing.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382071.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382071.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382071&tt=df","retail_price":"399.95","sale_price":"239.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382071\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382071.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859339&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8593390001":{"sku":"8593390001","vendor_sku":"S130304301149","upc":"886745165194","size":"149 CM","retail_price":"239.93","sale_price":"239.93"},"8593390002":{"sku":"8593390002","vendor_sku":"S130304301159","upc":"886745165217","size":"159 CM","retail_price":"239.93","sale_price":"239.93"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
