{"sku":"753411","manufacturer_id":"8004037","brand_name":"Yakima","product_name":"Yakima Mako Kayak Saddles - Pair","long_description":"Yakima Mako kayak saddles are custom-designed with form-fitting cradles to fit all popular boat chine shapes. Mako Saddles fit directly onto round and square crossbars; fits most factory racks-just add Yakima MightyMounts (sold separately). Pad is recessed so that boats slide easily over the saddle when loaded. When strap is tightened, raised pads of soft Dynaflex material securely grip the boat hull. Strap design features a quick-release anchor, allowing strap to be easily removed when not in use. Soft pad around the Ancra(TM) buckle protects the vehicle and boat from scratches. Stainless-steel hardware lasts as long as a love for the water. Comes with one set of bow/stern tie-downs with adjustable strap and heavy duty hooks. Sold as a pair with strap included; customize with another pair of Mako saddles, Mako Aero Saddles or a pair of HullyRollers (sold separately).","short_description":"Yakima Mako kayak saddles are custom-designed with form-fitting cradles to fit all popular boat chine shapes.","category":"Car Racks","subcategory":"Watercraft Racks","product_group":"Kayak Racks","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s383895.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l383895.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=383895&tt=df","retail_price":"89.00","sale_price":"89.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=383895\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m383895.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=753411&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7534110015":{"sku":"7534110015","vendor_sku":"8004037","upc":"736745040376","size":"PAIR","retail_price":"89.00","sale_price":"89.00"}},"categories":["car-racks","watercraft-racks","kayak-racks"]}
