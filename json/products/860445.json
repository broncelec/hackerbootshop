{"sku":"860445","manufacturer_id":"GM74515","brand_name":"Gregory","product_name":" Gregory Miwok 18 Pack","long_description":"The updated Gregory Miwok 18 pack features a sculpted design that reduces seams, increases durability and creates a cleaner overall aesthetic for your done-in-a day trail fun. Inspired by the bio-dynamics of the human body, the shoulder and waistbelt suspension attach with BioSync(TM) artificial tendons for added stability. These artificial tendons act as attachment points allowing harness to stretch into an ideal fit, moving with the body while in motion. Back panel, shoulder straps and hipbelt feature air-mesh to vent and wick away moisture; die-cut foam on the harness and back panel adds breathability and decreases weight. Internal compression system allows you to keep pack compressed and snug against your back; you can reach the compression straps easily while the pack is on. Compared to the prior version of the pack, the Miwok 18 features improved access to the external hydration pocket with a rip-and-stick closure. Drink tube routing also includes an enhanced keeper clip on the shoulder harness (reservoir sold separately). Expandable, stretch-mesh front mesh pocket with 3-point compression lets you stash bulky gear and keep it easily accessible. Zippered top pocket provides storage for often-used essentials; front harness includes a convenient sunglasses holder; front harness includes a convenient sunglasses holder.

The Gregory Miwok 18 pack is constructed from 70-denier ultra-tear-strength coated nylon for water repellency and durability.","short_description":"The updated Gregory Miwok 18 pack features a sculpted design that reduces seams, increases durability and creates a cleaner overall aesthetic for your done-in-a day trail fun.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Backpacks","product_group":"Day Packs","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s411295.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l411295.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=411295&tt=df","retail_price":"99.00","sale_price":"99.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=411295\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m411295.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=860445&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8604450001":{"sku":"8604450001","vendor_sku":"GM74515","upc":"844930080479","color":"STORM BLACK","retail_price":"99.00","sale_price":"99.00"},"8604450002":{"sku":"8604450002","vendor_sku":"GM74514","upc":"844930080462","color":"MISTRAL BLUE","retail_price":"99.00","sale_price":"99.00"},"8604450003":{"sku":"8604450003","vendor_sku":"GM74516","upc":"844930080486","color":"TROPIC ORANGE","retail_price":"99.00","sale_price":"99.00"}}}
