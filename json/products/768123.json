{"sku":"768123","manufacturer_id":"07030","brand_name":"Platypus","product_name":" Platypus plusBottle 1-Liter Water Bottle with Push/Pull Cap","long_description":"Now more durable and flexible than ever, the taste-free Platypus plusBottle(TM) water bottle with push/pull cap is an excellent option for bringing water on your backcountry adventures. Features a new shape that's even easier to hold and drink from than earlier versions; carry/hang loop adds convenience. Incredibly durable triple-layer laminate, welded construction lasts trip after trip. Food-grade polyethylene lining ensures bottle won't retain flavors or taste like plastic. All-natural, silver-ion-based SlimeGuard(TM) antimicrobial keeps the taste-free film clear of bacteria. 80% lighter than standard hard-plastic bottles, it takes five 1-liter Platypus bottles to equal the weight of one 1-liter hard-plastic bottle. Compact and flexible design can be flattened when empty and rolled up to fit practically anywhere in your pack. Tough enough to handle temperatures from freezing to boiling; bottle stands upright when full. Push/pull cap allows quick and easy drinking. Add Platypus accessories such as a taste-free drink tube or screw-on cap (both sold separately) to increase the bottle's versatility.","short_description":"Now more durable and flexible than ever, the taste-free Platypus plusBottle(TM) water bottle with push/pull cap is an excellent option for bringing water on your backcountry adventures.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Water Bottles And Treatment","product_group":"Water Bottles, Flasks And Jugs","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s425451.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l425451.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=425451&tt=df","retail_price":"16.95","sale_price":"16.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=425451\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m425451.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=768123&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7681230012":{"sku":"7681230012","vendor_sku":"07030","upc":"040818070307","retail_price":"16.95","sale_price":"16.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","water-bottles-and-treatment","water-bottles-flasks-and-jugs"]}
