{"sku":"860819","manufacturer_id":"AE5009700245","brand_name":"Atomic","product_name":" Atomic Waymaker 80 W Ski Boots - Women's 2013/2014","long_description":"Built with hike/ski levers, the intermediate-level Atomic Waymaker 80 W ski boots for women feature roomy 101mm footbeds and flexible shell zones for comfort while you explore the sidecountry. Hike/ski levers release cuffs from lower shells to increase range of motion when hiking; return levers to ski position to lock down cuffs during the descent. Single-component shell moves as a single piece to maximize power transfer and ensure high performance, and pliable plastic flex zones adapt instantly to the shape of foot. Located between the first buckle and the toe, flexible shell zones made of soft plastic improve balance, circulation, warmth and sensitivity. Each boot liner features differing materials on the left and right; firm material helps you feel the terrain on the inside of the turn and soft material cushions recovery. Women-specific liners feature cushioning insoles and very warm faux fur to enhance comfort. Custom-moldable liners mold to ankles and forefeet to increase heel hold. Medium flex index of 80 offers the responsiveness preferred by progressing intermediate skiers. The Atomic Waymaker Carbon 100 W ski boots for women feature 101mm footbeds to provide a comfortable fit.","short_description":"Built with hike/ski levers, the intermediate-level Atomic Waymaker 80 W ski boots for women feature roomy 101mm footbeds and flexible shell zones for comfort while you explore the sidecountry.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Downhill Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382679.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382679.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382679&tt=df","retail_price":"399.00","sale_price":"319.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382679\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382679.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=860819&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8608190004":{"sku":"8608190004","vendor_sku":"AE5009700265","upc":"887445008378","size":"Mondo 26.5","color":"BLUE","retail_price":"319.93","sale_price":"319.93"}},"categories":["snow","ski-boots","downhill-ski-boots"]}
