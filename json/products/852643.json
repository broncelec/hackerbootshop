Geared for touring, the Andel triple crankset and Shimano 9-speed cassette offer 27 wide-ranging gears for easy spins over passes and fast cruising along the countryside. Shimano bar-end shifters provide easy, reliable shifting; with a minimum of complicated parts, bar-end shifters are low-maintenance compared to integrated shifter/brake levers. Tektro cantilever brakes provide confident braking and offer plenty of clearance for fenders (fenders sold separately). Stout 36-hole Alex Adventurer rims, Shimano LX hubs and Continental Contact tires (in either 26 in. or 700c sizes) combine to supply smooth, sturdy rolling. Frame features eyelets for fenders and racks (sold separately), 3 water bottle mounts, a pump peg, chainstay spoke holder and downtube lever bosses. Please note: smaller sizes (50, 52, 54cm) have 26 in. wheels to help optimize fit and versatility for smaller riders; sizes 56cm and larger have 700c wheels for taller riders. Specs are subject to change.","short_description":"Designed and built to handle long rides, the sturdy and versatile Surly Long Haul Trucker bike is ready to roll on your touring adventures, and also works great as a commuter or everyday ride.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bikes","product_group":"Road Bikes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s374543.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l374543.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=374543&tt=df","retail_price":"1300.00","sale_price":"1300.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=374543\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m374543.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=852643&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8526430005":{"sku":"8526430005","vendor_sku":"BK3852I","upc":"708752079021","size":"52 CM X 26 IN","color":"SMOG-GERRFIC SILVER","retail_price":"1300.00","sale_price":"1300.00"},"8526430006":{"sku":"8526430006","vendor_sku":"BK3854I","upc":"708752079038","size":"54 CM X 26 IN","color":"SMOG-GERRFIC SILVER","retail_price":"1300.00","sale_price":"1300.00"},"8526430011":{"sku":"8526430011","vendor_sku":"BK3956I","upc":"708752079090","size":"56 CM X 700 C","color":"SMOG-GERRFIC SILVER","retail_price":"1300.00","sale_price":"1300.00"},"8526430012":{"sku":"8526430012","vendor_sku":"BK3958I","upc":"708752079106","size":"58 CM X 700 C","color":"SMOG-GERRFIC SILVER","retail_price":"1300.00","sale_price":"1300.00"},"8526430013":{"sku":"8526430013","vendor_sku":"BK3960I","upc":"708752079113","size":"60 CM X 700 C","color":"SMOG-GERRFIC SILVER","retail_price":"1300.00","sale_price":"1300.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bikes","road-bikes"]}
