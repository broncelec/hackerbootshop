PAS 22 personal anchor system has been redesigned to be stronger and lighter than the original Metolius PAS. Girth hitch the system to your harness, then simply clip into an anchor at any of the full-strength sewn loops. Strong 11mm Dyneema Monster Sling webbing keeps weight and bulk down; each loop is rated to 22kN. Contrasting color on the end loop makes it easy to identify your clip-in point. Metolius PAS 22 personal anchor system can also be used to easily build an equalized top rope anchor on a climb with bolted anchors.","short_description":"The Metolius PAS 22(TM) personal anchor system makes it easy to connect to an anchor whether you're cleaning gear on a top rope climb or getting ready to belay a second up a multipitch route.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Protection","product_group":"Anchor Systems","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s407079.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l407079.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=407079&tt=df","retail_price":"32.95","sale_price":"32.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=407079\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m407079.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=825820&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8258200001":{"sku":"8258200001","vendor_sku":"PASS007","upc":"602150461962","color":"MULTI","retail_price":"32.95","sale_price":"32.95"}},"categories":["climbing","climbing-protection","anchor-systems"]}
