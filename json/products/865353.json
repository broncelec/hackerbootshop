With 3.25 in. of thickness, you'll be so comfortable you may want to bring along an alarm clock. PrimaLoft(TM) Synergy synthetic insulation makes this 3-season pad a smart choice for added comfort and warmth on backpacking trips to high elevations. R-value equals 4.1; most sleeping pads we sell range in R-value from 1.0 (minimally insulated) to 9.5 (well insulated). I-beam construction eliminates welded seams to reduce cold spots and ensures quick inflation/deflation, consistent airflow and stability. Durable, lightweight diamond ripstop nylon fabric on the top and bottom withstands regular use in the outdoors. 3.25 in. thick pad is waterproof and lightweight; pad packs down to be just a bit larger than a standard Nalgene bottle. The Big Agnes Air Core insulated sleeping pad includes a stuff sack and repair kit; repair kit is in a small pocket on the inside of the stuff sack.","short_description":"The Big Agnes Air Core Insulated Mummy Sleeping Pad is so lightweight you'll never tire of carrying it.
