{"sku":"714249","manufacturer_id":"L10C03","brand_name":"Lodge","product_name":" Lodge Logic Dutch Oven - 4 Qt.","long_description":"The heirloom black patina on this 4 qt. Lodge Logic Deep Dutch oven eliminates the time and effort of seasoning-it's ready to use right out of the box! Lodge coats the entire surface of the oven with a proprietary vegetable oil formula, then bakes the oil onto the utensil in a hot industrial oven. The high temperature allows the oil to penetrate deeply into the cast iron surface, creating that prized heirloom finish. Cast iron pot distributes heat evenly-perfect for both quick, high-heat browning and long, slow cooking. 10-in. diameter oven and lid have handles for convenience. Snug, flanged lid makes a self-basting cover that keeps in heat. The Lodge Logic Deep Dutch oven is ideal for stews or meats.","short_description":"The heirloom black patina on this 4 qt.
