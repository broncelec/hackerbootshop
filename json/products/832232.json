{"sku":"832232","manufacturer_id":"87501/202","brand_name":"Scarpa","product_name":"Scarpa Mont Blanc GTX Mountaineering Boots - Women's","long_description":"With superb all-around mountain performance, the Scarpa Mont Blanc GTX women's mountaineering boots are lightweight and responsive for great feel yet sturdy and tough enough for harsh environs. Single-piece 3mm suede leather uppers remain resilient in demanding conditions; HS12 tanning treatment adds water resistance and speeds dry time. Boot design faciliates dynamic flex and natural movement in uppers while maintaining a solid, stable platform underfoot; close-to-toe lacing provides a snug, responsive fit. GORE-TEX(R) waterproof liners let feet breathe while protecting them from the elements, keeping them dry and comfortable. Moisture-wicking nylon linings absorb and disperse sweat to keep feet and boots dry and comfortable. Insulated Comfort polyester fibers and Pro-Fiber insoles create a barrier between your feet and the cold ground and air, helping to keep your feet warm. Rubber rands protect uppers against bumps and abrasion while rear heel slings lock heels in for secure performance. Sturdy polyurethane midsoles absorb shock without compromising sensitivity; thermoplastic urethane inserts create front bale for crampons. Vibram(R) rubber outsoles on the Scarpa Mont Blanc mountaineering boots ensure superb trail traction.","short_description":"With superb all-around mountain performance, the Scarpa Mont Blanc GTX women's mountaineering boots are lightweight and responsive for great feel yet sturdy and tough enough for harsh environs.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Women's Footwear","product_group":"Women's Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s386719.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l386719.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=386719&tt=df","retail_price":"469.00","sale_price":"469.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=386719\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m386719.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=832232&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8322320001":{"sku":"8322320001","vendor_sku":"87501/202","upc":"666898227204","size":"37","color":"KIWI","retail_price":"469.00","sale_price":"469.00"},"8322320003":{"sku":"8322320003","vendor_sku":"87501/202","upc":"666898227228","size":"38","color":"KIWI","retail_price":"469.00","sale_price":"469.00"},"8322320006":{"sku":"8322320006","vendor_sku":"87501/202","upc":"666898227259","size":"39.5","color":"KIWI","retail_price":"469.00","sale_price":"469.00"},"8322320009":{"sku":"8322320009","vendor_sku":"87501/202","upc":"666898227280","size":"41","color":"KIWI","retail_price":"469.00","sale_price":"469.00"}},"categories":["footwear","womens-footwear","womens-boots"]}
