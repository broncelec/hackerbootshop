{"sku":"863021","manufacturer_id":"9905","brand_name":"Cycleops","product_name":"CycleOps Fluid2 Bike Trainer with Training Kit - 2014","long_description":"With resistance suited to advanced cyclists and a bundle of extras to maximize indoor training, the CycleOps Fluid2 bike trainer with training kit offers quiet operation and a smooth, roadlike feel. No manual adjustments needed; simply shift gears as you would when riding outside to increase or decrease the resistance, and the faster you pedal the harder it gets. Spin along with virtually no resistance or hammer out a 2000-watt sprint-you will never outgrow this trainer no matter what training you require. With a quick load cam lever, you simply adjust the resistance once and then lock it into place so there is no guessing each time you put your bike on the trainer. Combine this with a smooth, quiet ride, locking bolt ring and heavy-duty steel construction, and you're ready to sprint, spin and climb with confidence. Cooling mechanism on the Fluid2 trainer's resistance unit helps improve longevity and optimal resistance performance. The Cyclops Fluid2 bike trainer features adjustable foot pads, a quick release handle, self-cooling mechanism and folding legs for storage. Updated frame works with all standard wheels and now works with 29er mountain bike wheels (fits most treads to 2.25 in.). Included training mat protects your floor from sweat and bike grime; also helps stabilize the trainer so it will not wander when you're really pedaling fast. Included cloth bike thong stretches between your handlebar and seat to catch dripping sweat, keeping it off of your bike below and helping prevent corrosion.","short_description":"With resistance suited to advanced cyclists and a bundle of extras to maximize indoor training, the CycleOps Fluid2 bike trainer with training kit offers quiet operation and a smooth, roadlike feel.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Accessories","product_group":"Bike Trainers","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s379615.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l379615.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=379615&tt=df","retail_price":"405.00","sale_price":"405.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=379615\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m379615.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=863021&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8630210001":{"sku":"8630210001","vendor_sku":"9905","upc":"012527009725","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"405.00","sale_price":"405.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-accessories","bike-trainers"]}
