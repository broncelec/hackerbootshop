{"sku":"862184","manufacturer_id":"CF22385401","brand_name":"Cannondale","product_name":" Cannondale Synapse Alloy 6 Compact Women's Bike - 2014","long_description":"Designed for speed, comfort and value, the Cannondale Synapse Alloy 6 Compact women's road bike combines Shimano Tiagra parts and a comfort-enhancing frame for long-distance rides. Synapse frame is built to give riders enhanced handling, stability and steering precision in a more comfortable, upright position than race-oriented frames. Plus, the women-specific frame is designed to enhance the performance and comfort of women cyclists. The rear part of the frame and the carbon-bladed fork feature the Cannondale Synapse Active Vibration Elimination (S.A.V.E.) technology for damping road vibration. BB30 bottom bracket enhances stiffness for more efficient power transfer. Shimano Tiagra components offer dependable shifts through the 20 gears. FSA Omega compact crankset and a wide-ranging 12-30 tooth cassette deliver a wide range of gears for easy spinning no matter the gradient. Schwalbe Lugano tires supply low rolling-resistance and grippy handling. Specs on the Cannondale Synapse Alloy 6 Compact women's road bike are subject to change; pedals sold separately.","short_description":"Designed for speed, comfort and value, the Cannondale Synapse Alloy 6 Compact women's road bike combines Shimano Tiagra parts and a comfort-enhancing frame for long-distance rides.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bikes","product_group":"Road Bikes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s374683.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l374683.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=374683&tt=df","retail_price":"1159.00","sale_price":"1159.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=374683\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m374683.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=862184&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8621840001":{"sku":"8621840001","vendor_sku":"CF22384401","upc":"884603522608","size":"44 CM","color":"MAGNESIUM WHITE/JADE","retail_price":"1159.00","sale_price":"1159.00"},"8621840002":{"sku":"8621840002","vendor_sku":"CF22384801","upc":"884603522615","size":"48 CM","color":"MAGNESIUM WHITE/JADE","retail_price":"1159.00","sale_price":"1159.00"},"8621840003":{"sku":"8621840003","vendor_sku":"CF22385101","upc":"884603522622","size":"51 CM","color":"MAGNESIUM WHITE/JADE","retail_price":"1159.00","sale_price":"1159.00"},"8621840004":{"sku":"8621840004","vendor_sku":"CF22385401","upc":"884603522639","size":"54 CM","color":"MAGNESIUM WHITE/JADE","retail_price":"1159.00","sale_price":"1159.00"},"8621840005":{"sku":"8621840005","vendor_sku":"CF22385601","upc":"884603522646","size":"56 CM","color":"MAGNESIUM WHITE/JADE","retail_price":"1159.00","sale_price":"1159.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bikes","road-bikes"]}
