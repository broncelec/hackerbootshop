The synthetic Siesta bag brings the creature comforts of home to the campsite, yurt or cabin. Hollow-core synthetic insulation delivers a balance of compressibility, warmth and durability; bag continues to insulate when wet and dries quickly.

Shell fabric is treated with a Durable Water Repellent finish to repel moisture and stains. Main body features a smooth polyester taffeta lining that breathes for comfort and feels great against skin. Brushed polyester knit lining panels near the head and face offer the softness of your favorite T-shirt with the moisture-wicking properties of a high-tech fabric. Layered offset quilt construction eliminates cold spots. Bag can be used by itself or connected to another REI Siesta sleeping bag via the Comfort Connection Zip to form a double bag. Full side and bottom zipper access; bag can be completely unzipped and opened up for use as a comforter. Zipper is backed by wide, antisnag binding tape.
