{"sku":"839243","manufacturer_id":"BD1150460000186","brand_name":"Black Diamond","product_name":"Black Diamond Drift Telemark / Randonee Skis - 2011 Closeout","long_description":"The Black Diamond Drift skis cruise through soft snow with a semi-rockered tip and 100mm waist, and they're light enough to take on long backcountry trips in search of untracked terrain. Efficient Series ski construction uses less material overall than the Black Diamond Power Series, resulting in a lighter-weight ski with just a touch less torsional power. Semi-rockered tips and 100mm waists provide excellent flotation in deep powder. Formula One Technology(TM) with carbon fiber reinforcements features 3 ribs that run the length of the ski to deliver liveliness and power for hard-charging skiing. Lightweight paulownia wood cores surrounded by Torsion Box construction provide torsional power and energy pop. Torsion Box technology wraps fiberglass around the core like a burrito, creating powerful energy pop. Efficient-series skis feature flat tails you can easily plunge into firm snow when building anchors or staking out a tent. Stainless-steel notches at the tails keep climbing skins securely attached and centered. High-speed sintered bases on the Black Diamond Drift skis feature a cross-hatch stone grind for the best balance of durability, glide and maintenance. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.
