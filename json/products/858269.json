{"sku":"858269","manufacturer_id":"13M031","brand_name":"Topo Athletic","product_name":"Topo Athletic M-RR Road-Running Shoes - Men's","long_description":"The Topo Athletic M-RR men's road-running shoes feature ultralight uppers, a quick-lace system and a split-toe, zero-drop design for speed-oriented shoes that feel like second skin. Boa(R) dial-closure system offers a sock-like upper with built-in nylon-covered steel laces you can adjust by twisting the dial; to release, just pull the dial outward. Split-toe design creates a unique anchor point in the forefoot, offering a snug fit; open toe box allows the remaning toes to spread naturally for comfort and optimal feel. 0mm heel-to-toe drop encourages a midfoot/forefoot strike, reducing heel strike impact and braking. Ultralight mesh uppers with microfiber overlays provide excellent breathability and just the right amount of structure. Welded seam construction reduces weight as well as chafing and irritation against skin. Removable EVA footbed provides cushioning and odor resistance. Durable rubber outsoles on the Topo Athletic M-RR men's training shoes offer reliable traction on a variety of surfaces. All-synthetic construction makes these vegan-friendly.","short_description":"The Topo Athletic M-RR men's road-running shoes feature ultralight uppers, a quick-lace system and a split-toe, zero-drop design for speed-oriented shoes that feel like second skin.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Men's Footwear","product_group":"Men's Shoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s385939.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l385939.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=385939&tt=df","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=385939\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m385939.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=858269&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8582690002":{"sku":"8582690002","vendor_sku":"13M031","upc":"810050020718","size":"8.5","color":"BLACK/GREEN","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"},"8582690003":{"sku":"8582690003","vendor_sku":"13M031","upc":"810050020725","size":"9","color":"BLACK/GREEN","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"},"8582690004":{"sku":"8582690004","vendor_sku":"13M031","upc":"810050020732","size":"9.5","color":"BLACK/GREEN","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"},"8582690005":{"sku":"8582690005","vendor_sku":"13M031","upc":"810050020749","size":"10","color":"BLACK/GREEN","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"},"8582690006":{"sku":"8582690006","vendor_sku":"13M031","upc":"810050020756","size":"10.5","color":"BLACK/GREEN","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"},"8582690007":{"sku":"8582690007","vendor_sku":"13M031","upc":"810050020763","size":"11","color":"BLACK/GREEN","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"},"8582690008":{"sku":"8582690008","vendor_sku":"13M031","upc":"810050020770","size":"11.5","color":"BLACK/GREEN","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"}},"categories":["footwear","mens-footwear","mens-shoes"]}
