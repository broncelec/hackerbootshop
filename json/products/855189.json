{"sku":"855189","manufacturer_id":"25137","brand_name":"Patagonia","product_name":"Patagonia R2 Fleece Jacket - Men's","long_description":"While it's so soft you'll want to wear it everyday, the Patagonia R2 fleece jacket for men is a technical piece that offers breathable, stretchy warmth under a shell for cold-weather alpine climbing. Mapping of two types of Polartec(R) fleece fabrics keeps the fit more refined and lower in bulk than ever without loss of insulation. Main body is Polartec(R) Thermal Pro(R) that is breathable, compressible, moisture wicking and quick drying, and offers a superior warmth-to-weight ratio. Side panels, underarms and lower torso are Polartec(R) Power Dry(R) high/low grid fleece for improved fit, shape retention and abrasion resistance. Offset seams provide comfort under a pack; gussets reduce underarm lift. Center-front zipper is supple with low-bulk seaming; soft, kissing-welt zipper garage at chin provides next-to-skin comfort. Discreet, on-seam thumb loops on the cuffs of the Patagonia R2 fleece jacket for men add coverage. High hand pockets and single chest pocket have slim zippers and zipper garages, and are harness- and pack-compatible; two internal drop-in mesh pockets.","short_description":"While it's so soft you'll want to wear it everyday, the Patagonia R2 fleece jacket for men is a technical piece that offers breathable, stretchy warmth under a shell for cold-weather alpine climbing.","category":"Men's","subcategory":"Men's Jackets","product_group":"Men's Fleece Jackets","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s342179.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l342179.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=342179&tt=df","keywords":"top,hiking,fleece,hike,jacket","retail_price":"169.00","sale_price":"169.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=342179\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m342179.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=855189&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8551890004":{"sku":"8551890004","vendor_sku":"25137","upc":"887187209590","size":"XL","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"169.00","sale_price":"169.00"}}}
