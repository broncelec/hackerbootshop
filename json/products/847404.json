{"sku":"847404","manufacturer_id":"CSB11015LOL","brand_name":"Nemo","product_name":"NEMO Nocturne 15 Sleeping Bag","long_description":"Featuring the new NEMO Spoon(TM) Shape, the Nocturne 15 down sleeping bag strays from the traditional mummy shape to match the way you actually sleep. The new NEMO Spoon Shape is wide in the shoulders, tapers to the hips and then gently flares back out to allow room for the natural bend and shift of knees. DownTek(TM) 700-fill-power duck down is treated with a micro-thin polymer so it will repel water and maintain loft and insulation value, even in the wettest conditions. A nifty little feature in the hood is the tuckable Blanket Fold(TM), an insulated flap of fabric that can be wrapped around your neck to block drafts and add warmth. Vertical baffle construction curves to the shape of your body; construction keeps down from shifting around, preventing cold spots. Footbox has a waterproof/breathable coating on the backside of the fabric that combines with a Durable Water Repellent finish on the exterior to protect from tent condensation. Includes a pillow pocket to hold your pillow (sold separately) and a zippered watch pocket so you'll hear your alarm go off in the morning. NEMO Nocturne 15 down sleeping bag comes with a roll-top compression stuff sack and a storage bag.","short_description":"Featuring the new NEMO Spoon(TM) Shape, the Nocturne 15 down sleeping bag strays from the traditional mummy shape to match the way you actually sleep.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags And Accessories","product_group":"Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s421383.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l421383.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=421383&tt=df","keywords":"compact","retail_price":"419.95","sale_price":"419.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=421383\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m421383.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=847404&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8474040003":{"sku":"8474040003","vendor_sku":"CSB11015REL","upc":"814041012058","size":"Regular Left","color":"ALUMINUM/CLOVER","retail_price":"399.95","sale_price":"399.95"},"8474040004":{"sku":"8474040004","vendor_sku":"CSB11015LOL","upc":"814041012072","size":"Long Left","color":"ALUMINUM/CLOVER","retail_price":"419.95","sale_price":"419.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sleeping-bags-and-accessories","sleeping-bags"]}
