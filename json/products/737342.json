{"sku":"737342","manufacturer_id":"262010","brand_name":"Black Diamond","product_name":"Black Diamond Camalot C3 Cams","long_description":"The new Black Diamond(R) Camalot(TM) C3 cams feature an interlocking cam design for greater placement versatility and reliability. Explore a new world of placement possibilities with the revolutionary, patent-pending interlocking cam design, even fitting tight pin scars with ease. Uses up to 30% less head width than other three-cam units, fitting in a far greater number of places more securely. Independently driven by patent-pending compression drive springs for increased holding force in tough placements. Huge cam stops prevent over-rotation and offer ample passive umbrella strength like the double-axle models. Easy-to-place ribbed trigger and thumb rest improve handling when arms are pumped. C3 cam's stem design is ID-colored and offers superb flexibility and strength--laterally stiff for tight placements and soft over edges. Stainless-steel cables are flexible to disperse loads more evenly, minimizing deformation and making cam units inherently stronger. Color-coded nylon slings coincide with stem for easy identification.","short_description":"The new Black Diamond(R) Camalot(TM) C3 cams feature an interlocking cam design for greater placement versatility and reliability.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Protection","product_group":"Cams","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s407103.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l407103.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=407103&tt=df","retail_price":"59.95","sale_price":"59.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=407103\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m407103.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=737342&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7373420012":{"sku":"7373420012","vendor_sku":"262000","upc":"793661081487","size":"Grey","color":"Size 000","retail_price":"59.95","sale_price":"59.95"},"7373420038":{"sku":"7373420038","vendor_sku":"262002","upc":"793661081500","size":"Green","color":"Size 0","retail_price":"59.95","sale_price":"59.95"},"7373420046":{"sku":"7373420046","vendor_sku":"262010","upc":"793661081517","size":"Red","color":"Size 1","retail_price":"59.95","sale_price":"59.95"},"7373420061":{"sku":"7373420061","vendor_sku":"262001","upc":"793661081494","size":"Purple","color":"Size 00","retail_price":"59.95","sale_price":"59.95"},"7373420079":{"sku":"7373420079","vendor_sku":"262020","upc":"793661081524","size":"Yellow","color":"Size 2","retail_price":"59.95","sale_price":"59.95"}},"categories":["climbing","climbing-protection","cams"]}
