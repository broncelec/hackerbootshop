This 3-compartment pack lets you carry enough gear to linger, but not so much that you get bogged down. Main compartment holds much of the load and comes with a raised, padded sleeve with buckle closure that protects up to a 17 in. laptop. The sleeve, equipped with a tube port, accepts a hydration reservoir (sold separately). Pens, business cards, keys and other small necessities go inside a second pocket. Exterior vertical zip pocket provides quick access to a wallet, plane tickets and a phone; microfleece-lined pocket protects sunglasses or an audio device. Stretch-woven side pockets accommodate a full range of water-bottle shapes and sizes. Airflow mesh on the shoulder straps and back panel prevent overheating. Sternum strap has an emergency whistle; compression straps stabilize contents. Patagonia Refugio also features a top-mounted, reinforced haul handle and exterior lash points. Made from 420-denier 100% nylon oxford plain weave, with an 840-denier 100% ballistics nylon bottom; all fabrics have a Durable Water Repellent finish.","short_description":"You'll find refuge from too much stuff when you carry the Refugio daypack.
