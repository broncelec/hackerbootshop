{"sku":"761270","manufacturer_id":"490216","brand_name":"Black Diamond","product_name":" Black Diamond Express Ice Screw","long_description":"Often regarded as one of the fastest and most easily placed ice screws around, the Black Diamond Express ice screw bites into ice for quick and easy placement. Large crank knob is easier to grab than on previous models yet still offers uninterrupted 360deg motion without the use of an ice tool. Foldable, color-coded crank provides quick length identification. Stainless-steel hanger is lighter than previous models, won't rust and reduces melt-out on sunny routes. Large second clip-in point helps manage belay organization.","short_description":"Often regarded as one of the fastest and most easily placed ice screws around, the Black Diamond Express ice screw bites into ice for quick and easy placement.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Mountaineering Gear","product_group":"Snow And Ice Protection","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s407599.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l407599.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=407599&tt=df","retail_price":"59.95","sale_price":"59.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=407599\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m407599.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=761270&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7612700018":{"sku":"7612700018","vendor_sku":"490222","upc":"793661092995","size":"22 CM","retail_price":"59.95","sale_price":"59.95"},"7612700026":{"sku":"7612700026","vendor_sku":"490216","upc":"793661092971","size":"16 CM","retail_price":"59.95","sale_price":"59.95"},"7612700042":{"sku":"7612700042","vendor_sku":"490219","upc":"793661092988","size":"19 CM","retail_price":"59.95","sale_price":"59.95"}}}
