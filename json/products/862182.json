The rear part of the frame and the carbon-bladed fork feature the Cannondale Synapse Active Vibration Elimination (S.A.V.E.) technology for damping road vibration. Promax Render disc brakes offer powerful braking with nuanced control for excellent performance in any conditions. Shimano 105 levers and derailleurs supply precise, dependable shifts throughout the 20 gears. BB30 bottom bracket enhances stiffness for more efficient power transfer. FSA Gossamer compact crankset and a wide-ranging 12-30 tooth cassette deliver a wide spread of gearing options for easy spinning no matter the gradient. Schwalbe Lugano tires supply low rolling-resistance and grippy handling. Specs on the Cannondale Synapse Alloy 5 Compact women's road bike are subject to change.","short_description":"With disc brakes for all-weather stopping power, the Cannondale Synapse Alloy 5 Disc Compact women's road bike offers trusty Shimano 105 components with a speedy-yet-comfortable frame for long rides.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bikes","product_group":"Road Bikes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s374675.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l374675.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=374675&tt=df","retail_price":"1459.00","sale_price":"1459.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=374675\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m374675.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=862182&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8621820001":{"sku":"8621820001","vendor_sku":"CF24074401","upc":"884603522509","size":"44 CM","color":"JET BLACK MATTE","retail_price":"1459.00","sale_price":"1459.00"},"8621820002":{"sku":"8621820002","vendor_sku":"CF24074801","upc":"884603522516","size":"48 CM","color":"JET BLACK MATTE","retail_price":"1459.00","sale_price":"1459.00"},"8621820003":{"sku":"8621820003","vendor_sku":"CF24075101","upc":"884603522523","size":"51 CM","color":"JET BLACK MATTE","retail_price":"1459.00","sale_price":"1459.00"},"8621820004":{"sku":"8621820004","vendor_sku":"CF24075401","upc":"884603522530","size":"54 CM","color":"JET BLACK MATTE","retail_price":"1459.00","sale_price":"1459.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bikes","road-bikes"]}
