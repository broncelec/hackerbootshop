{"sku":"846610","manufacturer_id":"TSUL113","brand_name":"Big Agnes","product_name":" Big Agnes Slater UL1+ Tent","long_description":"The Big Agnes Slater UL1+ tent gets its inspiration from the Fly Creek UL series tents. The Slater is light and fast like the Fly Creek, but comes with extra floor space and the absence of mesh. Extra space comes at little cost in terms of weight, and the lightweight, breathable ripstop nylon walls offer an extra bit of warmth, privacy and protection. Lightweight and strong DAC Featherlite(R) NSL poles with press-fit connectors and a lightweight hub use an anodization process with fewer chemicals than other processes. DAC Twist clips attach tent body to the pole frame for quick and easy set up. Color-coded pole ends, webbing and buckles make setting up the Big Agnes Slater UL1+ tent effortless. Woven nylon mesh tent door helps ventilate tent; ripstop nylon walls are especially effective at keeping the sand and wind out of the tent when you head to the desert. Rainfly and seamless floor are made of polyurethane- and silicone-coated high-tenacity ripstop nylon; seams are taped with waterproof, solvent-free polyurethane tape. Stormflap over vestibule zipper prevents water drips. Fly vent improves ventilation to reduce condensation; reflective guyout and reflective webbing on tent corners increase visibility at night. Includes interior mesh pockets and gear loft loops for storage; 11 superlight aluminum stakes and stuff sacks also included. For a lightweight setup during nice weather leave tent body behind; use the rainfly and footprint (sold separately) with the poles and stakes.","short_description":"The Big Agnes Slater UL1+ tent gets its inspiration from the Fly Creek UL series tents.
