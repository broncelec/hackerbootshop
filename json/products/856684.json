{"sku":"856684","manufacturer_id":"20203-1","brand_name":"Saucony","product_name":" Saucony Xodus 4.0 GTX Trail-Running Shoes - Men's","long_description":"The waterproof Saucony Xodus 4.0 GTX trail-running shoes tackle tough terrain with nimble, cushioned performance so you can get out and go, even on sloppy wet trails. GORE-TEX(R) waterproof liners supply a great fit and let feet breathe while protecting them from the weather, keeping feet dry and comfortable. Gusseted tongues keep trail debris out; uppers are also compatible with gaiters (not included) for increased protection. 4mm heel-to-toe drop encourages a shorter, lower impact stride than traditional running shoes do. Midfoot support bands are integrated into the lacing for an snug overall fit and feel when you cinch the laces tight; shoes include lace garages on the tongues. Thermoplastic urethane plates provide torsional rigidity and protect feet from rocks. Saucony Xodus 4.0 GTX trail-running shoes have Vibram(R) rubber outsoles with multidirectional lugs, providing aggressive traction for tackling trails.","short_description":"The waterproof Saucony Xodus 4.0 GTX trail-running shoes tackle tough terrain with nimble, cushioned performance so you can get out and go, even on sloppy wet trails.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Men's Footwear","product_group":"Men's Shoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s385887.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l385887.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=385887&tt=df","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=385887\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m385887.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=856684&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8566840001":{"sku":"8566840001","vendor_sku":"20203-1","upc":"720026504930","size":"8","color":"BLACK/GREEN/CITRON","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"},"8566840002":{"sku":"8566840002","vendor_sku":"20203-1","upc":"720026504947","size":"8.5","color":"BLACK/GREEN/CITRON","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"},"8566840003":{"sku":"8566840003","vendor_sku":"20203-1","upc":"720026522439","size":"9","color":"BLACK/GREEN/CITRON","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"},"8566840005":{"sku":"8566840005","vendor_sku":"20203-1","upc":"720026522453","size":"10","color":"BLACK/GREEN/CITRON","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"},"8566840007":{"sku":"8566840007","vendor_sku":"20203-1","upc":"720026522477","size":"11","color":"BLACK/GREEN/CITRON","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"},"8566840008":{"sku":"8566840008","vendor_sku":"20203-1","upc":"720026522484","size":"11.5","color":"BLACK/GREEN/CITRON","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"}},"categories":["footwear","mens-footwear","mens-shoes"]}
