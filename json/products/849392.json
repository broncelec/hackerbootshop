{"sku":"849392","manufacturer_id":"32654914","brand_name":"Mavic","product_name":"Mavic Ksyrium SLR Wheelset with Tires","long_description":"Built for pure performance, the Mavic Ksyrium SLR wheelset is all about speed-featherweight, stiff and responsive speed-and comes outfitted with tires for race readiness out of the box. 22mm deep front and 25mm deep rear rims are strengthened where the spokes exert the greatest stress; rear rim utilizes an asymmetric shape to enhance stiffness and durability. Lightweight yet strong proprietary aluminum rims have a drilling method that doesn't penetrate the tube-facing wall, strengthening rim and eliminating the need for rim strips. Both rims feature a milled braking surface to improve friction; rim joints are welded and milled to eliminate shuddering during braking and provide superior wheel balance. Inter Spoke Milling reduces material between spokes, lowering weight and the amount of effort needed to spin the wheels up for superb climbing and acceleration. Rear hub features a lightweight and stiff aluminum hub body with pawls that are backed by stainless-steel inserts for reliable, strong engagement and power transfer. Both hubs boast a microadjustable system that lets you dial in bearing performance; double-sealed cartridge bearings deliver excellent longevity and smooth spinning. Front wheel features radially laced, straight-pull bladed spokes made of a very lightweight, stiff alloy for minimal weight and exacting performance. Rear wheel boasts a blend of round carbon spokes (non-drive-side, radial lacing) and bladed alloy spokes (drive side, 2 cross) to maximize stiffness and minimize weight. Yksion Pro 700x23c clincher tires are included, offering front- and rear-specific performance for maximizing grip up front and minimizing rolling resistance in the back. Both tires have supple 127 tpi casings and are backed with a superior, puncture-resistant Kevlar(R) breaker; maximum recommended pressure of 130 psi (9 bar). Please note: tubes use Presta valves.","short_description":"Built for pure performance, the Mavic Ksyrium SLR wheelset is all about speed-featherweight, stiff and responsive speed-and comes outfitted with tires for race readiness out of the box.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Components","product_group":"Bike Tires, Tubes And Wheels","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s389575.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l389575.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=389575&tt=df","retail_price":"1799.95","sale_price":"1799.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=389575\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m389575.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=849392&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8493920001":{"sku":"8493920001","vendor_sku":"32654914","upc":"080694951185","size":"700C","retail_price":"1799.95","sale_price":"1799.95"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-components","bike-tires-tubes-and-wheels"]}
