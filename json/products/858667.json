{"sku":"858667","manufacturer_id":"10163100051","brand_name":"Tecnica","product_name":"Tecnica Cochise Pro Light Randonee Boots - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Responsive and powerful on the descent, the Tecnica Cochise Pro Light randonee boots are compatible with Dynafit-style bindings and have a hiking mode so you can seek out untouched powder stashes. With a stiff flex index of 120, Tecnica Cochise Pro Light randonee boots provide the responsive power transfer preferred by aggressive skiers, yet weight only 3,220g per pair. Ski/hike switch frees upper cuff to work with your stride and makes it easy to hike for your turns. Steel and aluminum, metal-pin-to-metal-plate connection locks the upper cuff to the lower shell when you're ready to ski and allows you to really flex into your skis. Lightweight, mono-injected polymer shell is designed to make it easy going uphill, and it provides the responsive power you need on the way back down. Boots come with tech soles installed that allow compatibility with Dynafit-style bindings and other randonee bindings; alpine DIN-compatible soles are available separately. Soft plastic over instep makes it easy to get your feet in the boots. Liners offer superior heel hold, complete foot envelopment and rubberized shock absorption in the tongue, foot and heel. Custom-formable liners can be heated in a specialty ski shop to achieve a personalized fit. Neoprene toe boxes increase warmth in feet and absorb vibrations. Instep catch is hinged, allowing excellent pressure distribution; plus, it pivots away from the shell, letting the shell spread for easy entry. Cuff alignment system aligns the cuff to follow the shape of the lower leg increasing comfort and enhancing performance. Tecnica Cochise 120 ski boots also feature removable spoilers and sticky arches designed for hiking in snow.","short_description":"Responsive and powerful on the descent, the Tecnica Cochise Pro Light randonee boots are compatible with Dynafit-style bindings and have a hiking mode so you can seek out untouched powder stashes.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Randonee Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382739.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382739.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382739&tt=df","retail_price":"799.95","sale_price":"559.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382739\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382739.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=858667&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8586670003":{"sku":"8586670003","vendor_sku":"10163100051","upc":"885315236777","size":"Mondo 28.5","color":"ACID GREEN BLACK","retail_price":"559.83","sale_price":"559.83"}},"categories":["snow","ski-boots","randonee-ski-boots"]}
