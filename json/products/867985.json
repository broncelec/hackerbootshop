Simply place 1 of the 2 included hydrogen fuel cores into the charger to power USB devices such as smartphones, tablets, GPS, UV water purifiers or rechargeable lights. Exchange empty for full cartridges and keep charging without waiting; each core is capable of up to 6 iPhone recharges. No toxic chemicals-solid-state cores recharge from water with no natural discharge. 2 cores produce power equal to more than 30 AA batteries, putting out 2 amps at 5 volts-enough to charge a smartphone up to 6 times. The Brunton Hydrogen Reactor Charger uses cores that can be recycled and do not lose their capacity over time; recharge cores with the Brunton Hydrolizer (sold separately).","short_description":"The Brunton Hydrogen Reactor Charger uses cutting-edge science, combining hydrogen with oxygen to produce electricity for clean, portable and rechargeable power.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Camp Electronics","product_group":"Solar And Portable Power","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s413247.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l413247.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=413247&tt=df","keywords":"rechargeable batteries,charger","retail_price":"149.95","sale_price":"149.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=413247\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m413247.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=867985&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8679850002":{"sku":"8679850002","vendor_sku":"F-REACTOR-YL","upc":"080078915024","color":"YELLOW","retail_price":"149.95","sale_price":"149.95"},"8679850003":{"sku":"8679850003","vendor_sku":"F-REACTOR-OR","upc":"080078915048","color":"ORANGE","retail_price":"149.95","sale_price":"149.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","camp-electronics","solar-and-portable-power"]}
