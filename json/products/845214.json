You'll never dread a rainy backpacking trip again. DownTek 700-fill-power duck down repels water employing nano technology and a proprietary process to apply a micro-thin polymer to the down. DownTek down repels water and maintains loft and insulation value, even when exposed to moisture. European Norm (EN) comfort rating of 15degF makes the bag suitable for 3-season use and occasional winter outings. Proprietary application process creates a water repellent, antimicrobial and antibacterial down insulation that actually floats on water. Vertical chambers with internal mesh gates keep insulation from shifting up and down. Traditional style mummy bag is designed without the integrated pad sleeve (normally found on Big Agnes System bags) and features full insulation underneath. European Norm (EN) is an independent third-party temperature rating, allowing accurate comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags.

Down-filled collar at top seals around the neck to prevent warm air from escaping and cold air from entering. Large draft tube located behind the zipper prevents warm air from escaping and cold air from entering. Interior fabric loops stabilize a sleeping bag liner, sold separately. 2-way, full-length YKK zipper zips to other bags of opposite configuration. The women's Big Agnes Lithia Spring SL mummy sleeping bag includes a mesh storage sack and a nylon stuff sack.","short_description":"The women's Big Agnes Lithia Spring SL mummy sleeping bag features DownTek(TM) water-repellent down insulation.
