{"sku":"761269","manufacturer_id":"412079","brand_name":"Black Diamond","product_name":"Black Diamond Cobra Ice Tool - Adze","long_description":"Switch seamlessly from mixed climbing to alpine ventures with the redesigned Black Diamond Cobra adze ice tool. Refinements include increased clearance, reduced weight and improved stiffness, making it evermore versatile. Carbon fiber shaft is lightweight yet strong, and bent to provide a natural, solid swing; shaft has the greatest clearance of any Black Diamond tool. Shaft is balanced with weight in head for damp, accurate strikes with little rebound and vibration as the pick enters the ice. Laser pick has a thin taper and low-volume tip that penetrates easily, with little displacement of ice. Adze chops and cleans steps and anchor placements. Rubberized and ergonomically curved rubber handle offers a secure and comfortable grip, even when cold and wet. Includes the Cobra/Viper Fang and Strike to protect and support hands while leashless climbing. Modular head design allows pick and adze to be removed and replaced.","short_description":"Switch seamlessly from mixed climbing to alpine ventures with the redesigned Black Diamond Cobra adze ice tool.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Mountaineering Gear","product_group":"Ice Axes And Tools","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s407539.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l407539.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=407539&tt=df","retail_price":"339.95","sale_price":"339.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=407539\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m407539.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=761269&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7612690011":{"sku":"7612690011","vendor_sku":"412079","upc":"793661092940","color":"CARBON","retail_price":"339.95","sale_price":"339.95"}},"categories":["climbing","mountaineering-gear","ice-axes-and-tools"]}
