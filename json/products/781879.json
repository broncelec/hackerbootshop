{"sku":"781879","manufacturer_id":"CA 2 F12 220 RE","brand_name":"Werner","product_name":" Werner Camano Small-Shaft Paddle","long_description":"An improved ferrule design and translucent, midsize blades add value to this small-shaft Camano paddle from Werner. Small diameter paddle shaft lessens fatigue and improves comfort for paddlers with small hands. Top-quality fiberglass and carbon blend creates a durable, lightweight and well-balanced paddle. Carefully handcrafted using a pressure molding process to achieve the right balance between weight and durability. Adjustable Ferrule System allows elegant adjustment of feathering angle from 0deg - 60deg right or left in 15deg increments. Improved ferrule design incorporates internal printing of offset degrees and a low-profile button release that makes paddle feel like 1 piece. Asymmetrical blade shape helps reduce torque, allowing paddle to pull smoothly through the water and reducing the need to grip tightly. Strong dihedral power face reduces flutter to create exceptionally smooth forward strokes. Beautifully crafted translucent blades glow brilliantly on the water and increase visibility. Drip rings help keep hands and lap dry. 2-piece design breaks down quickly and eases transport and storage.","short_description":"An improved ferrule design and translucent, midsize blades add value to this small-shaft Camano paddle from Werner.","category":"Paddling","subcategory":"Paddles","product_group":"Kayak Paddles","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s430999.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l430999.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=430999&tt=df","retail_price":"275.00","sale_price":"275.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=430999\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m430999.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=781879&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7818790011":{"sku":"7818790011","vendor_sku":"CA 2 F12 220 RE","upc":"840463102879","size":"220 CM","color":"RED","retail_price":"275.00","sale_price":"275.00"},"7818790029":{"sku":"7818790029","vendor_sku":"CA 2 F12 230 RE","upc":"478187900299","size":"230 Cm","color":"RED","retail_price":"275.00","sale_price":"275.00"},"7818790037":{"sku":"7818790037","vendor_sku":"CA 2 F12 240 RE","upc":"478187900374","size":"240 Cm","color":"RED","retail_price":"275.00","sale_price":"275.00"}},"categories":["paddling","paddles","kayak-paddles"]}
