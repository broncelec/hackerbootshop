Women-specific design helps you stay warm with increased insulation in torso area-a key heat-loss area for women-and extra padding in hip area. Pad features a die-cut foam center panel and full length, raised tubes on the outside (insulated with PrimaLoft(R) synthetic down microfiber) to keep you from rolling off. Foam insulation is cross-cored and engineered to be lightweight, compressible and stable. Quick-closing, high-volume airflow valve allows the pad to inflate and deflate quickly. 75-denier polyester construction with a hexagonal embossed surface provides durability and a nonslip surface; 75-denier polyester bottom resists wear. REI AirRail 1.5 sleeping pad has a fully welded construction that's leakproof and durable. Low-volume, tapered, mummy-shape design increases efficiency and compressibility. R-value equals 4.2; R-value is the measurement of resistance to the flow of heat through a material; the higher the R-value, the greater the insulation provided. Included stuff sack protects pad during transport and ensures a compact parcel every time.","short_description":"Whether you're backpacking the high plains or hiking at high altitude, the self-inflating REI AirRail 1.5 women's sleeping pad is lightweight and takes up little space in your backpack.","category":"Camping & Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Pads","product_group":"Sleeping Pads","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s299171.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l299171.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=299171&tt=df","keywords":"sleeping pad,sleep,sleepingpad,mattress,sleeping","retail_price":"89.50","sale_price":"89.50","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=299171\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m299171.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=857477&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8574770001":{"sku":"8574770001","vendor_sku":"14473","upc":"484529900018","size":"Regular","color":"TEAL SURF","retail_price":"89.50","sale_price":"89.50"}}}
