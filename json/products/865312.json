{"sku":"865312","manufacturer_id":"40152514","brand_name":"Sierra Designs","product_name":" Sierra Designs Flashlight 2 UL Tent","long_description":"The 3-season Sierra Designs Flashlight 2 UL tent is a 2-person backpacking tent for those who believe that comfort and light weight shouldn't be mutually exclusive. Hybrid double/single wall design reduces weight and helps ensure quick, dry setup. Leave the tent poles behind and use trekking poles (sold separately) instead to reduce minimum weight to less than 3 lbs. Two large doors offer both occupants individual access; they create an open, airy feel and allow effective cross-ventilation to control condensation. Awnings with 8-in. overhangs provide dry entry and exit as well as shade from the sun; they let you leave the doors or windows open, even when it's raining. Gear closet lets you store gear where it should be-away from the door; it can be closed or left open for additional venting. With only 6 stakeout points, the Sierra Designs Flashlight UL 2 boasts easy setup and eliminates the restaking associated with most tarp tents and trekking pole shelters.","short_description":"The 3-season Sierra Designs Flashlight 2 UL tent is a 2-person backpacking tent for those who believe that comfort and light weight shouldn't be mutually exclusive.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Tents","product_group":"Backpacking Tents","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s424115.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l424115.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=424115&tt=df","retail_price":"359.95","sale_price":"359.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=424115\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m424115.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=865312&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8653120001":{"sku":"8653120001","vendor_sku":"40152514","upc":"054003745079","color":"SD TAN/SD YELLOW","retail_price":"359.95","sale_price":"359.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","tents","backpacking-tents"]}
