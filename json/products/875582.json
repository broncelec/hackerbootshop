{"sku":"875582","manufacturer_id":"F1700306","brand_name":"Fizik","product_name":" Fizik Aliante Gamma X K:ium Saddle - Men's","long_description":"With a deep center channel for comfort, the 259g Fizik Aliante Gamma X K:ium Bike Saddle offers a high-performance saddle for less-than-limber cyclists. Aliante Gamma X K:ium offers support for cyclists with restricted flexibility-when bent over, one's hands hang just below knees and cannot touch toes. Synthetic Microtex cover is durable, water resistant and washable, and will not fade; plus, it's lighter than leather. Central channel spans the length of the saddle to offer a relief zone for sensitive tissues. Nylon/carbon-reinforced shell provides lightweight support and comfort. K:ium alloy rails offer an excellent strength-to-weight ratio and comfort-enhancing vibration damping.","short_description":"With a deep center channel for comfort, the 259g Fizik Aliante Gamma X K:ium Bike Saddle offers a high-performance saddle for less-than-limber cyclists.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Components","product_group":"Bike Saddles And Seatposts","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s456483.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l456483.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=456483&tt=df","retail_price":"149.00","sale_price":"149.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=456483\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m456483.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=875582&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8755820001":{"sku":"8755820001","vendor_sku":"F1700306","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"149.00","sale_price":"149.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-components","bike-saddles-and-seatposts"]}
