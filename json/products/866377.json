{"sku":"866377","manufacturer_id":"234005-006","brand_name":"Scott","product_name":"Scott Scale 750 27.5 Bike - 2014","long_description":"The Scott Scale 750 27.5 Mountain Bike offers 27.5 in. wheels for quick acceleration and excellent control with a precise, 30-speed Shimano component set to supply excellent trail performance. Scott Scale 750 is quicker and lighter than 29ers, but offers the same benefits of large-diameter wheels-more speed and better traction. Compared to 26 in. wheels, larger-diameter wheels roll over obstacles more easily so you won't stall going uphill over roots and loose soil. Lightweight, butted aluminum frame is tuned to optimize efficiency in the climbs and remain responsive when descending. Fox 32 Float Evolution CTD Air suspension fork has 120mm of air-sprung travel; bar-top remote lockout lets you control suspension on the fly. Shimano XT Shadow rear derailleur, SLX shifters and SLX front derailleur offer buttery smooth shifting throughout the 30 gear combinations. Shimano hydraulic disc brakes provide easy, progressive braking. Sturdy wheels are wrapped with the excellent all-arounder Schwalbe Rocket Ron tires to ensure great traction and fast-rolling performance on the trail.
