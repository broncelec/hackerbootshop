{"sku":"854707","brand_name":"Patagonia","product_name":"Patagonia Untracked Shell Pants - Women's","long_description":"Earn turns by trudging up steep bootpack or carve lines in pristine pow in the women's Patagonia Untracked rugged shell pants with an articulated fit and 3-layer Gore-Tex(R) waterproof protection. 3-layer Gore-Tex waterproof, breathable shell fabric offers excellent, long-lasting protection from blustery cold winds to wet snow. Durable Water Repellent finish causes water to bead up and roll off, fending off melting snow to help keep you dry. Embedded RECCO(R) reflector enhances radio signals from search-and-rescue RECCO detectors, helping speed up the search for a buried avalanche victim. Mesh-lined thigh vents let you release excess body heat while keeping out snow. Loop at rear of waistband lets you securely connect a compatible Patagonia jacket's powder skirt to the pants for an integrated riding system (jacket sold separately). Brushed lining on waistband wicks sweat and provides against-the-skin comfort; zip-fly, two-snap closure and adjustable waistband tabs provide a personalized fit. Snow gaiters securely wrap around boots to keep snow from entering pants; scuff guards protect insides of legs and cuffs from abrasion and sharp edges. Gusseted crotch and articulated knees on the women's Patagonia Untracked shell pants allow unrestricted movement for deep knee drops and ease when skinning up. Zippered handwarmer pockets; zippered thigh cargo pockets; single zippered back pocket.","short_description":"Earn turns by trudging up steep bootpack or carve lines in pristine pow in the women's Patagonia Untracked rugged shell pants with an articulated fit and 3-layer Gore-Tex(R) waterproof protection.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Women's Ski Clothing","product_group":"Women's Ski Pants","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s338847.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l338847.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=338847&tt=df","keywords":"pant,snowpant,pants,hardshell pants,snow pants","retail_price":"449.00","sale_price":"449.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=338847\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m338847.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=854707&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8547070008":{"sku":"8547070008","vendor_sku":"29910","upc":"887187114771","size":"M","color":"IKAT PURPLE","retail_price":"449.00","sale_price":"449.00"}}}
