{"sku":"857017","manufacturer_id":"SJ140142","brand_name":"Jones","product_name":"Jones Mountain Twin Snowboard - 2013/2014","long_description":"Ridiculously fun to ride whether zipping down groomers, floating through powder or throwing down frontside 180s, the Jones Mountain Twin snowboard is your ticket to all-mountain fun. Twin profile and blunt nose keep you floating while the mellow Magne-Traction locks in stability when the fresh tracks are gone. Mellow Magne-Traction improves edge grip by adding five contact points along the running length of the board, resulting in amazing control whether riding ice or pow. Camrock, a distinctive rocker/camber flex pattern, evenly balances tip and tail rocker and slight camber between the bindings. Full wood core is comfortable and robust; it's a true all-terrain core and certified by the Forest Stewardship Council; fiberglass enhances the flex and board feel. Carbon stringers improve pop and torsional stiffness, and increase the longevity of the flex profile. Film topsheet saves weight over traditional plastic topsheets; sintered base absorbs and retains wax; steel edges. P-tex waste is drastically reduced by flip-flopping base graphic colors between boards; base colors are random, thus specific requests cannot be accommodated. .","short_description":"Ridiculously fun to ride whether zipping down groomers, floating through powder or throwing down frontside 180s, the Jones Mountain Twin snowboard is your ticket to all-mountain fun.","category":"Snowboarding","subcategory":"Snowboards","product_group":"Freestyle Snowboards","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s441279.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l441279.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=441279&tt=df","retail_price":"499.00","sale_price":"344.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=441279\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m441279.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=857017&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8570170001":{"sku":"8570170001","vendor_sku":"SJ140142","size":"154 CM","retail_price":"344.83","sale_price":"344.83"}},"categories":["snow","snowboards","freestyle-snowboards"]}
