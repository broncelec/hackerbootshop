{"sku":"862167","manufacturer_id":"CM21415201","brand_name":"Cannondale","product_name":" Cannondale SuperSix EVO 5 Compact Bike - 2014","long_description":"Built for serious racers, the Cannondale SuperSix EVO 5 Compact bike pairs trusty Shimano 105 parts and a competition-ready carbon frame for an ultralight advantage to get you over the finish line. Full-carbon SuperSix EVO frame features a geometry and tube construction that translates any motion you make into forward momentum and all-out speed. Slim, small-diameter tubes on the EVO frame shave off weight, maintain strength and slice through air with aerodynamic efficiency. Transferring your power to the wheel, the oversized bottom bracket area and large, asymmetric chainstays ensure your watts aren't wasted in unnecessary flex. The 1-1/8 - 1.5 in. tapered, full-carbon steerer tube and head tube enhance precision. Shaped seatstays and chainstays help reduce side-to-side flex for energy efficiency while also helping make bumps and road vibrations less jarring. Climb with ease and fly on the descents with the compact FSA Gossamer Pro crankset, which benefits from a stiff and light BB30 bottom bracket design. The compact crank is paired with a 12-27 cassette for 20 gear combinations, all controlled by responsive Shimano 105 shifters and derailleurs. Lightweight and smooth Shimano RS-11 wheels are outfitted with fast and grippy Schwalbe Lugano tires. Specs on the Cannondale SuperSix EVO 5 Compact bike are subject to change.","short_description":"Built for serious racers, the Cannondale SuperSix EVO 5 Compact bike pairs trusty Shimano 105 parts and a competition-ready carbon frame for an ultralight advantage to get you over the finish line.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bikes","product_group":"Road Bikes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s374627.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l374627.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=374627&tt=df","retail_price":"2099.00","sale_price":"2099.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=374627\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m374627.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=862167&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8621670002":{"sku":"8621670002","vendor_sku":"CM21415401","upc":"884603516348","size":"54 CM","color":"TEAM REPLICA GLOSS","retail_price":"2099.00","sale_price":"2099.00"},"8621670003":{"sku":"8621670003","vendor_sku":"CM21415601","upc":"884603516355","size":"56 CM","color":"TEAM REPLICA GLOSS","retail_price":"2099.00","sale_price":"2099.00"},"8621670004":{"sku":"8621670004","vendor_sku":"CM21415801","upc":"884603516362","size":"58 CM","color":"TEAM REPLICA GLOSS","retail_price":"2099.00","sale_price":"2099.00"},"8621670005":{"sku":"8621670005","vendor_sku":"CM21416001","upc":"884603516379","size":"60 CM","color":"TEAM REPLICA GLOSS","retail_price":"2099.00","sale_price":"2099.00"}}}
