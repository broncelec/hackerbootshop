KSO Evo shoes have a max sole thickness of 4.7mm. Individual toe slots enhance dexterity, control and stability to deliver a natural running motion. Zero drop from heel to toe encourages a natural midfoot or forefoot strike to promote forward momentum and reduce the impact of heel striking. Moisture-wicking, antimicrobial Drilex(R) nylon covers the 2mm EVA midsoles providing comfort and cushioning underfoot. A reinforced upper and speed lace allows for easy entry and a snug fit while the zig-zag patterned sole provides grip and flexibility in all directions. Vibram XS Trek rubber outsoles povide good traction. Vibram FiveFingers KSO Evo Cross-Training Shoes are machine washable in cold water; air dry only. To determine size, stand with heels against a wall and measure from the wall to the tip of the longest toe; use the longest toe length in conjunction with the size chart.","short_description":"Part of the Vibram Max-Feel category, the Vibram FiveFingers KSO Evo Cross-Training Shoes offer lots of ground feedback so you can get the most out of the barefoot running technique.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Men's Footwear","product_group":"Men's Shoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s386135.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l386135.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=386135&tt=df","retail_price":"90.00","sale_price":"90.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=386135\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m386135.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=865288&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8652880001":{"sku":"8652880001","vendor_sku":"14M070340","upc":"847100042536","size":"40","color":"BLACK/BLUE","retail_price":"90.00","sale_price":"90.00"},"8652880002":{"sku":"8652880002","vendor_sku":"14M070341","upc":"847100042574","size":"41","color":"BLACK/BLUE","retail_price":"90.00","sale_price":"90.00"},"8652880003":{"sku":"8652880003","vendor_sku":"14M070342","upc":"847100042604","size":"42","color":"BLACK/BLUE","retail_price":"90.00","sale_price":"90.00"},"8652880004":{"sku":"8652880004","vendor_sku":"14M070343","upc":"847100042642","size":"43","color":"BLACK/BLUE","retail_price":"90.00","sale_price":"90.00"},"8652880005":{"sku":"8652880005","vendor_sku":"14M070344","upc":"847100042673","size":"44","color":"BLACK/BLUE","retail_price":"90.00","sale_price":"90.00"},"8652880006":{"sku":"8652880006","vendor_sku":"14M070345","upc":"847100042710","size":"45","color":"BLACK/BLUE","retail_price":"90.00","sale_price":"90.00"}}}
