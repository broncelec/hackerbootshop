All main parts are made of titanium. With 4 sides to choose from, pedal entry is easy and reliable; you'll click in quicker than on any other pedal. Unique design and few moving parts allow reliable entry and release even when gunked up with mud. Titanium spindle, body and wings are super strong and very lightweight. New spring design alleviates wing rattle, spring migration and breakage from fatigue. Pedals feature smooth-operating needle bearings. Watertight and airtight internal parts promote a long life and require little maintenance. 6deg of soft float. Pedals should only be used with the Egg Beater Cleats (included) which will fit almost any SPD-compatible shoe.","short_description":"The Egg Beater 11 pedals are the lightest pedals available from Crank Brothers.
