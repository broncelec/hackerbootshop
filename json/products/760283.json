Easy to wear-tough nylon straps use rip-and-stick fasteners to attach STABILicers to your favorite shoes or boots. Each durable rubber outsole features 17 replaceable case-hardened steel cleats that bite into ice and snow and even rock. Cleats are placed along perimeters of soles to maximize traction and stability through your natural stride. Chevron-patterned tread self-cleans by spitting out snow to deliver consistent traction. Cleats are not interchangeable between different styles of STABILicers.","short_description":"STABILicers anti-skid traction soles give your footwear a tenacious grip on snow and ice.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Footwear Accessories","product_group":"Winter Traction Devices","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s383415.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l383415.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=383415&tt=df","retail_price":"49.95","sale_price":"49.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=383415\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m383415.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=760283&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7602830015":{"sku":"7602830015","upc":"689076932899","size":"XS","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"49.95","sale_price":"49.95"},"7602830023":{"sku":"7602830023","upc":"689076932998","size":"S","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"49.95","sale_price":"49.95"},"7602830056":{"sku":"7602830056","upc":"689076933292","size":"Xl","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"49.95","sale_price":"49.95"}},"categories":["footwear","footwear-accessories","winter-traction-devices"]}
