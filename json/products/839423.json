{"sku":"839423","manufacturer_id":"48371-0105-196","brand_name":"Dynafit","product_name":"Dynafit Huascaran Randonee Skis - 2012/2013","long_description":"Named for the 22,205 ft. peak in Peru, the Dynafit Huascaran skis thrive at high speeds on steep, powder-filled slopes. Ultralight paulownia wood cores keep the skis light and exceptionally smooth on every turn; bamboo stringers increase core strength without adding cumbersome weight. Fiberglass and carbon laminate provides good torsional stiffness and lateral reinforcement without weighing the skis down. Rockered tips allow smooth, predictable turns in all types of snow; rockered tails have a low rise that makes them easy to disengage at the end of a turn. Patented titanal Dynafit Ski Insert System eliminates the need to drill your ski for Dynafit bindings (sold separately) and creates excellent ski-to-binding holding strength. Patented SpeedSkinFix attachment system securely attaches Dynafit skins (sold separately) to skis. SpeedSkinFix system does not interfere with the attachment of other brands of skins that feature a tip loop and tail clip. Dynafit Huascaran skis have a sintered graphite coating on the bases that enhances glide and improves wax retention. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.","short_description":"Named for the 22,205 ft. peak in Peru, the Dynafit Huascaran skis thrive at high speeds on steep, powder-filled slopes.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Backcountry Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s381775.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l381775.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=381775&tt=df","retail_price":"899.95","sale_price":"899.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=381775\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m381775.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=839423&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8394230001":{"sku":"8394230001","vendor_sku":"48371-0105-177","size":"177 CM","color":"WHITE/BLACK/GREEN","retail_price":"899.95","sale_price":"899.95"},"8394230002":{"sku":"8394230002","vendor_sku":"48371-0105-186","size":"186 CM","color":"WHITE/BLACK/GREEN","retail_price":"899.95","sale_price":"899.95"},"8394230003":{"sku":"8394230003","vendor_sku":"48371-0105-196","size":"196 CM","color":"WHITE/BLACK/GREEN","retail_price":"899.95","sale_price":"899.95"}},"categories":["snow","skis","backcountry-skis"]}
