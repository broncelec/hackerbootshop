Twill Pattern Technology (TPT) sheath weave delivers a small profile in the cross-section for improved sharp-edge abrasion resistance and reduced friction through carabiners. Endura Dry(TM) treatment penetrates the sheath and core and bonds with the rope fiber to retard moisture gain and improve abrasion resistance. Sheath pattern changes at the midpoint to ease rope management when climbing and rappelling. 70m length allows for extended leads and rappels on today's modern routes. Kernmantle design features a stretchy core protected by a durable outer sheath which combine for strength and good handling. The New England Alex Honnold Signature 9mm x 70m Dry Rope meets or exceeds UIAA tests for falls, impact force and elongation.","short_description":"The Alex Honnold Signature Glider 9.9mm x 70m Dry Rope is lightweight and has the supple feel that New England ropes are known for, making it your go-to rope for cragging and alpine rock climbing.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Ropes","product_group":"Single Ropes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s356407.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l356407.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=356407&tt=df","keywords":"dynamic","retail_price":"244.00","sale_price":"244.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=356407\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m356407.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=869679&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8696790001":{"sku":"8696790001","vendor_sku":"442H-99-00230","upc":"753963134496","size":"9 MM X 70 M","color":"BLUE/BROWN","retail_price":"244.00","sale_price":"244.00"}},"categories":["climbing","climbing-ropes","single-ropes"]}
