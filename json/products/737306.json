{"sku":"737306","manufacturer_id":"443050","brand_name":"Edelweiss","product_name":" EDELWEISS Discover 8mm x 30m Super Dry Twin Rope","long_description":"The Edelweiss Discover 8mm x 30m Super Dry twin rope is a shorter length rope designed for mountain walking, glacier travel and use during emergencies. Small diameter and dry finish keep the weight down, while its 30m length coils small for easy transport in a pack. Super Everdry(TM) treatment coats both sheath and core fibers to minimize water-absorption. Additional Perdur(TM) sheath fiber coating helps increase abrasion resistance up to 33%. Smooth, tightly braided sheath improves durability, reduces rope drag and allows easier handling. Edelweiss Discover 8mm x 30m Super Dry twin rope meets or exceeds UIAA tests for falls, impact force and elongation. Compact size and dynamic construction can be used singly for mountain and glacier travel as well as backcountry safety.","short_description":"The Edelweiss Discover 8mm x 30m Super Dry twin rope is a shorter length rope designed for mountain walking, glacier travel and use during emergencies.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Ropes","product_group":"Twin Ropes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s180079.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l180079.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=180079&tt=df","keywords":"dynamic","retail_price":"89.95","sale_price":"89.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=180079\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m180079.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=737306&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7373060016":{"sku":"7373060016","vendor_sku":"443050","size":"8 Mm X 30 M","color":"PURPLE","retail_price":"89.95","sale_price":"89.95"}}}
