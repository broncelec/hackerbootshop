Waterproofed nubuck leather and flexible nylon mesh uppers offer ample durability, flexibility and breathability for comfort on the go. KEEN.DRY(TM) waterproof breathable membranes keep feet dry while allowing perspiration to dissipate before it saturates the inside of the shoe. Webbing pull loops at heel and tongue allow easy entry/exit; padded, gusseted tongues keep out debris and moisture while relieving lace pressure. Patented rubber Toe Guards protect feet and uppers from impacts and abrasion. Removable metatomical EVA footbeds are shaped to provide cushioning and arch support; can also accommodate orthotics. Dual-density EVA midsoles supply shock absorption and padding for all-day comfort. Supportive nylon shanks provide torsional stability and protection from uneven terrain. S3 (shock, suspension, stability) drop-in heel inserts support the feet on impact, dissipate shock and help reduce the chance of twisting an ankle. Keen Targhee II women's hiking shoes feature nonmarking rubber outsoles with aggressive 4mm multidirectional lugs for reliable traction. Fit tip: runs about a half size small.
