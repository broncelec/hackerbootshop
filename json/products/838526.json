{"sku":"838526","manufacturer_id":"1206-GOLD-MD","brand_name":"Showers Pass","product_name":" Showers Pass Elite 2.1 Bike Jacket - Men's","long_description":"From organized bike tours to everyday commuting, the Showers Pass Elite 2.1 bike jacket uses eVent(TM) fabric for amazing waterproof, breathable protection. Durable nylon shell features an eVent membrane for waterproof, breathable protection from the elements. eVent fabric has a unique membrane structure that allows sweat vapor to easily escape to the outside of the fabric. Because you remain dry on the inside, the likelihood of an uncomfortable, post-exercise chill is eliminated. 11 in. pit zippers and the 2-way front waterproof zipper allow maximum ventilation. Chest pocket and angled rear stash pockets feature water-resistant zippers to keep contents dry; chest pocket has an internal headphone exit port for an MP3 player. Mesh-lined large back panel vent provides flow-through ventilation; light loop allows you to attach a safety light. For added ventilation, oversize cuffs scoop air up your sleeves; open cuffs sport rip-and-stick tabs to keep wind and rain out. Soft, moisture-wicking tricot lines interior chin guard and inner collar for enhanced comfort. Droptail hem ensures coverage in the riding position. Cinch cords at collar and hem seal in warmth. Abundant reflective taping on arms and back boosts visibility to others. Close-fitting cut of the Showers Pass Elite 2.1 bike jacket aids in warmth without inhibiting movement.","short_description":"From organized bike tours to everyday commuting, the Showers Pass Elite 2.1 bike jacket uses eVent(TM) fabric for amazing waterproof, breathable protection.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Cycling Clothing","product_group":"Cycling Jackets","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s391451.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l391451.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=391451&tt=df","retail_price":"249.00","sale_price":"168.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=391451\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m391451.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=838526&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8385260001":{"sku":"8385260001","vendor_sku":"1206-GOLD-MD","upc":"906223102463","size":"M","color":"GOLDENROD","retail_price":"168.93","sale_price":"168.93"},"8385260002":{"sku":"8385260002","vendor_sku":"1206-GOLD-LG","upc":"906223102470","size":"L","color":"GOLDENROD","retail_price":"168.93","sale_price":"168.93"},"8385260003":{"sku":"8385260003","vendor_sku":"1206-GOLD-XL","upc":"906223102487","size":"XL","color":"GOLDENROD","retail_price":"168.93","sale_price":"168.93"},"8385260004":{"sku":"8385260004","vendor_sku":"1207","upc":"906223102517","size":"M","color":"OCEAN BLUE","retail_price":"168.93","sale_price":"168.93"},"8385260005":{"sku":"8385260005","vendor_sku":"1207","upc":"906223102524","size":"L","color":"OCEAN BLUE","retail_price":"168.93","sale_price":"168.93"},"8385260006":{"sku":"8385260006","vendor_sku":"1207","upc":"906223102531","size":"XL","color":"OCEAN BLUE","retail_price":"168.93","sale_price":"168.93"}}}
