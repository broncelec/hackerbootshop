{"sku":"751540","manufacturer_id":"620002","brand_name":"Black Diamond","product_name":" Black Diamond nForce Ascender","long_description":"With a greater clamping force than conventional ascenders, the Black Diamond nForce ascender offers maximum grip on icy or muddy ropes. Anodized aluminum construction is lightweight, durable and corrosion resistant. Four-bar linkage drives body weight into the rope resulting in nearly a third greater clamping force than standard ascending devices. Flared rope slot fits a wide range of rope diameters, from 8-13mm; stainless-steel cam design can be installed and removed easily mid-rope. Spring-loaded stainless-steel cam opens wide for rope insertion; thumb-controlled lever offers one-thumb operation during ascension. Locking mechanism locks cam in either the open or closed position; engages and disengages with index finger via the cam trigger. Includes upper and lower carabiner clip-in points; thumb bump at top assists when descending short distances. Available in left- and right-handed versions, color-coded for easy recognition. Ergonomic polyethylene-coated grip provides a sure hold, even with heavy gloves; keeps hands from freezing and sticking in cold weather. Can also be used for self-belay or hauling gear.","short_description":"With a greater clamping force than conventional ascenders, the Black Diamond nForce ascender offers maximum grip on icy or muddy ropes.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Hardware","product_group":"Ascenders And Descenders","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s457031.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l457031.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=457031&tt=df","keywords":"rappel,belay","retail_price":"79.95","sale_price":"79.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=457031\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m457031.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=751540&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7515400013":{"sku":"7515400013","vendor_sku":"620002","upc":"793661089254","color":"LEFT","retail_price":"79.95","sale_price":"79.95"},"7515400021":{"sku":"7515400021","vendor_sku":"620001","upc":"793661089247","color":"RIGHT","retail_price":"79.95","sale_price":"79.95"}},"categories":["climbing","climbing-hardware","ascenders-and-descenders"]}
