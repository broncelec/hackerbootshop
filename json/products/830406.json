{"sku":"830406","manufacturer_id":"53377","brand_name":"Camelbak","product_name":"CamelBak eddy Insulated Water Bottle - 20 fl. oz.","long_description":"Keep your beverages cool for hours on end in the sleek and clean CamelBak eddy(TM) insulated water bottle. Double-wall bottle features vacuum insulation to keep your drink cool all afternoon; insulation keeps condensation from forming on the outside of the bottle. Made of Eastman Tritan(TM) copolyester, the bottle is completely BPA-free and is dishwasher safe. Tritan copolyester provides excellent impact resistance and is suitable for both warm and cold beverages. CamelBak Big Bite valve eliminates awkward drips and spills; just bite and sip and the beverage flows through the valve-you don't even need to tip the bottle to drink. But if lifting and tipping is your preferred method, no problem; just remove the straw inside, tip and sip. Big Bite valve has an articulating stem, so when not in use it folds down next to the bottle and stays clean. Carry the integrated handle in the crook of a finger, or connect it to a pack or waistbelt with a small carabiner (sold separately). Simply unscrew the cap to uncover bottle's wide-mouth opening for easy filling and cleaning; opening is compatible with standard 63mm caps, filters and accessories. Specially shaped bottle fits nicely in your hand and in most automobile cup holders. CamelBak eddy Insulated water bottle is not intended for use with hot liquids or carbonated beverages.","short_description":"Keep your beverages cool for hours on end in the sleek and clean CamelBak eddy(TM) insulated water bottle.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Water Bottles And Treatment","product_group":"Water Bottles, Flasks And Jugs","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s425623.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l425623.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=425623&tt=df","retail_price":"20.00","sale_price":"20.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=425623\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m425623.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=830406&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8304060002":{"sku":"8304060002","vendor_sku":"53377","upc":"886798533773","color":"COBALT","retail_price":"20.00","sale_price":"20.00"},"8304060003":{"sku":"8304060003","vendor_sku":"53380","upc":"886798533803","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"20.00","sale_price":"20.00"},"8304060004":{"sku":"8304060004","vendor_sku":"53541","upc":"886798535418","color":"JADE","retail_price":"20.00","sale_price":"20.00"},"8304060005":{"sku":"8304060005","vendor_sku":"53558","upc":"886798535586","color":"LAVENDER/LAVENDER","retail_price":"20.00","sale_price":"20.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","water-bottles-and-treatment","water-bottles-flasks-and-jugs"]}
