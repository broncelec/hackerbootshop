{"sku":"858172","manufacturer_id":"8A311200001","brand_name":"Blizzard","product_name":"Blizzard Cochise Skis - Men's - 2013-2014","long_description":"The Blizzard Cochise skis float high in powder and bust through windblown crud with their stable 108mm waists and naturally rockered tips and tails designed for maneuvering in soft snow. Blizzard builds the rocker without bending the core, creating a naturally flexing, responsive ski that turns easily, resists high-speed chatter and shreds crud and pow. Light camber underfoot assists with grip on hardpack. Wood core is constructed like a sandwich with layers of precisely-milled strips reinforcing each other to create a lightweight, snappy ski with smooth and easy handling. A dual titanium laminate increases stiffness during the turn, adding power that aggressive skiers will love. Sidewalls direct power right to the edges of the skis, resulting in quick side-to-side response. 108mm waists require bindings with wide brakes.","short_description":"The Blizzard Cochise skis float high in powder and bust through windblown crud with their stable 108mm waists and naturally rockered tips and tails designed for maneuvering in soft snow.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s442427.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l442427.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=442427&tt=df","retail_price":"749.95","sale_price":"524.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=442427\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m442427.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=858172&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8581720001":{"sku":"8581720001","vendor_sku":"8A311200001","upc":"885315549204","size":"177 CM","color":"BLUE/RED","retail_price":"524.83","sale_price":"524.83"},"8581720002":{"sku":"8581720002","vendor_sku":"8A311200001","upc":"885315549211","size":"185 CM","color":"BLUE/RED","retail_price":"524.83","sale_price":"524.83"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
