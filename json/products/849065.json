{"sku":"849065","manufacturer_id":"EPDT700","brand_name":"Shimano","product_name":" Shimano Click'R PD-T700 Bike Pedals","long_description":"Shimano Click'R PD-T700 bike pedals offer an easy-to-use clipless option for those wanting to try clipless pedals for the first time. They're also great for recreational riding or weekend touring. At the heart of the Click'R design is a light, easy-to-engage cleat spring that makes it quick and simple to clip in and clip out of the pedals. Reduced effort offers the efficiencies of a clipless system with little fuss-put a foot down fast for unexpected stops or step in casually when you're ready to roll. Plus, the amount of heel twist required to disengage is less than other clipless pedals, so you pop out of the pedals easier and sooner. Pedals feature the convenience of dual-side entry; pop-up cages within the pedals grab cleats for fast, easy engagement. Spring tension can be adjusted to your preference. Integrated reflectors are built into the pedal body platforms for enhanced visibility. Chromoly steel spindles and sealed cartridge bearings ensure smooth, long-lasting spinning. SPD cleats are included with the Shimano Click'R PD-T700 bike pedals; please note that the SPD cleats will only work with 2-hole SPD-compatible shoes.","short_description":"Shimano Click'R PD-T700 bike pedals offer an easy-to-use clipless option for those wanting to try clipless pedals for the first time.
