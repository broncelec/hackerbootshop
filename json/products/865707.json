{"sku":"865707","manufacturer_id":"234197-008","brand_name":"Scott","product_name":"Scott Contessa Scale 730 27.5 Women's Bike - 2014","long_description":"The women's Scott Contessa Scale 730 27.5 is a comfortable bike that's well-suited to novice and budget-conscious mountain bikers who want the easy roll-over and increased speed of 27.5 in. wheels. The Contessa Scale 730 is quicker and lighter than 29ers, but offers the same benefits of large-diameter wheels-more speed and better traction. Compared to 26 in. wheels, larger-diameter wheels roll over obstacles more easily so you won't stall going uphill over roots and loose soil. Aluminum frame geometry is designed specifically for women, creating a more comfortable ride compared to unisex frames. SR Suntour XCR-LO suspension fork offers a plush 100mm of travel and easy lockout; springs have been optimized to deliver responsive performance for lighter riders. Shimano shifters and derailleurs provide dependable shifting performance through the 27 gear combinations. Shimano hydraulic disc brakes supply powerful, responsive braking in all conditions. Sturdy rims are outfitted with Impac Ridgepac tires for all-terrain handling and traction. Contessa Active saddle is ergonomically designed for women.
