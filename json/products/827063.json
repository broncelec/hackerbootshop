{"sku":"827063","manufacturer_id":"13546","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":"REI Flash 62 Pack - Men's","long_description":"The updated REI Flash 62 pack sports a redesigned frame, hipbelt and back panel, combining ultralight materials with the comfort and performance you'd expect from a heavier pack. Superior load transfer and stability allows you to comfortably carry hefty loads; it's achieved with a new perimeter frame and structured hipbelt, all with no added weight. Precurved shoulder straps match your anatomy for nonbinding comfort and stability; perforated foam allows body vapor to pass through for improved comfort. Updated, fully structured hipbelt cradles the hips for a natural fit and offers impressive comfort and load transfer for an ultralight pack. Hipbelt webbing system lets you use a natural forward pulling motion for quick, easy cinching and precise adjustment. New molded, mesh-covered EVA back panel offers comfortable, ventilating performance that rivals heavier packs. New tubular aluminum perimeter frame provides excellent load support and stability while minimizing weight. Top-loading main compartment can also be accessed from a zippered opening at the bottom; floating top lid can be extended to create additional volume. Hydration pocket holds a reservoir of your choice (sold separately) for drinking water on the go. Floating front pocket maintains volume even when the main compartment is fully loaded; it offers convenient storage and allows more compressible gear to be stored behind it. Large mesh side pockets hold items for quick access. Hipbelt has zippered pockets on both sides for on-the-go access to essentials such as snacks and lip balm. Water-resistant zippers let you stash valuables away from the elements. Lightweight Speed Hook attachment points let you strap tools and bulky gear to the pack; quick-release straps at the bottom offer easy attachment of a sleeping bag or pad. Side compression straps help secure both large and small loads for increased stability.","short_description":"The updated REI Flash 62 pack sports a redesigned frame, hipbelt and back panel, combining ultralight materials with the comfort and performance you'd expect from a heavier pack.","category":"Camping & Hiking","subcategory":"Backpacking Packs","product_group":"Multi-Day Backpacks","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s234003.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l234003.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=234003&tt=df","keywords":"lightweight,adult","retail_price":"189.00","sale_price":"93.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=234003\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m234003.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=827063&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8270630002":{"sku":"8270630002","vendor_sku":"13546","upc":"482706300026","size":"M","color":"OLIVE OIL/PORPOISE","retail_price":"93.83","sale_price":"93.83"},"8270630003":{"sku":"8270630003","vendor_sku":"13546","upc":"482706300033","size":"L","color":"OLIVE OIL/PORPOISE","retail_price":"93.83","sale_price":"93.83"}}}
