{"sku":"859530","manufacturer_id":"A130300301185","brand_name":"Line","product_name":" Line Blend Skis - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Melding freestyle trick-ready features with big-mountain construction, the Line Blend skis are designed for those who roam all terrain from the park to the backcountry for a fresh powder fix. Twin-tip design provides freestyle performance on all terrain, and symmetrical flex pattern in tips and tails creates identical responsiveness whether skiing forward or switch. Tip and tail rocker floats high in powder whether skiing forward or switch; relatively low rise planes through powder instead of plowing up and over. Core consists of light and strong maple wood stringers surrounded by aspen wood to provide power, stability and long-lasting responsiveness. Widest points of the tips and tails are close to the center of the skis, reducing tail drag and hooking in powder. Cap construction on top of skis blends light responsiveness with the durability and solid feel of sidewalls. Geometry of skis incorporates 5 different turn radii to create effortless turn initiation with solid edge hold and responsive exits. Thin cores and sidewalls in the tips reduce weight and make the skis easier to control. Line Blend skis feature 100mm waists that require bindings with wide brakes. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.","short_description":"Melding freestyle trick-ready features with big-mountain construction, the Line Blend skis are designed for those who roam all terrain from the park to the backcountry for a fresh powder fix.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382179.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382179.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382179&tt=df","retail_price":"599.95","sale_price":"359.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382179\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382179.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859530&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8595300001":{"sku":"8595300001","vendor_sku":"A130300301171","upc":"886745207214","size":"171 CM","retail_price":"359.93","sale_price":"359.93"},"8595300002":{"sku":"8595300002","vendor_sku":"A130300301178","upc":"886745207238","size":"178 CM","retail_price":"359.93","sale_price":"359.93"},"8595300003":{"sku":"8595300003","vendor_sku":"A130300301185","upc":"886745207252","size":"185 CM","retail_price":"359.93","sale_price":"359.93"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
