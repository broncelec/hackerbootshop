Osprey Hydraulics(TM) system sandwiches an anatomically shaped plastic sheet between a layer of nylon fabric and the reservoir back.

HydraForm(TM) reservoir features a rigid spine/handle that stabilizes the water load and makes it easy to slide the reservoir into the pack. Zippered hydration sleeve is easy to access. Rigid spine/handle and large mouth make filling and cleaning the reservoir a snap. BPA- and PVC-free reservoir does not retain tastes or odors and features AquaGuard(TM) antimicrobial formula to help prevent bacteria and mold. 180deg pivoting on/off valve rotates in either direction for quick and easy flow control; magnetic sternum-strap buckle secures the bite valve when not in use. AirSpeed(TM) suspension incorporates a lightweight alloy frame and cross struts with a tensioned mesh back panel for support and flexibility. Biostretch(TM) harness is ventilated for cooling comfort; full hipbelt adds stability and load transfer. Panel-loading main compartment is spacious enough for a long day's worth of food, clothing and gear. Zippered top organizational pocket with key clip holds small items; zippered top pocket with soft lining helps keep sunglasses or other fragile items from getting scratched. Stretch-woven front shove-it pocket offers quick external storage and access; integrated patch holds a blinker light (sold separately).
