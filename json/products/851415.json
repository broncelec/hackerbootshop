With amazing stability, traction and cushioning, you'll enjoy lasting comfort, mile after mile. Closed polyester mesh uppers feature flexible thermoplastic urethene and polyurethane reinforcements for lightweight support. Single-pull lacing for easy on and off. Polyester linings wick moisture away from feet for extended comfort. Lightweight microfiber tongues offer a slim, foot-conforming fit for amazing comfort. EVA midsoles feature foam that is 30% softer than traditional running shoe foam, and 2.5 times more voluminous; this extra cushioning dissipates shock from heel striking. Midsoles allow for as much as 20mm of compression in the heel. 4mm heel-to-toe drop and rockered profile create a rolling motion that encourages proper forward motion. Wide outsole platforms on the Hoka One One Stinson Evo trail-running shoes provide a stable base. Sticky rubber outsoles grip wet and dry surfaces with ease; soles feature small interior lugs and larger outside lugs for enhanced flexibility and nimble movement.","short_description":"Take your trail running to the next level with the Hoka One One Stinson Evo trail-running shoes.
