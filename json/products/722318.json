{"sku":"722318","manufacturer_id":"118 352 502","brand_name":"Native Eyewear","product_name":" Native Eyewear Hardtop Polarized Sunglasses - Men's","long_description":"Native's most technically advanced sunglasses! Polarized for sun and glare protection, two pairs of lenses and an interchangeable sports band! A unique interchangeable lens system lets you switch lenses without having to put your fingers all over them. Polarized Crystal Carbonate(R) lenses have the strongest hard coating available to protect against scratching. Rhyno-Tuff(R) AIR frames endure extreme highs and lows in temperature. Cam-action spring hinges allow the temples to quickly lock into position. P.C.C.(R) lenses pass the rigorous ANSI Z80.3 tests for optical clarity and impact resistance while blocking 100% of harmful UVA and UVB light. Self-adjusting Cushinol(TM) nosepads and ear stems create a nonslip grip that keeps sunglasses in place, ensuring a soft feel and personalized fit. Venting system incorporated into the frames enhances airflow and virtually eliminates fog and condensation. Each frame includes one set of polarized lens (tint depends on frame color) and one set of SportFlex(TM) lenses, for a total of two sets of lenses. Additional SportFlex orange-yellow lenses have a blue mirror coating suitable for a range of low-light conditions from cloudy, overcast, dusk and dawn. Best fits a medium to a large profile. Also included is an Optic Gear Kit that features a semi-rigid zippered case and a soft pouch that doubles as a cleaning cloth.","short_description":"Native's most technically advanced sunglasses!
