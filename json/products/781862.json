{"sku":"781862","manufacturer_id":"SG 2 F11 240","brand_name":"Werner","product_name":" Werner Skagit Paddle","long_description":"The Skagit paddle from Werner offers beginning and recreational paddlers excellent value and performance. Carbon and fiberglass shaft feels comfortable to the touch; durable construction stands up to long hours on the water. Adjustable Ferrule System allows elegant adjustment of feathering angle from 0deg - 60deg right or left in 15deg increments. Improved ferrule design incorporates internal printing of offset degrees and a low-profile button release that makes paddle feel like 1 piece. Injection-molded blades are constructed with fiberglass-reinforced nylon, offering a lighter swing weight than plastic blades. Asymmetrical blade shape helps reduce torque, allowing paddle to pull smoothly through the water and reducing the need to grip tightly. Drip rings help keep hands and lap dry. Design is optimized for low-angle paddling style. 2-piece design breaks down quickly and eases transport and storage.","short_description":"The Skagit paddle from Werner offers beginning and recreational paddlers excellent value and performance.","category":"Paddling","subcategory":"Paddles","product_group":"Kayak Paddles","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s430983.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l430983.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=430983&tt=df","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=430983\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m430983.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=781862&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7818620010":{"sku":"7818620010","vendor_sku":"SG 2 F11 220","upc":"478186200109","size":"220 Cm","color":"YELLOW","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"},"7818620028":{"sku":"7818620028","vendor_sku":"SG 2 F11 230","upc":"840463108185","size":"230 Cm","color":"YELLOW","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"},"7818620036":{"sku":"7818620036","vendor_sku":"SG 2 F11 240","upc":"840463108208","size":"240 Cm","color":"YELLOW","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"}},"categories":["paddling","paddles","kayak-paddles"]}
