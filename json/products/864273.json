Polarchromic lenses automatically adjust tint according to light conditions; lenses are perfect for high altitude and open water environments. Copper-tint lenses maximize colors and depth perception while reducing glare; polarized lenses reduce 99% of visible glare for increased sharpness and decreased eye fatigue. Lightweight Techlite(TM) lenses feature high-quality borosilicate glass that is polished and chemically tempered for increased shatter resistance. 53% bio-based Evolve frames are made with Rilsan(R) Clear, a light, durable, non-petroleum-based material derived from renewable, non-GMO castor plants. Hydrophilic Megol nosepiece and temple ends become tackier when wet for reliable grip during exercise and hot weather. The Smith Touchstone Polorchromic sunglasses have a medium fit with large coverage.","short_description":"With advanced light-reactive technology, the stylish Smith Touchstone Polorchromic sunglasses adapt to changing light levels, fine-tuning the tint to meet your needs on the go.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sunglasses","product_group":"Sport Sunglasses","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s456023.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l456023.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=456023&tt=df","keywords":"Cycling","retail_price":"199.00","sale_price":"199.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=456023\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m456023.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=864273&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8642730001":{"sku":"8642730001","vendor_sku":"TSGPPCPMH","upc":"715757333034","size":"POLARCHROMIC COPPER","color":"MAHOGANY","retail_price":"199.00","sale_price":"199.00"}}}
