Ange L Wiregate carabiner weighs only 34g yet has a gate open clearance of 26mm to make clipping ropes and protection simple. Straight keylock nose lets you clip and unclip slings, bolt hangers, nuts and cams without snagging; hole in the nose allows ice, snow and dirt to be cleared out. Surfaces that come into contact with the climbing rope are wider than other parts of the carabiner for smooth passage of the rope and reduced wear on the 'biner. Indent at the bottom of the Petzl Ange L wiregate carabiner keeps a sling properly positioned. Black deflector at the bottom of the gate works with the shape of the carabiner to keep proper position of the 'biner on its major axis.","short_description":"The standard-size Petzl Ange L carabiner features the MonoFil Keylock wiregate system that combines the fluidity of a spring gate with the lightness of a wiregate for easy clipping.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Hardware","product_group":"Carabiners","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s376031.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l376031.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=376031&tt=df","retail_price":"11.95","sale_price":"11.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=376031\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m376031.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=830897&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8308970001":{"sku":"8308970001","vendor_sku":"M59 G","color":"GRAY","retail_price":"11.95","sale_price":"11.95"},"8308970002":{"sku":"8308970002","vendor_sku":"M59 B","color":"BLUE","retail_price":"11.95","sale_price":"11.95"}},"categories":["climbing","climbing-hardware","carabiners"]}
