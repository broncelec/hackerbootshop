{"sku":"837862","manufacturer_id":"14081","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":"REI Side Country 19 Snow Pack","long_description":"With the sleek REI Side Country 19 snow pack, you can get away from the tracked-out runs and access the best parts of the mountain. Perfect for a day at the resort, the REI Side Country 19 offers enough room for safety equipment, snacks and an extra layer. Tarpaulin interior resists moisture and abrasion. Front zippered pocket is sized for a shovel blade, and features a sleeve for the handle. Back panel material sheds snow and dries quickly. Skis carry diagonally across the front of the pack, and snowboards and snowshoes carry vertically down the center; straps tuck away. Padded front panel and tough reinforcement patches prevent damage from skis and snowboards. Clip on top of pack provides a place to attach your helmet and keep it out of the way while climbing. Hydration pocket is designed to accept most hydration reservoirs, reservoir not included. Insulated sleeve on shoulder strap stores the hydration hose to help prevent freeze-up and is large enough to accommodate right-angle shut-off valves. Hipbelt snugs comfortably to help distribute weight to your hips, not your back. Hipbelt webbing system adjusts with a forward pull, creating a secure, ergonomic fit. Snow-specific buckles are designed to work well with gloves on and to prevent clogging with snow.","short_description":"With the sleek REI Side Country 19 snow pack, you can get away from the tracked-out runs and access the best parts of the mountain.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Packs And Bags","product_group":"Ski Packs","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s254303.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l254303.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=254303&tt=df","keywords":"day packs","retail_price":"74.50","sale_price":"29.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=254303\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m254303.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=837862&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8378620001":{"sku":"8378620001","vendor_sku":"14081","upc":"483786200015","color":"CORINTHIAN BLUE","retail_price":"29.83","sale_price":"29.83"}}}
