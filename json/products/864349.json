{"sku":"864349","manufacturer_id":"51008","brand_name":"Helly Hansen","product_name":"Helly Hansen H2 Flow Jacket - Men's","long_description":"Professional skiers and climbers love the innovative airflow system of the men's Helly Hansen H2 Flow Jacket. Its perforated fleece lining retains heat when you want it, vents it when you don't. The \"H2\" in the name stands for heat and hollow, because the Polartec(R) fleece offers warmth yet has air pocket \"hollows\" to release heat and let in air as you work hard. 200g Polartec brushed fleece lines the main body and is soft and warm. Sleeves are lined with lightweight tricot for ease of movement; collar is lined with brushed tricot for comfort against the skin. Polyester shell fabric locks heat inside the air pockets. Open mesh inside allows air to flow between the air pockets and your body during intense activity. Front chest vents zip open to let you increase air flow, zip closed to retain more heat. Helly Hansen H2 Flow Jacket for men offers zippered hand pockets, lightweight warmth and superb ventilation.","short_description":"Professional skiers and climbers love the innovative airflow system of the men's Helly Hansen H2 Flow Jacket.
