{"sku":"854577","manufacturer_id":"31677","brand_name":"Patagonia","product_name":"Patagonia Snowbelle 3-in-1 Insulated Jacket - Women's","long_description":"Versatility at its best, the Patagonia 3-in-1 Snowbelle insulated jacket boasts waterproof protection and a zip-out insulated liner for easy, season-long wear that caters to your needs. 3 different ways to wear the system: wear shell jacket and liner jacket together for maximum protection or wear either piece on its own as weather warrants. 2-layer H2No(R) construction boasts a polyester shell backed with a waterproof, breathable laminate to deliver all-weather protection. Durable Water Repellent finish causes water to bead up and roll off, fending off light rain showers and snow. Embedded RECCO(R) reflector enhances radio signals from search-and-rescue RECCO detectors, helping speed up the search for a buried avalanche victim. Polyester mesh lining helps to moves moisture away from your body for a dry fit; pit zips let you quickly release heat. Adjustable powder skirt helps seal out snow; webbing loops connect to any Patagonia snow pants (sold separately). Removable, 2-way adjustable hood is helmet-compatible and has a stiff visor for optimal visibility in poor conditions. Hem of the Patagonia 3-in-1 Snowbelle insulated jacket cinches to keep chill out; pleated gusset at cuffs fits over or under your gloves to prevent snow from sneaking in. Removable liner jacket features Thermogreen insulation (90% recycled content) that stays warm even when wet; liner jacket is also treated with a Durable Water Repellent finish.","short_description":"Versatility at its best, the Patagonia 3-in-1 Snowbelle insulated jacket boasts waterproof protection and a zip-out insulated liner for easy, season-long wear that caters to your needs.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Women's Ski Clothing","product_group":"Women's Insulated Ski Jackets","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s338143.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l338143.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=338143&tt=df","keywords":"hardshell,jacket,insulated","retail_price":"399.00","sale_price":"279.99","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=338143\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m338143.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=854577&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8545770002":{"sku":"8545770002","vendor_sku":"31677","upc":"887187256068","size":"S","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"279.99","sale_price":"279.99"},"8545770004":{"sku":"8545770004","vendor_sku":"31677","upc":"887187256105","size":"L","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"279.99","sale_price":"279.99"}}}
