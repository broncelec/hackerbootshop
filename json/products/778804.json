{"sku":"778804","manufacturer_id":"IRDM662SGS","brand_name":"Shimano","product_name":" Shimano SLX M662 9-Speed Rear Derailleur","long_description":"SLX M662 is a 9-speed, top-normal rear derailleur that features Shimano Shadow RD design for superior trail clearance and crisp shifting. Shadow RD design is intended for aggressive riding; a low profile and single-tension construction prevent the derailleur from hitting the chainstay in rough riding conditions. The result is smooth, silent performance and increased shifting durability. Straight cable design ensures crisp and accurate shifting. Strong guide spring prevents chainstay contact. 11-tooth pulleys run quieter and wear longer than typical derailleurs thanks to alternating tooth contact between inner and outer chain plates. Fluorine-coated 2-pin bushings reduce link-pin friction resulting in reduced shifting effort.","short_description":"SLX M662 is a 9-speed, top-normal rear derailleur that features Shimano Shadow RD design for superior trail clearance and crisp shifting.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Components","product_group":"Drivetrain Components","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s389995.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l389995.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=389995&tt=df","retail_price":"70.00","sale_price":"70.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=389995\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m389995.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=778804&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7788040017":{"sku":"7788040017","vendor_sku":"IRDM662SGS","upc":"689228245402","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"70.00","sale_price":"70.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-components","drivetrain-components"]}
