{"sku":"866752","manufacturer_id":"14K0401","brand_name":"Vibram","product_name":" Vibram Alitza Shoes - Girls'","long_description":"Giving the same ground feedback and barefoot-like experience you would expect from Vibram, the girls' Fivefingers(R) Alitza Shoes add a fashionable look with flexible straps. The Alitza is a practical option for multiple activities, including barefoot running, light trekking, water sports and general fitness. With the open top design, the kids' Alitza is easy to get on and off; top straps aid functionality and enhance the natural curves of the foot. Individual toe slots enhance dexterity, control and stability to help deliver a natural motion. 5.5mm Vibram outsoles are made of nonmarking Vibram XS Trek rubber and feature traction pods that follow the contours of your feet and toes for enhanced traction. Antimicrobial treatment helps control odor development. Machine wash, air dry. In order to allow kids' feet to adapt to using different muscles, gradually increase usage of these shoes over time. To determine size, stand with heels against a wall and measure from the wall to the tip of the longest toe; use the longest toe length in conjunction with the size chart. Vibram FiveFingers Alitza Shoes are vegan-friendly.","short_description":"Giving the same ground feedback and barefoot-like experience you would expect from Vibram, the girls' Fivefingers(R) Alitza Shoes add a fashionable look with flexible straps.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Kids' Footwear","product_group":"Kids' Shoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s443087.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l443087.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=443087&tt=df","retail_price":"60.00","sale_price":"60.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=443087\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m443087.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=866752&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8667520001":{"sku":"8667520001","vendor_sku":"14K0401","upc":"847100040303","size":"30","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"60.00","sale_price":"60.00"},"8667520002":{"sku":"8667520002","vendor_sku":"14K0401","upc":"847100040297","size":"31","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"60.00","sale_price":"60.00"},"8667520003":{"sku":"8667520003","vendor_sku":"14K0401","upc":"847100040280","size":"32","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"60.00","sale_price":"60.00"},"8667520004":{"sku":"8667520004","vendor_sku":"14K0401","upc":"847100040389","size":"33","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"60.00","sale_price":"60.00"},"8667520005":{"sku":"8667520005","vendor_sku":"14K0401","upc":"847100040570","size":"34","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"60.00","sale_price":"60.00"},"8667520006":{"sku":"8667520006","vendor_sku":"14K0401","upc":"847100040792","size":"35","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"60.00","sale_price":"60.00"},"8667520007":{"sku":"8667520007","vendor_sku":"14K0401","upc":"847100040808","size":"36","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"60.00","sale_price":"60.00"},"8667520010":{"sku":"8667520010","vendor_sku":"14K0402","upc":"847100040846","size":"32","color":"PURPLE/RED","retail_price":"60.00","sale_price":"60.00"},"8667520011":{"sku":"8667520011","vendor_sku":"14K0402","upc":"847100040860","size":"33","color":"PURPLE/RED","retail_price":"60.00","sale_price":"60.00"},"8667520012":{"sku":"8667520012","vendor_sku":"14K0402","upc":"847100040891","size":"34","color":"PURPLE/RED","retail_price":"60.00","sale_price":"60.00"},"8667520013":{"sku":"8667520013","vendor_sku":"14K0402","upc":"847100040907","size":"35","color":"PURPLE/RED","retail_price":"60.00","sale_price":"60.00"},"8667520014":{"sku":"8667520014","vendor_sku":"14K0402","upc":"847100040914","size":"36","color":"PURPLE/RED","retail_price":"60.00","sale_price":"60.00"}},"categories":["footwear","kids-footwear","kids-shoes"]}
