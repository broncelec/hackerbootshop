{"sku":"851522","manufacturer_id":"9042","brand_name":"Thule","product_name":"Thule Helium Aero 2 Bike Hitch Rack","long_description":"The Thule Helium Aero 2 bike hitch rack carries up to 2 bikes and features an ultra-lightweight aluminum construction that's easy to handle when installing and removing. Sleek aero design improves ground clearance and increases distance between bikes for protection. Tilt-down design with Hitch Switch(TM) quick-release lever allows arms to fold down when not in use and tilts carrier away from vehicle for fast rear vehicle access. Included Snug-Tite(TM) Stinger receiver lock secures your rack to the car receiver; 4 walls of fastening contact within receiver eliminate vertical and horizontal movement. Hold Fast Cradles(TM) are shaped to cushion bike frames and feature Thermal Plastic Elastomer road damping pads that absorb road forces and vibration to protect bikes. Anti-Sway Cages with integrated soft-touch TPE strips protect bike frame finishes and prevent bike-to-bike and bike-to-vehicle contact; reinforced rubber cradle straps. Thule Helium Aero accommodates both 2 in. and 1.25 in. receiver hitches with included hitch adapter. Integrated locking cable secures bikes and stores conveniently in the rack's support arms. Easy mounting of hitch rack requires no tools; push rack into receiver until auto-pin engages, tighten knob and lock the hood of the housing. Not intended for tandem or recumbent bikes; carrying bikes with step-through frames requires the purchase of an adapter (sold separately).","short_description":"The Thule Helium Aero 2 bike hitch rack carries up to 2 bikes and features an ultra-lightweight aluminum construction that's easy to handle when installing and removing.","category":"Car Racks","subcategory":"Bike Racks","product_group":"Trailer Hitch Bike Racks","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s305271.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l305271.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=305271&tt=df","keywords":"hitch-mount,mount,rear","retail_price":"349.95","sale_price":"349.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=305271\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m305271.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=851522&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8515220001":{"sku":"8515220001","vendor_sku":"9042","upc":"091021722460","retail_price":"349.95","sale_price":"349.95"}},"categories":["car-racks","bike-racks","trailer-hitch-bike-racks"]}
