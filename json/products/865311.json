{"sku":"865311","manufacturer_id":"40151414","brand_name":"Sierra Designs","product_name":"Sierra Designs Flashlight 2 Tent","long_description":"The 3-season Sierra Designs Flashlight 2 Tent is a 2-person backpacking tent for those who believe that comfort and simplicity shouldn't be mutually exclusive. Hybrid double/single wall design reduces weight and helps ensure quick, dry setup. Leave the tent poles behind and use trekking poles (sold separately) instead to reduce weight. 2 large doors offer both occupants individual access; they create an open, airy feel and allow effective cross-ventilation to control condensation. Awnings with 8-in. overhangs provide dry entry and exit as well as shade from the sun; they let you leave the doors or windows open, even when it's raining. Gear closet lets you store gear where it should be-away from the door; it can be closed or left open for additional venting. With only 6 stakeout points, Sierra Designs Flashlight 2 Tent boasts easy setup and eliminates having to stake it again like most tarp tents and trekking pole shelters require.","short_description":"The 3-season Sierra Designs Flashlight 2 Tent is a 2-person backpacking tent for those who believe that comfort and simplicity shouldn't be mutually exclusive.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Tents","product_group":"Backpacking Tents","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s424111.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l424111.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=424111&tt=df","retail_price":"259.95","sale_price":"259.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=424111\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m424111.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=865311&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8653110001":{"sku":"8653110001","vendor_sku":"40151414","upc":"054003745062","color":"SD TAN/SD BLUE","retail_price":"259.95","sale_price":"259.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","tents","backpacking-tents"]}
