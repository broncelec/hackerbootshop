{"sku":"845491","manufacturer_id":"A2UFD2E","brand_name":"The North Face","product_name":"The North Face Mica FL 2 Tent","long_description":"The North Face Mica FL 2 tent is an ultralight, 2-person tent with generous headroom. It also has an easy-access side door with a dry entry and nice size vestibule to store gear. No-see-um mesh canopy facilitates warm-weather comfort and breathability; asymmetric floor adds extra width at one end for head and shoulder room. Crossing ridge pole maximizes interior volume and provides a dry entrance. Hubbed poleset and color-coded webbing make setup quick and easy. Lightweight and strong DAC Featherlite(R) NSL poles with press-fit connectors use an anodization process that lessens environmental impact. Twist-clips make pitching and disassembly easy and fast, and save weight. High-low ventilation design harnesses convection and cross flow to help expel moisture vapor and prevent interior condensation. Superlight silicone- and polyurethane-coated high-tenacity nylon rainfly material is rugged and weatherproof; fully taped bathtub floor prevents leaks through seams. Adjustable vestibule stakeout ensures a taut pitch and maximizes space. Convenient side pockets stow headlamps and fragile items; also features abundant gear loops. Reflective guyline loops, guylines and glow-in-the-dark zipper pulls make life easier at night. As a convenient option, poles and rainfly can be set up with the footprint (sold separately) to create a lightweight shelter. The North Face Mica 2 tent comes with stuff sacks, DAC tent stakes and guyline/tighteners.","short_description":"The North Face Mica FL 2 tent is an ultralight, 2-person tent with generous headroom.
