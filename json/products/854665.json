{"sku":"854665","manufacturer_id":"A7ZPA5L","brand_name":"The North Face","product_name":"The North Face The North Face ThermoBall Vest - Women's","long_description":"The North Face ThermoBall(TM) vest for women puts revolutionary new ThermoBall(TM) synthetic insulation to work. Warm and light, it mimics down, yet still insulates even when wet. Functioning like down feathers, the tiny round clusters of ThermoBall spun polyester trap warm air, while softly conforming to your body's shape. ThermoBall retains 80% of its insulating power even when dampened by rain, humidity or sweat, so you'll continue to stay warm. Small baffles in shell fabric allow insulation to fully expand to retain body heat; highly compressible ThermoBall insulation offers warmth equal to 600-fill-power goose down. Nylon taffeta shell features diamond stitching that helps hold insulation in place to keep it evenly distributed; Durable Water Repellent finish repels light moisture. Nylon taffeta lining wicks sweat off the skin for quick evaporation, helping you stay dry and comfortable. Quickly stuff the vest into its own space-saving, left-hand stow pocket for compact storage. The North Face ThermoBall vest for women features zippered hand pockets, elastic arm-hole bindings, drawcord hem and a reflective zipper pull.","short_description":"The North Face ThermoBall(TM) vest for women puts revolutionary new ThermoBall(TM) synthetic insulation to work.
