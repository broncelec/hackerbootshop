{"sku":"859873","manufacturer_id":"RBC3110","brand_name":"Rossignol","product_name":"Rossignol Alltrack 120 Ski Boots - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Combining excellent downhill performance with a ski/hike lever to make climbing easy, the intermediate-level Rossignol Alltrack 120 ski boots are stiff but roomy for skiing the sidecountry in comfort. Ski/hike mode uses a specialized technology to create a large range of motion in shells for hiking uphill and walking to and from lifts. Roomy 102mm footbeds offer excellent comfort so you can ski all day long. Grid pattern on shells improves fit, maintains powerful responsiveness and shaves off extra weight to make the boots lighter and easier to ski. An insert made of more flexible material is included at the instep, making it easier to pull the boot on and off. Newly designed liners comfortably wrap feet with excellent support and include Thinsulate(TM) insulation to boost warmth and make happy feet. The Rossignol Alltrack 120 ski boots offer a stiff flex index of 120 that provides a responsive power transfer suited to aggressive intermediate skiers. Optional rockered soles for AT bindings are sold separately.","short_description":"Combining excellent downhill performance with a ski/hike lever to make climbing easy, the intermediate-level Rossignol Alltrack 120 ski boots are stiff but roomy for skiing the sidecountry in comfort.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Downhill Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382647.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382647.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382647&tt=df","retail_price":"549.95","sale_price":"549.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382647\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382647.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859873&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8598730001":{"sku":"8598730001","vendor_sku":"RBC3110","size":"Mondo 26.5","color":"ANTHRACITE/GREEN","retail_price":"549.95","sale_price":"549.95"},"8598730004":{"sku":"8598730004","vendor_sku":"RBC3110","size":"Mondo 29.5","color":"ANTHRACITE/GREEN","retail_price":"549.95","sale_price":"549.95"}},"categories":["snow","ski-boots","downhill-ski-boots"]}
