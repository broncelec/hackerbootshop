{"sku":"846524","manufacturer_id":"55145136S","brand_name":"Outdoor Research","product_name":"Outdoor Research Axiom Rain Jacket - Men's","long_description":"Innovative, lightweight and extremely breathable, the Outdoor Research Axiom storm-shell jacket is engineered for fast and light alpine climbs and all-day lapping of untracked slopes. The Axiom excels during highly aerobic ascent in rugged conditions; even after the 4th lap of your favorite backcountry stash, your jacket will still be breathing easily. Made with Gore-Tex(R) Active shell fabric, it provides complete waterproof protection while remaining highly breathable; rapid moisture transfer helps keep you dry and warm. The inner backer fabric is integrated directly into the membrane, allowing exceptional breathability and excellent next-to-skin comfort. This incredible breathability negates the need for pit zippers, which further saves weight in this streamlined and durable shell. Helmet-compatible hood shields head from the elements; side and back volume adjustments tailor the fit without impairing vision or limiting mobility. Interior stormflap behind front zipper keeps chilling wind out; chin guard protects sensitive skin. Low-proflile, water-resistant zippers protect from moisture and save on overall weight. Drawcord hem and rip-and-stick cuff closures seal in warmth. 2 hand pockets and a zip chest pocket provide quick stash options; hand pockets are set so they won't interfere with hip belt or climbing harness. Left hand pocket doubles as a stuff sack. Articulated elbows provide a natural fit and superior movement. Outdoor Research Axiom jacket has a trim fit that keeps jacket close while still allowing for athletic and dynamic movement.","short_description":"Innovative, lightweight and extremely breathable, the Outdoor Research Axiom storm-shell jacket is engineered for fast and light alpine climbs and all-day lapping of untracked slopes.","category":"Men's Clothing","subcategory":"Men's Jackets","product_group":"Men's Rain Jackets","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s401943.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l401943.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=401943&tt=df","keywords":"hardshell","retail_price":"375.00","sale_price":"375.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=401943\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m401943.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=846524&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8465240001":{"sku":"8465240001","vendor_sku":"55145151S","upc":"727602213361","size":"S","color":"BLACK/LEMONGRASS","retail_price":"375.00","sale_price":"375.00"},"8465240003":{"sku":"8465240003","vendor_sku":"55145151L","upc":"727602213385","size":"L","color":"BLACK/LEMONGRASS","retail_price":"375.00","sale_price":"375.00"},"8465240004":{"sku":"8465240004","vendor_sku":"55145151XL","upc":"727602213392","size":"XL","color":"BLACK/LEMONGRASS","retail_price":"375.00","sale_price":"375.00"},"8465240010":{"sku":"8465240010","vendor_sku":"55145942M","upc":"727602213453","size":"M","color":"GLACIER/ABYSS","retail_price":"375.00","sale_price":"375.00"},"8465240011":{"sku":"8465240011","vendor_sku":"55145942L","upc":"727602213460","size":"L","color":"GLACIER/ABYSS","retail_price":"375.00","sale_price":"375.00"},"8465240012":{"sku":"8465240012","vendor_sku":"55145942XL","upc":"727602213477","size":"XL","color":"GLACIER/ABYSS","retail_price":"375.00","sale_price":"375.00"}},"categories":["mens","mens-jackets","mens-rain-jackets"]}
