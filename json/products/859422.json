{"sku":"859422","manufacturer_id":"05006400 001","brand_name":"Nordica","product_name":" Nordica Hell and Back H3 Ski Boots - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"A medium flexing boot with built-in shock absorbtion, the Nordica Hell and Back H3 ski boots for men offer an excellent mix of precision and performance for intermediates exploring the mountain. Full Shock Eraser (FSE) liners feature extra padding under the feet, in the tongues and in the cuffs to absorb shock and damp vibrations. Built into the shells, FSE wedges provide superb shock absorption and vibration damping while stomping big-air landings. FSE toe boxes pad the front of your feet, reducing painful toe bang, and rear FSE spoilers offer rear support. Recently redesigned shell materials offer extremely light weight so you can ski longer and enjoy your time on the mountain. Hand-stitched liners snugly wrap feet in cushioning foam and offer large toe boxes to improve circulation and warmth; closed-cell foam against the shells enhances warmth. Water-resistant wraparound shields protect feet from moisture seeping into the boots. High-traction soles offer grippy perfomance for walking and hiking. Nordica Hell and Back H3 ski boots for men have a medium 100 flex index, providing the power transfer suited to intermediate skiers.","short_description":"A medium flexing boot with built-in shock absorbtion, the Nordica Hell and Back H3 ski boots for men offer an excellent mix of precision and performance for intermediates exploring the mountain.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Downhill Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382595.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382595.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382595&tt=df","retail_price":"399.00","sale_price":"278.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382595\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382595.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859422&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8594220001":{"sku":"8594220001","vendor_sku":"05006400 001","upc":"885315622310","size":"Mondo 26.5","color":"BLACK/ORANGE","retail_price":"278.83","sale_price":"278.83"},"8594220002":{"sku":"8594220002","vendor_sku":"05006400 001","upc":"885315622334","size":"Mondo 27.5","color":"BLACK/ORANGE","retail_price":"278.83","sale_price":"278.83"},"8594220004":{"sku":"8594220004","vendor_sku":"05006400 001","upc":"885315622372","size":"Mondo 29.5","color":"BLACK/ORANGE","retail_price":"278.83","sale_price":"278.83"}},"categories":["snow","ski-boots","downhill-ski-boots"]}
