{"sku":"839967","manufacturer_id":"620606","brand_name":"Black Diamond","product_name":" Black Diamond Cosmo Headlamp","long_description":"With a maximum light output of 70 lumens, the Black Diamond Cosmo headlamp delivers a high-quality beam that is well-suited for night hikes, route finding and use around the campsite. 1 central DoublePower LED throws a 70 lumen beam a maximum distance of 40m; 2 proximity LEDs throw a 16 lumen beam up to 25m or down to 6m for activities around camp. Set the brightness of the light to meet your needs with the dimming switch-simply hold down the on/off button to activate dimmer. High-quality lens tunes the light output and shape of the beam to make the Cosmo ideal for general outdoor use. Use the on/off button to navigate from the bright DoublePower LED, to the 2 proximity LEDs and then to the strobe function. Switch to the single red LED to look at maps or read a guidebook without ruining your night vision. Streamline design sets the beam at an efficient illumination angle; ratcheting swivel head aims light where you need it. Compact design fits securely around the head with an adjustable elastic band that won't pull hair. 3 AAA batteries (included) provide up to 250 hrs. of use on low and 43 hrs. on high; battery compartment is just behind LEDs for a compact design. IPX4 water-resistant construction ensures the Black Diamond Cosmo headlamp will work in inclement weather.","short_description":"With a maximum light output of 70 lumens, the Black Diamond Cosmo headlamp delivers a high-quality beam that is well-suited for night hikes, route finding and use around the campsite.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Camp Lighting","product_group":"Headlamps","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s417119.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l417119.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=417119&tt=df","retail_price":"29.95","sale_price":"29.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=417119\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m417119.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=839967&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8399670001":{"sku":"8399670001","vendor_sku":"620606","upc":"793661175490","color":"DARK SHADOW","retail_price":"29.95","sale_price":"29.95"},"8399670002":{"sku":"8399670002","vendor_sku":"620606","upc":"793661175520","color":"PLUM","retail_price":"29.95","sale_price":"29.95"},"8399670003":{"sku":"8399670003","vendor_sku":"620606","upc":"793661175544","color":"ULTRA WHITE","retail_price":"29.95","sale_price":"29.95"},"8399670004":{"sku":"8399670004","vendor_sku":"620606","upc":"793661175537","color":"PROCESS BLUE","retail_price":"29.95","sale_price":"29.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","camp-lighting","headlamps"]}
