ReliaWool is a patent-pending reinforcement construction that puts more wool in high wear/high impact areas to increase durability and comfort. Merino wool provides excellent temperature control and moisture management, so you're warm when it's cold and cool when it's warm. Strategically placed mesh zones provide ventilation for temperature and moisture management. Merino wool keeps your feet dry and inhospitable to bacteria that can cause odor.
