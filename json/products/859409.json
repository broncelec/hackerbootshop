Rear zipper secures fit and features an extra-long zipper pull; soft neoprene gusset prevents zipper abrasion. Two rip-and-stick tabs at neck seal securely. Brushed chest fabric on interior of suit boosts warmth and manages moisture. You'll enjoy full freedom of motion without chafing thanks to flexibly sealed seams. Tough fabric over knees increases durability. Key loop near back zipper offers a convenient place to store a key. Hand wash the men's Quiksilver Pyre 4/3mm Back Zip wetsuit guards heat in cold water, drip dry out of sun and store in a cool, dry place.","short_description":"The men's Quiksilver Pyre 4/3mm Back-Zip wetsuit guards heat for watersports in spring and fall water temperatures.
