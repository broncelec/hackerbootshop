{"sku":"831581","manufacturer_id":"10502","brand_name":"Poc","product_name":" POC Trabec Race MIPS Bike Helmet","long_description":"The POC Trabec Race MIPS bike helmet uses strategically placed layers of materials and the MIPS system to offer sturdy protection for your noggin. Tough outer shell joins with an internal aramid shell bonded to a shock-absorbent expanded polystyrene layer, all of which produces a helmet of exceptional resiliency. Helmet design aims to protect more of the head, coming down lower on the sides and back to offer more coverage, and, in turn, more protection. MIPS system uses a low-friction layer between the outer shell and the head to limit the rotational forces to the brain in the event of an oblique impact. 16 vents on the front, top, sides and rear of helmet channel fresh air over your head, helping keep you cool and comfortable. Helmet comes with a removable visor. It's easy to achieve a comfortable fit with the POC Trabec Race MIPS bike helmet, thanks to the adjustable straps and rear harness. Comfortable foam padding can be changed to personalize fit and can be removed for cleaning. Please note: while the Trabec Race MIPS helmet is designed to withstand multiple impacts, it should be inspected after any crash, using your best judgement for continued use.","short_description":"The POC Trabec Race MIPS bike helmet uses strategically placed layers of materials and the MIPS system to offer sturdy protection for your noggin.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Helmets","product_group":"Mountain Bike Helmets","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s383579.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l383579.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=383579&tt=df","retail_price":"230.00","sale_price":"230.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=383579\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m383579.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=831581&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8315810005":{"sku":"8315810005","vendor_sku":"10502","upc":"483158100059","size":"M/L","color":"WHITE/BLACK","retail_price":"230.00","sale_price":"230.00"},"8315810006":{"sku":"8315810006","vendor_sku":"10502","upc":"483158100066","size":"XL/XXL","color":"WHITE/BLACK","retail_price":"230.00","sale_price":"230.00"},"8315810007":{"sku":"8315810007","vendor_sku":"10502","size":"XS/S","color":"RADON BLUE","retail_price":"230.00","sale_price":"230.00"},"8315810008":{"sku":"8315810008","vendor_sku":"10502","size":"M/L","color":"RADON BLUE","retail_price":"230.00","sale_price":"230.00"},"8315810009":{"sku":"8315810009","vendor_sku":"10502","size":"XL/XXL","color":"RADON BLUE","retail_price":"230.00","sale_price":"230.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-helmets","mountain-bike-helmets"]}
