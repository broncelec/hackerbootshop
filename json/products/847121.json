{"sku":"847121","manufacturer_id":"32104000","brand_name":"Exped","product_name":"Exped DreamWalker DUO 400 Sleeping Bag - Double","long_description":"Why carry the weight of 2 separate sleeping bags when you and your sweetheart can snuggle up under the Exped DreamWalker DUO 400 sleeping bag on your summertime mountain adventures?. Lightweight down-insulated sleeping bag is used together with the included sheet and 2 sleeping pads (sold separately) to create a multifunctional double bed. Cover 2 sleeping pads (sold separately) with the included sheet, then snap the DreamWalker to the sheet to keep it in place throughout the night. Slide your feet inside the built-in foot bag at the bottom of the DreamWalker for extra insulation; if too warm, stretch your feet out under the foot bag. Side baffles on the quilt prevent cold air from entering along the edges. Soft sheet is comfortable next to skin; mesh sides prevent moisture on the floor of your tent from migrating up the sheet. Drawcords keep the sheet snug around your sleeping pads. Flip the DreamWalker in half and snap it to itself to create a rectangular down sleeping bag for solo use. Wear the DreamWalker DUO as an insulated poncho to keep you warm while you're hanging around camp; zippered slit in the middle of the quilt serves as a head opening. 2 zippered pockets allow each person to store small items within reach. The Exped DreamWalker DUO 400 sleeping bag includes a stuff sack and storage sack. Size M and Large Wide differ only in the size of the sheet; size M sheet fits over 2 Exped size M mats; size Large Wide sheet fits over 2 Exped Large Wide mats. Pillows and sleeping pads that are pictured with the sleeping bag are sold separately.","short_description":"Why carry the weight of 2 separate sleeping bags when you and your sweetheart can snuggle up under the Exped DreamWalker DUO 400 sleeping bag on your summertime mountain adventures?.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags And Accessories","product_group":"Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s421359.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l421359.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=421359&tt=df","keywords":"compact","retail_price":"429.00","sale_price":"429.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=421359\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m421359.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=847121&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8471210001":{"sku":"8471210001","vendor_sku":"32104000","size":"M","color":"RUBY RED","retail_price":"429.00","sale_price":"429.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sleeping-bags-and-accessories","sleeping-bags"]}
