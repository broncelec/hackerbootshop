Designed by shaping expert Randy French, this board is designed for stability and glide and is a great choice for flatwater touring and light surf. Very high volume and 240 lb. capacity makes this board an excellent choice for large paddlers. Full rails and a wide platform enhance stability. High-quality, pressure-molded EPS core is watertight; should you ding your board, water will not enter and weigh the board down as it might with cores of lesser quality. Waterproof EPS core is encased in multiple layers of fiberglass and high-quality epoxy resin to create a lightweight, highly responsive board; EPS core is fully recyclable. In addition to ensuring a comfortable experience underfoot, integrated Softop EVA deck offers reliable wax-free traction when paddling in the standing or kneeling position. Single center fin promotes straight tracking in the water. Center handle makes transporting the 42 lb. Universal 12 ft. paddleboard a breeze.","short_description":"The Surftech Universal 12 ft. stand up paddleboard is ready to chase your endless summer.","category":"Paddling","subcategory":"Paddleboarding","product_group":"Paddleboards","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s430755.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l430755.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=430755&tt=df","retail_price":"1300.00","sale_price":"938.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=430755\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m430755.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=831439&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8314390001":{"sku":"8314390001","vendor_sku":"SA107","upc":"483143900015","size":"12 FT","color":"GRAY/BROWN","retail_price":"938.93","sale_price":"938.93"}},"categories":["paddling","paddleboarding","paddleboards"]}
