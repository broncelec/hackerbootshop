Heavy-duty recyclable plastic construction stands up to wear and tear; injection-molded arms and legs will never rust, and can support 2 bikes with ease. Ratchet straps securely hold bikes in place; anti-sway, articulated feet protect the paint on your car, ensuring bikes and vehicle aren't damaged. Cradle design accommodates most bicycle frame designs. Easily fits a wide range of vehicles including sedans, hatchbacks and minivans. Not intended for tandem or recumbent bikes; carrying bikes with step-through frames requires the purchase of an adapter (sold separately).","short_description":"The Saris Bones 2-Bike Trunk rack has an innovative arc-based design that separates bikes to different levels and fits over the spoilers of many cars.","category":"Car Racks","subcategory":"Bike Racks","product_group":"Trunk-Mounted Bike Racks","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s380743.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l380743.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=380743&tt=df","keywords":"rear","retail_price":"149.95","sale_price":"149.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=380743\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m380743.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=853367&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8533670002":{"sku":"8533670002","vendor_sku":"805BL","upc":"012527008919","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"149.95","sale_price":"149.95"}},"categories":["car-racks","bike-racks","trunkmounted-bike-racks"]}
