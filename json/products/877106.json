{"sku":"877106","manufacturer_id":"T11322","brand_name":"Patagonia","product_name":"Patagonia Rover Hiking Shoes - Women's","long_description":"The women's Patagonia Rover Hiking Shoes combine the best attributes of minimalist trail-running shoes with dual-zone sticky rubber soles for mobility in the mountains when your run goes vertical. Abrasion-resistant air mesh/synthetic leather uppers with toe rands balance protection and lightweight breathability; self-centering, stretch gusseted tongues keep debris out. Variable lacing system allows for a fully adjustable fit for improved footing/comfort when ascending and descending. Integrated 2mm footbeds with Dri-Lex(R) lining provide temperature and moisture control. Soft-flexing, 4mm-drop midsoles provide natural foot strike; 20% recycled dual-density EVA (heel is softer; ball harder); heel wedge provides increased cushioning. Patagonia Rover Hiking Shoes have 0.8mm-thick forefoot ESS plates to protect against rocks. Extra-sticky rubber outsoles provide essential grip on a variety of terrain; include climbing-focused toe areas for edging and traction-focused heels for loose surfaces.","short_description":"The women's Patagonia Rover Hiking Shoes combine the best attributes of minimalist trail-running shoes with dual-zone sticky rubber soles for mobility in the mountains when your run goes vertical.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Women's Footwear","product_group":"Women's Shoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s457663.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l457663.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=457663&tt=df","keywords":"trail","retail_price":"125.00","sale_price":"125.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=457663\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m457663.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=877106&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8771060001":{"sku":"8771060001","vendor_sku":"T11322","upc":"018466795200","size":"6","color":"FORGE GREY/CATALAN CORAL","retail_price":"125.00","sale_price":"125.00"},"8771060002":{"sku":"8771060002","vendor_sku":"T11322","upc":"018466795217","size":"6.5","color":"FORGE GREY/CATALAN CORAL","retail_price":"125.00","sale_price":"125.00"},"8771060003":{"sku":"8771060003","vendor_sku":"T11322","upc":"018466795224","size":"7","color":"FORGE GREY/CATALAN CORAL","retail_price":"125.00","sale_price":"125.00"},"8771060004":{"sku":"8771060004","vendor_sku":"T11322","upc":"018466795231","size":"7.5","color":"FORGE GREY/CATALAN CORAL","retail_price":"125.00","sale_price":"125.00"},"8771060005":{"sku":"8771060005","vendor_sku":"T11322","upc":"018466795255","size":"8","color":"FORGE GREY/CATALAN CORAL","retail_price":"125.00","sale_price":"125.00"},"8771060006":{"sku":"8771060006","vendor_sku":"T11322","upc":"018466795279","size":"8.5","color":"FORGE GREY/CATALAN CORAL","retail_price":"125.00","sale_price":"125.00"},"8771060007":{"sku":"8771060007","vendor_sku":"T11322","upc":"018466795286","size":"9","color":"FORGE GREY/CATALAN CORAL","retail_price":"125.00","sale_price":"125.00"},"8771060008":{"sku":"8771060008","vendor_sku":"T11322","upc":"018466795477","size":"9.5","color":"FORGE GREY/CATALAN CORAL","retail_price":"125.00","sale_price":"125.00"},"8771060009":{"sku":"8771060009","vendor_sku":"T11322","upc":"018466795484","size":"10","color":"FORGE GREY/CATALAN CORAL","retail_price":"125.00","sale_price":"125.00"}},"categories":["footwear","womens-footwear","womens-shoes"]}
