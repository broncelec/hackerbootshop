Polyester mesh uppers let water flow freely from shoes and dry quickly for comfort; thermoplastic urethane overlays supply support.

Fold-down, Shoc Pad(TM) heels let him wear them like slippers if he prefers. Neoprene linings help protect bare feet from pressure and abrasion, and won't hold excess water. Drain-Frame molded EVA insoles add cushioning; perforations allow water to escape so feet don't have to swim. Thin nylon shanks add stability and control underfoot. EVA midsoles in the Teva Churn boys' water shoes absorb and transfer shock for enhanced push-off energy.
