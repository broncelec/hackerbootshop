{"sku":"853418","manufacturer_id":"84026","brand_name":"Patagonia","product_name":"Patagonia Nano Puff Pullover - Women's","long_description":"Sleek, light and surprisingly warm, the women's Patagonia Nano Puff Pullover is made from warm, incredibly lightweight, highly compressible PrimaLoft(R) One synthetic insulation. Wear it as a pullover in cool, dry weather, or as an insulating layer beneath a shell jacket when it's cold and wet out. Nano blocks wind, sheds snow and traps heat, even when wet; 60g PrimaLoft One is incredibly warm, low-bulk, compressible and hydrophobic. Deep-venting half-zip has a soft, wicking interior stormflap and zipper garage. Recycled ripstop polyester glides effortlessly when worn with other layers; Durable Water Repellent finish fends off light rain showers and snow. Classic brick quilting pattern through the torso and waist with narrow horizontal quilting at the side panels adds shape; burly thread adds durability. Packs down to practically nothing and stuffs into the single chest pocket that has a carabiner clip-in loop. Elasticized cuffs and hem seal out wind and trap warmth. The women's Patagonia Nano Puff pullover has a regular fit.","short_description":"Sleek, light and surprisingly warm, the women's Patagonia Nano Puff Pullover is made from warm, incredibly lightweight, highly compressible PrimaLoft(R) One synthetic insulation.","category":"Women's Clothing","subcategory":"Women's Jackets","product_group":"Women's Insulated Jackets","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s393523.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l393523.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=393523&tt=df","retail_price":"169.00","sale_price":"169.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=393523\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m393523.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=853418&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8534180023":{"sku":"8534180023","vendor_sku":"84026","upc":"887187454631","size":"M","color":"DESERT TURQUOISE","retail_price":"169.00","sale_price":"169.00"},"8534180024":{"sku":"8534180024","vendor_sku":"84026","upc":"887187454655","size":"L","color":"DESERT TURQUOISE","retail_price":"169.00","sale_price":"169.00"},"8534180025":{"sku":"8534180025","vendor_sku":"84026","upc":"887187454679","size":"XL","color":"DESERT TURQUOISE","retail_price":"169.00","sale_price":"169.00"},"8534180028":{"sku":"8534180028","vendor_sku":"84026","upc":"887187454525","size":"M","color":"CATALAN CORAL","retail_price":"169.00","sale_price":"169.00"},"8534180029":{"sku":"8534180029","vendor_sku":"84026","upc":"887187454532","size":"L","color":"CATALAN CORAL","retail_price":"169.00","sale_price":"169.00"},"8534180030":{"sku":"8534180030","vendor_sku":"84026","upc":"887187454549","size":"XL","color":"CATALAN CORAL","retail_price":"169.00","sale_price":"169.00"}},"categories":["womens","womens-jackets","womens-insulated-jackets"]}
