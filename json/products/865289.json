{"sku":"865289","manufacturer_id":"14M420340","brand_name":"Vibram","product_name":"Vibram FiveFingers Spyridon MR Trail-Running Shoes - Men's","long_description":"Designed for the minimalist trail runner, the Vibram FiveFingers Spyridon MR Trail Running Shoes offer aggressive traction, foot sole protection and durable construction for great performance. Feet stay protected and breathe easily, thanks to the stretchy polyester uppers; sturdy construction ensures lasting performance on the trails. Zero drop from heel to toe encourages a natural midfoot or forefoot strike to promote forward momentum and reduce the impact of heel striking. Quick-lace closure system and locking toggle allow for a secure, personalized fit with just a single pull; lace end secures with small rip-and-stick tab. Individual toe slots enhance dexterity, control and stability, helping enable a natural foot motion; toe bumpers supply added protection. Moisture-wicking, antimicrobial Drilex(R) nylon covers 3mm polyurethane midsoles, providing comfort and cushioning underfoot. 360deg lug pattern offers grip in all directions, perfect for your next mud obstacle course or trail race. Vibram FiveFingers Spyridon MR Trail-Running Shoes are machine washable in cold water; air dry only, away from sun or heat source. All-synthetic construction makes these vegan-friendly. To determine size, stand with heels against a wall and measure from the wall to the tip of the longest toe on each foot; use the longer of the 2 lengths with the size chart.","short_description":"Designed for the minimalist trail runner, the Vibram FiveFingers Spyridon MR Trail Running Shoes offer aggressive traction, foot sole protection and durable construction for great performance.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Men's Footwear","product_group":"Men's Shoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s386139.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l386139.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=386139&tt=df","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=386139\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m386139.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=865289&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8652890002":{"sku":"8652890002","vendor_sku":"14M420341","upc":"847100041775","size":"41","color":"GREY/ORANGE","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8652890003":{"sku":"8652890003","vendor_sku":"14M420342","upc":"847100041799","size":"42","color":"GREY/ORANGE","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8652890004":{"sku":"8652890004","vendor_sku":"14M420343","upc":"847100041829","size":"43","color":"GREY/ORANGE","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8652890006":{"sku":"8652890006","vendor_sku":"14M420345","upc":"847100041867","size":"45","color":"GREY/ORANGE","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8652890007":{"sku":"8652890007","vendor_sku":"14M420346","upc":"847100041881","size":"46","color":"GREY/ORANGE","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"}},"categories":["footwear","mens-footwear","mens-shoes"]}
