Tri-Align Caliper Positioning System(TM) aligns caliper easily for fast, simple installation and adjustment. Features inboard and outboard pad adjustment knobs, rigid 2-piece forged body and tool-free pad replacement. Integrated cable stop prevents routing cable and housing from entering the brake at odd angles, reducing the possibility of cable drag. Includes a 6-bolt heat-dissipating HS-1 rotor and alloy-backed brake pads that use a lightweight organic compound. Titanium bolts help shed weight. Avid BB7 Road SL mechanical disc brake is optimized for use with short-pull, road style levers (e.g. STI, drop, canti); levers not included. Caliper is 74mm; adapter for 51mm International Standard brake mounts is included.
