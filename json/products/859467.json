{"sku":"859467","manufacturer_id":"V","brand_name":"Twentytwo Designs","product_name":" TwentyTwo Designs Vice Telemark Bindings","long_description":"Incorporating features from the rugged Axl, but designed for the resort rather than backcountry, the TwentyTwo Designs Vice telemark bindings provide three pivot positions to match your skiing style. Adjust the feel of the bindings by selecting one of three cable guide positions; move the pin forward for a more neutral feel and back for a more active feel. The Vice bindings do not have a free-pivot touring function, making them ideal for your hard-charging, lift-served days at the ski resort. Cables and springs are routed underfoot to allow telemark boots to flex naturally at the bellows; springs provide more than 2 in. of travel. 2,000-lb. test cable and solid steel toe pieces withstand hard use in the mountains. Size Small TwentyTwo Designs Vice telemark binding fit boots Mondo size 25.5 and under; size Large fits Mondo 26 and up.","short_description":"Incorporating features from the rugged Axl, but designed for the resort rather than backcountry, the TwentyTwo Designs Vice telemark bindings provide three pivot positions to match your skiing style.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Bindings","product_group":"Telemark Ski Bindings","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s381751.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l381751.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=381751&tt=df","retail_price":"220.00","sale_price":"220.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=381751\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m381751.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859467&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8594670001":{"sku":"8594670001","vendor_sku":"V","upc":"485946700014","size":"L","retail_price":"220.00","sale_price":"220.00"},"8594670002":{"sku":"8594670002","vendor_sku":"VS","upc":"485946700021","size":"S","retail_price":"220.00","sale_price":"220.00"}},"categories":["snow","ski-bindings","telemark-ski-bindings"]}
