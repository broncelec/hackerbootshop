{"sku":"858170","manufacturer_id":"8A315200001","brand_name":"Blizzard","product_name":"Blizzard Peacemaker Skis - Men's - 2013-2014","long_description":"A playful, wide-waisted twin tip for advanced skiers on any terrain, the Blizzard Peacemaker skis use naturally rockered tips to resist chatter on groomers, float high in pow and bust up crud. Blizzard builds the rocker without bending the core, creating a naturally flexing, responsive ski that turns easily, resists high-speed chatter and shreds crud and pow. Light camber underfoot assists with grip on hardpack. Not as stiff as metal-reinforced skis, the Peacemaker skis use a fiberglass layup to lend a playful feel for smearing pillow lines and skidding around in pow. Wood core is constructed like a sandwich with layers of precisely-milled strips reinforcing each other to create a lightweight, snappy ski with smooth and easy handling. Sidewalls direct power right to the edges of the skis, resulting in quick side-to-side response. True twin profile provides equal responsiveness whether you're skiing forward or backward. 104mm waists require bindings with wide brakes.","short_description":"A playful, wide-waisted twin tip for advanced skiers on any terrain, the Blizzard Peacemaker skis use naturally rockered tips to resist chatter on groomers, float high in pow and bust up crud.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s381951.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l381951.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=381951&tt=df","retail_price":"599.95","sale_price":"419.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=381951\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m381951.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=858170&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8581700001":{"sku":"8581700001","vendor_sku":"8A315200001","upc":"885315549662","size":"179 CM","color":"RED/BLUE","retail_price":"419.83","sale_price":"419.83"},"8581700002":{"sku":"8581700002","vendor_sku":"8A315200001","upc":"885315549686","size":"186 CM","color":"RED/BLUE","retail_price":"419.83","sale_price":"419.83"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
