{"sku":"837169","manufacturer_id":"120116 1B 604","brand_name":"Brooks","product_name":"Brooks Ariel Road-Running Shoes - Women's","long_description":"Brooks Ariel road-running shoes deliver sturdy motion control in a comfortable, flexible and highly tuned platform for those needing ample support for everyday fitness running or training. Lightweight and flexible polyester and nylon mesh uppers are abrasion resistant and breathable, and dry quickly; overlays provide structure and support. Polyester and nylon air-mesh linings provide great moisture management to keep feet comfortable on the run; internal support saddle helps wrap and hold feet in place. Insole boards use a foam polymer alloy formulated to resist compression and rebound more quickly than standard EVA, offering lasting, efficient cushioning and flexibility. Midsoles feature BioMoGo polymer alloy foam, which provides cushioning, energy return and reduced foot fatigue; nontoxic additive helps midsoles break down in landfills. Cushioning pods use high viscosity liquid to react instantly to each step, dispersing impact and customizing the cushioning for different runners and running styles. Extended PDRB(TM) (Progressive Diagonal Roll Bar) triple-density medial posts work to control excessive pronation and balance transitions from midfoot to toe-off. Midfoot thermoplastic urethane arch shanks control torsional flex at midfoot for control and support. Forefoot MC-Pod configuration balances midsole and outsole components to set feet in an efficient, balanced position, maximizing motion control and flexibility. Flex grooves enhance midsole flexibility for an effortless, efficient ride that maintains cushioning; midsole density has been tuned to optimize cushioning per gender. Outsoles on the Brooks Ariel shoes are constructed out of a mix of rubber compounds to maximize longevity; compound also offers excellent traction in wet and dry conditions. Outsoles also feature a special decoupled crash pad design that smooths out the landing zone throughout the heel strike.","short_description":"Brooks Ariel road-running shoes deliver sturdy motion control in a comfortable, flexible and highly tuned platform for those needing ample support for everyday fitness running or training.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Women's Footwear","product_group":"Women's Shoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s387339.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l387339.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=387339&tt=df","retail_price":"140.00","sale_price":"140.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=387339\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m387339.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=837169&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8371690001":{"sku":"8371690001","vendor_sku":"1200741B294","upc":"883439589717","size":"6","color":"ANGEL BLUE/SHADOW/SILVER","retail_price":"140.00","sale_price":"140.00"},"8371690012":{"sku":"8371690012","vendor_sku":"120116 1B 604","upc":"883439715420","size":"6","color":"SILVER/OMBRE/DAZZLING BLU","retail_price":"140.00","sale_price":"140.00"},"8371690013":{"sku":"8371690013","vendor_sku":"120116 1B 604","upc":"883439715444","size":"6.5","color":"SILVER/OMBRE/DAZZLING BLU","retail_price":"140.00","sale_price":"140.00"},"8371690014":{"sku":"8371690014","vendor_sku":"120116 1B 604","upc":"883439715468","size":"7","color":"SILVER/OMBRE/DAZZLING BLU","retail_price":"140.00","sale_price":"140.00"},"8371690015":{"sku":"8371690015","vendor_sku":"120116 1B 604","upc":"883439715499","size":"7.5","color":"SILVER/OMBRE/DAZZLING BLU","retail_price":"140.00","sale_price":"140.00"},"8371690016":{"sku":"8371690016","vendor_sku":"120116 1B 604","upc":"883439715529","size":"8","color":"SILVER/OMBRE/DAZZLING BLU","retail_price":"140.00","sale_price":"140.00"},"8371690017":{"sku":"8371690017","vendor_sku":"120116 1B 604","upc":"883439715550","size":"8.5","color":"SILVER/OMBRE/DAZZLING BLU","retail_price":"140.00","sale_price":"140.00"},"8371690018":{"sku":"8371690018","vendor_sku":"120116 1B 604","upc":"883439715581","size":"9","color":"SILVER/OMBRE/DAZZLING BLU","retail_price":"140.00","sale_price":"140.00"},"8371690019":{"sku":"8371690019","vendor_sku":"120116 1B 604","upc":"883439715611","size":"9.5","color":"SILVER/OMBRE/DAZZLING BLU","retail_price":"140.00","sale_price":"140.00"},"8371690020":{"sku":"8371690020","vendor_sku":"120116 1B 604","upc":"883439715642","size":"10","color":"SILVER/OMBRE/DAZZLING BLU","retail_price":"140.00","sale_price":"140.00"}},"categories":["footwear","womens-footwear","womens-shoes"]}
