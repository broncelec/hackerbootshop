{"sku":"737300","manufacturer_id":"501760P","brand_name":"Bluewater","product_name":" BlueWater II Plus 7/16'' Static Rope","long_description":"BlueWater II Plus(TM) rope is a classic and economical choice for rappelling, rescue and caving. Especially useful in applications where dynamic \"bounce\" is unwanted: jumaring, rappelling and hauling. Kernmantle design matches a static nylon core (kern) with an abrasion-resistant braided polyester sheath (mantle) for durability. Double twist cabled core and sheath strands help combat twisting while hanging on the rope. Sheath design permits easier tying and untying of knots than some other static lines. Buy it by the foot, as much or as little as you need.","short_description":"BlueWater II Plus(TM) rope is a classic and economical choice for rappelling, rescue and caving.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Ropes","product_group":"Static And Rescue Ropes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s383827.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l383827.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=383827&tt=df","keywords":"rappel","retail_price":"0.95","sale_price":"0.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=383827\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m383827.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=737300&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7373000012":{"sku":"7373000012","vendor_sku":"501760P","upc":"732670032875","size":"7/16 IN","retail_price":"0.95","sale_price":"0.95"}}}
