{"sku":"830941","manufacturer_id":"042LL","brand_name":"Sea To Summit","product_name":"Sea to Summit Trek TkII Sleeping Bag","long_description":"Pack this lightweight Sea to Summit Trek TkII down sleeping bag for your next hostel trip through Europe or backpacking in South America. It keeps you warm in a broad range of environments! Insulated with 650-fill-power duck down for warmth, light weight and compressibility; Ultra-Dry Down(TM) water-repellent treatment protects down from moisture. Ultra-Dry Down is a water-repellent polymer treatment applied to the 650-fill down; Ultra-Dry Down retains 60% more loft and absorbs 30% less moisture than untreated down. With a European Norm (EN) lower-limit rating of 18degF, the TkII bag will help keep you warm on spring, summer and fall backpacking trips. Shell fabric is constructed of a high-density weave, 33-denier fabric treated with a Durable Water Repellent finish. Shell material is highly vapor permeable and downproof. Lining is a breathable, durable 40-denier nylon fabric with a soft touch. Full-length side zipper and foot zipper allow bag to be converted from traditional sleeping bag to a duvet/down comforter. Semirectangular shape provides more room than a mummy bag for a more comfortable sleeping bag while maintaining thermal efficiency. Differentially cut inner layer is smaller than the outer layer to create a consistent thickness of insulation that precludes cold spots. Oversize draft tube backing the 2-way zipper keeps the warmth in and the cold out; zipper is backed by stiff, antisnag tape for smooth operation. Large interior secuity pocket is great for stowing a few essentials, alleviating middle-of-the-night fumbling. Baffle construction allows the goose down to remain fully lofted and keeps it from shifting. Sea to Summit Trek TkII bag comes with a Ultra-Sil(R) compression sack, an oversized mesh storage cell and a large cotton sack. European Norm (EN) is an independent third-party temperature rating, allowing accurate comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags.","short_description":"Pack this lightweight Sea to Summit Trek TkII down sleeping bag for your next hostel trip through Europe or backpacking in South America.
