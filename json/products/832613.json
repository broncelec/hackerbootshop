{"sku":"832613","manufacturer_id":"DSWGFEDLI8","brand_name":"Kokatat","product_name":"Kokatat Gore-Tex Front Entry Dry Suit with Drop Seat - Women's","long_description":"Designed for the adventurous paddler, the women's Kokatat Gore-Tex(R) Front Entry dry suit with drop seat offers more comfort than neoprene wetsuits can provide. Tough nylon with Gore-Tex Pro Shell laminate is completely waterproof, extremely breathable and highly durable. Tough reinforcements at knees and seat boost abrasion resistance and durability. Specialized sleeves enhance freedom of motion and won't restrict movement when paddling. Neoprene neck gasket seals with skin to help keep water out. Elastic drawcord waist with cordlock keeps suit snugly fitted around midsection. Waterproof front-entry zipper eases dressing and zippered, drop-away seat makes pit stops quick and easy. Adjustable leg and arm cuffs with rip-and-stick closures dial in the fit; arm cuffs have latex gaskets to enhance protection. Reflective highlights on front of suit enhance visibility in low light. Integrated Gore-Tex socks are more comfortable than latex gaskets and prevent water from entering suit at legs. Machine or hand wash in cold water with powdered detergent; do not bleach or dry clean; store dry, hanging or loosely folded.","short_description":"Designed for the adventurous paddler, the women's Kokatat Gore-Tex(R) Front Entry dry suit with drop seat offers more comfort than neoprene wetsuits can provide.","category":"Paddling","subcategory":"Paddling Clothing","product_group":"Dry Suits","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s431507.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l431507.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=431507&tt=df","retail_price":"970.00","sale_price":"970.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=431507\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m431507.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=832613&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8326130001":{"sku":"8326130001","vendor_sku":"DSWGFEDLI2","upc":"606891030203","size":"S","color":"LICHEN/GRAY","retail_price":"970.00","sale_price":"970.00"},"8326130002":{"sku":"8326130002","vendor_sku":"DSWGFEDLI3","upc":"606891030210","size":"M","color":"LICHEN/GRAY","retail_price":"970.00","sale_price":"970.00"},"8326130003":{"sku":"8326130003","vendor_sku":"DSWGFEDLI4","upc":"606891030227","size":"L","color":"LICHEN/GRAY","retail_price":"970.00","sale_price":"970.00"},"8326130004":{"sku":"8326130004","vendor_sku":"DSWGFEDLI8","upc":"606891030234","size":"XL","color":"LICHEN/GRAY","retail_price":"970.00","sale_price":"970.00"}},"categories":["paddling","paddling-clothing","dry-suits"]}
