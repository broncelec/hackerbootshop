{"sku":"852741","manufacturer_id":"A7KN-JK3","brand_name":"The North Face","product_name":"The North Face Saiku Gloves","long_description":"Grab your skis and get ready to explore backcountry terrain with the waterproof, insulated Saiku gloves from The North Face. They offer great dexterity for holding ski poles and handling zippers. Hyvent waterproof, breathable technology utilizes a polyurethane coating for waterproof protection, moisture permeability and durability. PrimaLoft(R) One is a patented ultrafine microfiber blend that offers downlike softness, and is incredibly lightweight and water repellent. 100g insulation on the palms and 150g on the backs of the hands keeps your fingers warm when you're skiing down cold, snowy slopes. Palms are lined with polyester with a FlashDry(TM) fabric additive that dramatically improves drying time and breathability without adding weight or bulk or washing out. 5 Dimensional Fit(TM) uses 5 measurements of the hand to construct gloves with an accurate and consistent fit. Radiametric Articulation(TM) improves warmth and blood flow to your fingers by mirroring the natural relaxed curve of the hand. The North Face Saiku gloves have water-resistant cowhide leather exteriors that stand up to regular use and provide great grip. Low-profile cuffs fit underneath your jacket; stretchy cuffs seal out cold air.","short_description":"Grab your skis and get ready to explore backcountry terrain with the waterproof, insulated Saiku gloves from The North Face.
