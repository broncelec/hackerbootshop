{"sku":"834893","manufacturer_id":"523161","brand_name":"Stohlquist","product_name":" Stohlquist Flo PFD - Women's","long_description":"The women-specific design of the Stohlquist Flo PFD is a great choice when looking for a compatible fit with seat backs found in many sit-on-top and recreational kayaks. Contoured inner cups wrap around body without uncomfortable pressure. Durable high-denier ripstop shell stands up to the tough love of paddling. Open sides enhance ventilation, and mesh shoulders and back enhance comfort. Cross-chest cinch strap design eliminates annoying ride up, and padded neoprene waistband enhances comfort. 1.5 in. webbing belt, shoulder webbing and side webbing easily adjust to create a low-profile fit. You can take small extras along thanks to self-draining pockets that expand to store accessories or even a beverage. Center-zip design with noncorroding zipper allows easy entry. 4-way lash tabs on front and back let you secure accessories such as strobes or knives (not included). Short length of the Stohlquist Flo PFD won't interfere with seat backs.","short_description":"The women-specific design of the Stohlquist Flo PFD is a great choice when looking for a compatible fit with seat backs found in many sit-on-top and recreational kayaks.","category":"Paddling","subcategory":"Pfds","product_group":"Women's Pfds","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s432007.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l432007.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=432007&tt=df","retail_price":"89.95","sale_price":"89.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=432007\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m432007.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=834893&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8348930002":{"sku":"8348930002","vendor_sku":"523161","upc":"053242254236","size":"M/L","color":"PURPLE","retail_price":"89.95","sale_price":"89.95"}},"categories":["paddling","pfds","womens-pfds"]}
