{"sku":"857950","manufacturer_id":"VN-0UEHY30","brand_name":"Vans","product_name":"Vans Cirro Snowboard Boots - 2013/2014","long_description":"With Boa(R) Focus lacing and an adjustable flex system, Vans Cirro snowboard boots offer the ultimate personalized fit for your all-mountain shred sessions. Personalize your boot flex with removable tongue stiffeners; use both for maximum support, use just one to increase either lateral or medial response, or remove them entirely. Vans Boa Focus lacing system personalizes the fit by allowing specific tightening across 3 separate zones: the upper, forefront and instep regions. Custom X thermal liners have an exterior overlay support cage that provides leg and ankle support for an anatomic and supportive fit. Direct-connect rip-and-stick closures and cuff straps prevent liner movement. Internal web harnesses hold liners closed for secure fit and prevent them from slipping inside shells; lace locks maintain desired tension. Molded cork/recycled EVA high-rebound footbeds feature integrated arch support, dual-density metatarsal and heel impact-relief pads, and Outlast-treated topsheets. Aggressive tacky rubber outsoles feature a hex-lug pattern for maximum traction; skate-style silhouette offers a low-profile fit for a true connection to your board. Each Vans Cirro boot has 2 RECCO(R) reflectors that enhance radio signals from search-and-rescue Recco detectors for quicker location in an avalanche.","short_description":"With Boa(R) Focus lacing and an adjustable flex system, Vans Cirro snowboard boots offer the ultimate personalized fit for your all-mountain shred sessions.","category":"Snowboarding","subcategory":"Snowboard Boots","product_group":"Men's Snowboard Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s447799.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l447799.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=447799&tt=df","retail_price":"339.95","sale_price":"201.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=447799\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m447799.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=857950&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8579500002":{"sku":"8579500002","vendor_sku":"VN-0UEHY30","upc":"887682050536","size":"9","color":"BLACK/GRAY","retail_price":"201.83","sale_price":"201.83"},"8579500003":{"sku":"8579500003","vendor_sku":"VN-0UEHY30","upc":"887682050529","size":"9.5","color":"BLACK/GRAY","retail_price":"201.83","sale_price":"201.83"},"8579500007":{"sku":"8579500007","vendor_sku":"VN-0UEHY30","upc":"887682050420","size":"11.5","color":"BLACK/GRAY","retail_price":"201.83","sale_price":"201.83"},"8579500008":{"sku":"8579500008","vendor_sku":"VN-0UEHY30","upc":"887682050437","size":"12","color":"BLACK/GRAY","retail_price":"201.83","sale_price":"201.83"}},"categories":["snow","snowboard-boots","mens-snowboard-boots"]}
