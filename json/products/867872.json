Co-extruded ABS laminate creates a hull that offers the looks and performance of a composite kayak with the durability of plastic. Plastic is shaped into a 2-layer sheet with durable interior and a an abrasion- and UV-resistant exterior, and then it's thermoformed using very high temperatures and a vacuum. 2-layer plastic laminate offers incredible stiffness and a hard, glossy appearance that resists abrasion and impact; plus, because it's plastic, it can also be easily repaired. Large cockpit makes it easy to get into kayak and soft foam seat and backrest enhance comfort during long paddles. Also features 2 hatches to store day-tripping gear, bow and stern bulkheads, bungee deck rigging and carry handles. Very manageable 35 lb. weight makes it easy to load the Eddyline Sky 10 Kayak on top of a car and carry it to the water.","short_description":"Built with abundant stability that beginners will love, the Eddyline Sky 10 Kayak offers high quality ABS construction in an eye-pleasing design for lakes, easy-going rivers and sheltered shores.","category":"Paddling","subcategory":"Kayaks","product_group":"Touring Kayaks","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s430711.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l430711.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=430711&tt=df","retail_price":"995.00","sale_price":"995.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=430711\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m430711.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=867872&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8678720001":{"sku":"8678720001","vendor_sku":"K-SKY 10 RED P","upc":"700736516409","size":"10 FT","color":"RED PEARL","retail_price":"995.00","sale_price":"995.00"},"8678720002":{"sku":"8678720002","vendor_sku":"K-SKY 10 GB","upc":"700736516416","size":"10 FT","color":"GALAXY BLUE","retail_price":"995.00","sale_price":"995.00"}},"categories":["paddling","kayaks","touring-kayaks"]}
