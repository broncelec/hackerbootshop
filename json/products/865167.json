{"sku":"865167","manufacturer_id":"40151314","brand_name":"Sierra Designs","product_name":" Sierra Designs Flashlight 1 Tent","long_description":"The 3-season Sierra Designs Flashlight 1 tent is a solo backpacking tent for outdoor adventurers who believe that comfort and simplicity shouldn't be mutually exclusive. Hybrid double/single wall design reduces weight and helps ensure quick, dry setup. Leave the tent poles behind and use trekking poles (sold separately) instead to reduce minimum weight. Large door creates an open, airy feel. Awning with 8-in. overhang provides dry entry and exit as well as shade from the sun; it lets you leave the door open, even when it's raining. Gear closet lets you store gear where it should be-away from the door. With only 6 stakeout points, the Sierra Designs Flashlight 1 Tent boasts easy setup and eliminates the restaking associated with most tarp tents and trekking pole shelters.","short_description":"The 3-season Sierra Designs Flashlight 1 tent is a solo backpacking tent for outdoor adventurers who believe that comfort and simplicity shouldn't be mutually exclusive.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Tents","product_group":"Backpacking Tents","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s424095.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l424095.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=424095&tt=df","retail_price":"219.95","sale_price":"219.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=424095\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m424095.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=865167&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8651670001":{"sku":"8651670001","vendor_sku":"40151314","upc":"054003745048","color":"SD TAN/SD BLUE","retail_price":"219.95","sale_price":"219.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","tents","backpacking-tents"]}
