{"sku":"785548","manufacturer_id":"01.6815.0071","brand_name":"Old Town","product_name":"Old Town Royalex Tripper 172 Canoe","long_description":"The Old Town Tripper 172 canoe excels on multiday trips thanks to its high-volume and balanced hull design. You'll be paddling with ease, even if the load is heavy. A high carrying capacity makes this canoe well-suited for day trips or family outings for either solo or tandem paddlers. Royalex(R) hull provides exceptional abrasion resistance and springs back from impacts. Royalex also makes a much lighter weight hull than standard polyethylene and offers excellent strength and toughness. Moderate rocker provides excellent maneuverability in rapids; flared sides provide dryness, buoyancy and secondary stability. Deep-V hull offers excellent tracking on flat water and stability on moving water and waves. Stout ash thwart, ash carrying yoke and vinyl-wrapped gunwales enhance rigidity. Features polyethylene decks, contoured seats, and grab loops.","short_description":"The Old Town Tripper 172 canoe excels on multiday trips thanks to its high-volume and balanced hull design.
