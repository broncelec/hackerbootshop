{"sku":"862154","manufacturer_id":"CM2002MD02","brand_name":"Cannondale","product_name":"Cannondale Adventure 3 Bike - 2014","long_description":"Designed for comfort, the Cannondale Adventure 3 bike offers a relaxed riding position and a cushioned ride, making it great for casual jaunts through the park or exploring new paths. Aluminum frame puts you in a very comfortable riding position so you won't strain to reach the handlebars, look around or pedal. The low stand-over height makes it a cinch to quickly hop on or off the bike. Cushy suspension fork supplies 50mm of travel to help smooth out the rough spots on city streets and bike paths. With a flick of the wrist, Shimano twist shifters guide the derailleurs between the 24 gear combinations for quick, easy shifting. Chainring guard helps keep clothes clean and out of the chain. Riser handlebar and tool-free adjustable stem let you easily dial in a relaxed, upright riding position. Ultra Comfort saddle with spring suspension offers anatomic shaping to enhance comfort; suspension seatpost takes the edge off road vibrations and bumps. Platform pedals accept most shoes-just get on and go. Specs on the Cannondale Adventure 3 bike are subject to change.","short_description":"Designed for comfort, the Cannondale Adventure 3 bike offers a relaxed riding position and a cushioned ride, making it great for casual jaunts through the park or exploring new paths.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bikes","product_group":"Hybrid Bikes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s378519.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l378519.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=378519&tt=df","retail_price":"479.00","sale_price":"479.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=378519\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m378519.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=862154&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8621540001":{"sku":"8621540001","vendor_sku":"CM2002SM02","upc":"884603522455","size":"S","color":"CHARCOAL GREY MATTE","retail_price":"479.00","sale_price":"479.00"},"8621540002":{"sku":"8621540002","vendor_sku":"CM2002MD02","upc":"884603522462","size":"M","color":"CHARCOAL GREY MATTE","retail_price":"479.00","sale_price":"479.00"},"8621540003":{"sku":"8621540003","vendor_sku":"CM2002LG02","upc":"884603522479","size":"L","color":"CHARCOAL GREY MATTE","retail_price":"479.00","sale_price":"479.00"},"8621540004":{"sku":"8621540004","vendor_sku":"CM2002XL02","upc":"884603522486","size":"XL","color":"CHARCOAL GREY MATTE","retail_price":"479.00","sale_price":"479.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bikes","hybrid-bikes"]}
