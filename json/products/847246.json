{"sku":"847246","manufacturer_id":"815","brand_name":"Ally","product_name":" Ally 17 DR Foldable Canoe","long_description":"Easy to store and ready for adventure wherever water flows, the Ally 17 DR foldable canoe offers substantial benefits as an alternative to hard-shell canoes. Suited to flatwater, the tumblehome shape and straight keel enhances tracking and adds side-to-side stability. Perfect for 2 paddlers, this foldable canoe has enough gear-holding capacity for multiday expeditions. The Ally 17 DR foldable canoe assembles without special tools or skills; when collapsed, it can be stored in a 42 x 24 x 18 in. space (storage sack not included). PVC-skin won't crack if you scrape an unexpected rock, and foam bottom mat is soft on knees and provides an additional source of protection. 6082 T6 aluminum frame is strong, lightweight and corrosion-resistant. Plastic, molded seat can be adjusted for sitting or kneeling positions and for adjusting the canoe's trim. 45 lb. weight means you'll have an easy time portaging, and the flexible feel to the boat means you'll glide easily over chop and waves. Package includes canoe (skin, seats, foam mat, chines, keel, ribs, gunwales, bow and stern), a mallet for assembly and a repair kit. Approximate setup time is 30 min. with 2 people; 1 hr. with a single person.","short_description":"Easy to store and ready for adventure wherever water flows, the Ally 17 DR foldable canoe offers substantial benefits as an alternative to hard-shell canoes.","category":"Paddling","subcategory":"Canoeing","product_group":"Canoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s430363.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l430363.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=430363&tt=df","retail_price":"2173.00","sale_price":"2173.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=430363\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m430363.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=847246&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8472460001":{"sku":"8472460001","vendor_sku":"815","size":"17 FT","color":"RED","retail_price":"2173.00","sale_price":"2173.00"}},"categories":["paddling","canoeing","canoes"]}
