{"sku":"860316","manufacturer_id":"113324.193","brand_name":"Volkl","product_name":"Volkl Shiro Skis - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Volkl Shiro skis bring jumbo 119mm waists and full rocker to play on powder, but they also charge onto soft snow and groomers with gusto. Full rocker increases maneuverability in deep snow, making turns in powder effortless and adding a surflike, floaty feel. The smooth, gradual rocker from tip to tail also creates uninterrupted edge contact on groomed runs so you can deftly maneuver these wide-waisted powder skis back to the lifts. Multilayer wooden core uses dense ash under the bindings to ensure screws won't come loose during harsh landings. Soft poplar in the remainder of the skis makes them snappy and responsive. Tough Box construction sheathes the wood core in composite and fiberglass to remain durable during high speed landings and to snap back quickly from aggressive turns. Carbon laminate in the bottom layer of the core stabilizes the ride and further enhances durability. Stiff flex zone in front adds stability, and medium flex underfoot transitions to the soft tail that aids in turning on groomers and maneuvering in pow. Directional twin tip heavily favors skiing forward but allows you to ski and land jumps backward if needed. Volkl Shiro skis require bindings with wide brakes. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.","short_description":"Volkl Shiro skis bring jumbo 119mm waists and full rocker to play on powder, but they also charge onto soft snow and groomers with gusto.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382259.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382259.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382259&tt=df","retail_price":"699.00","sale_price":"499.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382259\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382259.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=860316&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8603160003":{"sku":"8603160003","vendor_sku":"113324.193","upc":"821264528280","size":"193 CM","retail_price":"499.83","sale_price":"499.83"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
