Pad incorporates a patent-pending welded-nylon grid of chambers for high warmth and low weight. Working together with the reflective layer, the innovative construction creates over 100 internal cells that trap warm air and return heat to your body for year-round warmth. Innovative baffling creates an internal truss system that minimizes the movement of air. Shift less and rest better! Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XLite sleeping pad includes a stuff sack and repair kit.","short_description":"Once again shattering the ceiling of low weight, surprising warmth and packability, the Therm-a-Rest NeoAir XLite sleeping pad sets a new standard for gram-counting backpackers and adventure racers.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Pads, Cots And Hammocks","product_group":"Sleeping Pads","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s422163.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l422163.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=422163&tt=df","keywords":"mats,mattress","retail_price":"179.95","sale_price":"179.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=422163\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m422163.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=829851&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8298510001":{"sku":"8298510001","vendor_sku":"06645","upc":"040818066454","size":"S","color":"RADIANT YELLOW","retail_price":"129.95","sale_price":"129.95"},"8298510002":{"sku":"8298510002","vendor_sku":"06647","upc":"040818066478","size":"Regular","color":"RADIANT YELLOW","retail_price":"159.95","sale_price":"159.95"},"8298510003":{"sku":"8298510003","upc":"040818066485","size":"L","color":"RADIANT YELLOW","retail_price":"179.95","sale_price":"179.95"}}}
