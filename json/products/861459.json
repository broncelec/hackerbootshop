{"sku":"861459","manufacturer_id":"A14-283-1-13","brand_name":"Marin","product_name":"Marin Bolinas Ridge Hydro Bike - 2014","long_description":"The Marin Bolinas Ridge Hydro hardtail mountain bike features a 100mm suspension fork and a tough frame for handling singletrack bliss with ease. Double-butted aluminum frame delivers a stiff, responsive ride; hydroformed top and down tubes maintain strength while reducing overall weight. SR Suntour XCM-HLO suspension fork provides 100mm of travel to smooth out rough trails and can be locked out when suspension isn't needed. Snap through the 27 gear combinations with the Shimano Acera trigger shifters and tackle hilly terrain and fast descents. Tektro HDM-300 Hydraulic Disc brakes facilitate easy speed management as well as outright stopping power thanks to a 180mm rotor up front and a 160mm rotor in the back. Schwalbe Black Jack 26 in. tires offer fast-rolling traction with good cornering bite. Specs on the Marin Bolinas Ridge Hydro hardtail mountain bike are subject to change.","short_description":"The Marin Bolinas Ridge Hydro hardtail mountain bike features a 100mm suspension fork and a tough frame for handling singletrack bliss with ease.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bikes","product_group":"Mountain Bikes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s374787.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l374787.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=374787&tt=df","retail_price":"699.00","sale_price":"699.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=374787\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m374787.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=861459&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8614590005":{"sku":"8614590005","vendor_sku":"A14-283-1-20","upc":"841323011355","size":"20.5 IN","color":"MATTE CHARCOAL","retail_price":"699.00","sale_price":"699.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bikes","mountain-bikes"]}
