Alloy exoskeleton works along with the internal roll cage to supply reinforcement across the vent bridges. Rear retention harness customizes sizing with a single, micro-adjusting dial; plush EVA padding doesn't absorb moisture or odors. Comfortable webbing straps with cam-lock dividers offer easy, secure adjustment for a personalized fit.
