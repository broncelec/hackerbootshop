{"sku":"857902","manufacturer_id":"B130301702085","brand_name":"K2","product_name":" K2 Contour Snowboard Boots - Women's - 2013/2014","long_description":"The high-end K2 Contour women's snowboard boots feature the Boa(R) Conda(TM) liner lacing system to lock down your heels, giving you amazing control when ripping turns all over the mountain. Internal and external Boa lacing personalizes liner and shell fit while shock-absorbing Harshmellow padding soaks up the speed bumps. Intuition(TM) Control Foam 3D-stitched liners feature dual-density Ultralon(R), a flexible thermal-formable EVA foam designed to resist pressure-related pack out. Internal and external J-bars hold heels securely; highly-supportive liner bottoms include molded, dual EVA insoles with Harshmellow pods for extra damping and support. K2 Boa Conda liner lacing system allows on-the-fly control of ankle support and heel hold while the shells are still fully laced by external Boa reels. Smooth-functioning Boa reels anchor shells and liners together for perfect alignment; harness lacing through the floating tongue allows a personalized fit. Dual-density, 3D-formed tongues prevent pressure points on legs. Boa(R) Coiler shell lacing, with ankle and cable guides along entire edge of eyestays, distributes closure force evenly for a dialed-in fit that won't loosen up. The Coiler scoops up loose cable when entering as well as exiting the boot; put your foot in, pull back on the tongue, twist the reel a few times and you're off. Grip-Light outsoles are constructed of super lightweight Phylon with areas of rubber and cushioned Harshmellow for lightweight support and superior traction.","short_description":"The high-end K2 Contour women's snowboard boots feature the Boa(R) Conda(TM) liner lacing system to lock down your heels, giving you amazing control when ripping turns all over the mountain.","category":"Snowboarding","subcategory":"Snowboard Boots","product_group":"Women's Snowboard Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s441403.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l441403.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=441403&tt=df","retail_price":"279.95","sale_price":"193.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=441403\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m441403.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=857902&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8579020002":{"sku":"8579020002","vendor_sku":"B130301702060","upc":"886745186410","size":"6","color":"GREY","retail_price":"193.83","sale_price":"193.83"},"8579020003":{"sku":"8579020003","vendor_sku":"B130301702065","upc":"886745186427","size":"6.5","color":"GREY","retail_price":"193.83","sale_price":"193.83"},"8579020004":{"sku":"8579020004","vendor_sku":"B130301702070","upc":"886745186434","size":"7","color":"GREY","retail_price":"193.83","sale_price":"193.83"},"8579020005":{"sku":"8579020005","vendor_sku":"B130301702075","upc":"886745186441","size":"7.5","color":"GREY","retail_price":"193.83","sale_price":"193.83"},"8579020006":{"sku":"8579020006","vendor_sku":"B130301702080","upc":"886745186458","size":"8","color":"GREY","retail_price":"193.83","sale_price":"193.83"},"8579020007":{"sku":"8579020007","vendor_sku":"B130301702085","upc":"886745186465","size":"8.5","color":"GREY","retail_price":"193.83","sale_price":"193.83"},"8579020008":{"sku":"8579020008","vendor_sku":"B130301702090","upc":"886745186472","size":"9","color":"GREY","retail_price":"193.83","sale_price":"193.83"},"8579020009":{"sku":"8579020009","vendor_sku":"B130301702100","upc":"886745186489","size":"10","color":"GREY","retail_price":"193.83","sale_price":"193.83"}}}
