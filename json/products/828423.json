THERMOLITE(R) Quallofil synthetic insulation offers minimal bulkiness and excellent packability, yet provides warmth even when wet. Ripstop nylon shell features a Durable Water Repellent finish that causes moisture to bead up and roll off; soft cotton/polyester lining resists stains. Underside insulation has been eliminated and replaced with a sleeve for one 78 x 50 in. pad or two 78 x 25 in. pads (sold separately). Draft wedge insulates the connection between the bag and pad to prevent cold air from entering. Built-in pillow pocket for each person lets you stuff a jacket or a pillow inside. Draft collar for each person keeps cold air from sneaking in around the neck; no-draft flap running down the inside center of the bag keeps heat compartmentalized. Zippers on each side allow easy access for both sleepers; draft tubes back zippers to prevent warm air from escaping and cold air from entering. Internal loops allow attachment of a sleeping bag liner, sold separately. Big Agnes Dream Island sleeping bag comes with a nylon stuff sack and cotton storage bag.","short_description":"This spacious Dream Island double bag by Big Agnes is designed to sleep 2 people comfortably, offering the same great features as a single Big Agnes sleeping bag.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags And Accessories","product_group":"Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s421275.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l421275.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=421275&tt=df","keywords":"compact","retail_price":"219.95","sale_price":"219.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=421275\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m421275.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=828423&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8284230001":{"sku":"8284230001","vendor_sku":"BDWDI12","upc":"873840008631","color":"RUST/COAL","retail_price":"219.95","sale_price":"219.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sleeping-bags-and-accessories","sleeping-bags"]}
