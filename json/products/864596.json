{"sku":"864596","manufacturer_id":"033938-505-1-SM","brand_name":"Osprey","product_name":"Osprey Exos 38 Pack","long_description":"Osprey Exos packs have become a standard among thru-hikers and ultralight enthusiasts. The supportive Exos 38 Pack is no exception, and is perfect for superlight backpacking and day hiking. Updated materials and hardware provide a lighter weight pack than the previous version; the lid, key straps and attachment points are all removable. Superlight Airspeed(TM) suspension features a 6065 aluminum frame and breathable 3D tensioned-mesh back panel with side ventilation. ExoForm(TM) shoulder straps include a stretch-mesh energy gel pocket and a 15mm adjustable slide sternum strap with a built-in whistle. ExoForm hipbelt features an ergonomic, forward-pull cinch closure that lets you get just the right fit; seamless layered mesh provides comfort and cushioning. Removable floating lid includes top and under-lid zippered pockets for stashing trail essentials within easy reach. FlapJacket(TM) lid deploys to provide main compartment protection from the elements and top-down compression to keep the pack load stable. Hydration-compatible design places the reservoir (sold separately) in a cavity behind the back panel for easy refilling. Ultralight, 7mm webbing compression straps on the sides take up extra volume with minimal added weight; route the straps over or under the side pockets. Sleeping-pad straps and a single tool attachment with bungee tie-off let you strap extra gear to the outside of the pack. Front and side stretch woven pockets provide handy spots for stuffing a rain jacket or water bottle; zippered hipbelt pockets give you a place to stash energy food. The Osprey Exos 38 Pack is made with 100-denier nylon and ripstop nylon for ultralight durability.","short_description":"Osprey Exos packs have become a standard among thru-hikers and ultralight enthusiasts.
