{"sku":"865309","manufacturer_id":"40151514","brand_name":"Sierra Designs","product_name":"Sierra Designs Flash 2 Tent","long_description":"The fusion of luxury and light weight come together perfectly in the 2-person, 3-season Sierra Designs Flash 2 Tent. It defies belief about how light a full-size, full-featured shelter can be. Hybrid double/single wall reduces weight and provides quick, dry setup, even in the rain; freestanding design can be pitched anywhere, no matter how impenetrable the surface. Symmetric dome shape allows for both head-to-head and head-to-toe sleeping configurations; high ceiling accommodates thicker mattresses with plenty of headroom. Immense interior space allows occupants to sit at either end with room in between for a comfortable game of cards. The Sierra Designs Flash 2 Tent features 2 drop doors that are uncommonly wide and large enough for 2 people to sit side by side. DAC Pressfit(R) poles feature a securely fixed, pressed-in ferrule, ensuring the poles will remain strong and reliable. 15 in. integrated awning poles maximize the door openings and drip lines without the extra weight of an additional support pole. 2 gear closets store gear away from the door; gear closets help keep gear dry in a rainstorm, whether closed or left open for additional venting.","short_description":"The fusion of luxury and light weight come together perfectly in the 2-person, 3-season Sierra Designs Flash 2 Tent.
