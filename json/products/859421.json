{"sku":"859421","manufacturer_id":"05054201 576","brand_name":"Nordica","product_name":" Nordica Cruise 80 Ski Boots - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Built with very roomy lasts and a soft flex for beginning skiers, Nordica Cruise 80 ski boots emphasize comfort so you can really enjoy your time on the mountain. The Nordica Cruise 80 ski boots feature extra-wide lasts that accommodate a forefoot measurement up to 104mm for a generous fit. With a flex index of 80, Nordica Cruise 80 ski boots provide soft resistance against a forward lean, appropriate for most beginning skiers. Hand-stitched liners snugly wrap feet in cushioning foam and offer large toe boxes to improve circulation and warmth; closed-cell foam against the shells enhances warmth. Footbeds optimize foot position to create an effortless skiing stance, and they offer easy support for comfortable wear all day long. Upper buckle features a ladder that changes position to ease closure of the top portion of the boot; ladder position can be changed without the use of tools. Top of the boot a little tight? Cuffs feature an adjustable hex nut that increases the circumference of the top of the boot by 3 - 5mm and relaxes the angle of the boots. Nordica Cruise 80 ski boots feature power straps that adjust the cuffs for snugness and pressure against the shins.","short_description":"Built with very roomy lasts and a soft flex for beginning skiers, Nordica Cruise 80 ski boots emphasize comfort so you can really enjoy your time on the mountain.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Downhill Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382591.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382591.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382591&tt=df","retail_price":"249.00","sale_price":"173.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382591\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382591.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859421&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8594210001":{"sku":"8594210001","vendor_sku":"05054201 576","upc":"885315623119","size":"Mondo 25.5","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"173.83","sale_price":"173.83"},"8594210002":{"sku":"8594210002","vendor_sku":"05054201 576","upc":"885315623133","size":"Mondo 26.5","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"173.83","sale_price":"173.83"},"8594210004":{"sku":"8594210004","vendor_sku":"05054201 576","upc":"885315623171","size":"Mondo 28.5","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"173.83","sale_price":"173.83"},"8594210005":{"sku":"8594210005","vendor_sku":"05054201 576","upc":"885315623195","size":"Mondo 29.5","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"173.83","sale_price":"173.83"}}}
