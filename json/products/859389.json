{"sku":"859389","manufacturer_id":"RBC2070","brand_name":"Rossignol","product_name":" Rossignol Synergy Sensor2 80 Ski Boots - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"With a soft flex and forgiving fit at the insteps and toes, the Rossignol Synergy Sensor2 80 ski boots enhance circulation and warmth for comfort while you get up to speed with your skiing skills. The Rossignol Synergy Sensor2 80 ski boots place a premium on comfort using liners that address common fit issues of pressure on the insteps and cramped toes. Specially designed insteps provide excellent midfoot fit, resulting in heightened responsiveness, increased circulation and greater warmth. One-piece toe box and tongue eliminates seams and overlaps in the tongue attachment area, reducing pressure points at the instep and top of the toes. Roomy 102mm footbeds offer excellent comfort. Stiff polycarbonate inserts under big toe, little toe and heel works with the shells to transfer energy to the ski. Foam padding in the liner resists packing out; smooth contours and an anatomic fit eliminate pressure points. Tongue loops aid in putting the boots on and taking them off. 4 magnesium buckles feature a diagonal pull design to set the foot securely into the heel pocket and enhance shell wrap. With a soft flex index of 80, Rossignol Synergy Sensor2 80 ski boots provide light resistance against a forward lean, appropriate for progressing beginning skiers.","short_description":"With a soft flex and forgiving fit at the insteps and toes, the Rossignol Synergy Sensor2 80 ski boots enhance circulation and warmth for comfort while you get up to speed with your skiing skills.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Downhill Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382567.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382567.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382567&tt=df","retail_price":"299.95","sale_price":"239.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382567\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382567.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859389&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8593890001":{"sku":"8593890001","vendor_sku":"RBC2070","size":"Mondo 26.5","color":"BLACK/BLUE","retail_price":"239.93","sale_price":"239.93"},"8593890002":{"sku":"8593890002","vendor_sku":"RBC2070","size":"Mondo 27.5","color":"BLACK/BLUE","retail_price":"239.93","sale_price":"239.93"},"8593890003":{"sku":"8593890003","vendor_sku":"RBC2070","size":"Mondo 28.5","color":"BLACK/BLUE","retail_price":"239.93","sale_price":"239.93"},"8593890004":{"sku":"8593890004","vendor_sku":"RBC2070","size":"Mondo 29.5","color":"BLACK/BLUE","retail_price":"239.93","sale_price":"239.93"}}}
