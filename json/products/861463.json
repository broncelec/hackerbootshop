{"sku":"861463","manufacturer_id":"A14-245-1-17","brand_name":"Marin","product_name":" Marin Nail Trail 27.5\" Bike - 2014","long_description":"Built with high-performance components and 27.5 in. wheels for quick acceleration and excellent control, the Marin Nail Trail 27.5 mountain bike is ready for the ups and downs of tough trails. Marin Nail Trail 27.5 mountain bike is quicker and lighter than 29ers, but offers the same benefits of large-diameter wheels-more speed and better traction. Larger-diameter wheels also roll over obstacles more easily so you won't stall going up hill over roots and loose soil. Aluminum frame is triple-butted to minimize weight while increasing strength and torsional rigidity; seat and chain stays are double-butted. Shimano hydraulic disc brakes provide ample stopping power (7 in. rotor up front, 6 in. in the back) no matter how steep the terrain or how wet the weather. Rock Shox Reba RL 15mm Maxle-light fork allows 100mm travel with rebound adjustment, lockout and solo air preload so you can adjust for unexpected trail obstacles. Shimano SLX front and XT Shadow Plus rear derailleurs provide instant shifting as you need it, controlled by Shimano SLX shifters. 20 gears offer easy cruising up and down your favorite mountain trail, and Shimano Deore crankset powers the 11-36 10-speed cassette. Please note pedals are not included with the Marin Nail Trail 27.5 mountain bike.","short_description":"Built with high-performance components and 27.5 in. wheels for quick acceleration and excellent control, the Marin Nail Trail 27.5 mountain bike is ready for the ups and downs of tough trails.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bikes","product_group":"Mountain Bikes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s374803.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l374803.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=374803&tt=df","retail_price":"1699.00","sale_price":"1699.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=374803\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m374803.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=861463&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{},"extended_xml_attributes":"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t","categories":["cycling","bikes","mountain-bikes"]}
