Vans Double Boa(R) lacing features 2 fit zones that tighten independently; they tighten over the instep and hold the heel securely no matter how tight the upper is cranked. TriFit-X thermal liners feature asymmetric X-Cage inserts that lock your heels in place; low-volume soles help you feel connected to the board. Fleece-lined upper cuffs offer warmth; flexible toe boxes help the boots feel more like shoes when you're walking or hiking. Cuffs flex easily for enhanced board control when carving; wrap-around design offers a secure closure around your ankles and calves. Instep articulation offers a forgiving forward flex that maintains support. Molded EVA footbeds feature integrated arch support and dual-density metatarsal and heel impact-relief pads. Cushioned rubber outsoles feature an inverted waffle tread patten design for increased traction.","short_description":"As top performing snowboard boots from Vans, the Aura boots feature classic Vans styling, a forgiving flex, articulated cuffs and the Double Boa(R) lacing system for a dialed fit.","category":"Snowboarding","subcategory":"Snowboard Boots","product_group":"Men's Snowboard Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s383107.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l383107.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=383107&tt=df","retail_price":"249.95","sale_price":"160.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=383107\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m383107.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=857737&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8577370001":{"sku":"8577370001","vendor_sku":"VN-0NFEY38","upc":"887682047093","size":"9","color":"GRAY/BLACK","retail_price":"160.83","sale_price":"160.83"},"8577370002":{"sku":"8577370002","vendor_sku":"VN-0NFEY38","upc":"887682047086","size":"9.5","color":"GRAY/BLACK","retail_price":"160.83","sale_price":"160.83"},"8577370005":{"sku":"8577370005","vendor_sku":"VN-0NFEY38","upc":"887682046973","size":"11","color":"GRAY/BLACK","retail_price":"160.83","sale_price":"160.83"},"8577370006":{"sku":"8577370006","vendor_sku":"VN-0NFEY38","upc":"887682046980","size":"11.5","color":"GRAY/BLACK","retail_price":"160.83","sale_price":"160.83"},"8577370007":{"sku":"8577370007","vendor_sku":"VN-0NFEY38","upc":"887682046997","size":"12","color":"GRAY/BLACK","retail_price":"160.83","sale_price":"160.83"}},"categories":["snow","snowboard-boots","mens-snowboard-boots"]}
