{"sku":"859235","manufacturer_id":"L35453500","brand_name":"Salomon","product_name":" Salomon Q-90 Skis - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"An all-mountain powerhouse that takes on terrain with confidence, the Salomon Q-90 skis use rockered tips and tails and a light wood core to take intermediate off-piste skills to the next level. Rockered profile excels in soft snow and delivers fluid performance on hardpack; when put on edge, 95% of edge length contacts the snow for precision on groomed runs. Full wood core delivers direct transmission of power with precision and efficiency. Elastomer inserts placed over the edges absorb vibrations, resulting in a smooth ride that softens ski-to-snow contact. Fiber reinforcements laid directly on the edges add torsional rigidity and improve edge durability, and wide metal edges withstand big impacts and improve shock resistance. The Salomon Q-90 skis require bindings with wide brakes. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.","short_description":"An all-mountain powerhouse that takes on terrain with confidence, the Salomon Q-90 skis use rockered tips and tails and a light wood core to take intermediate off-piste skills to the next level.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s381987.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l381987.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=381987&tt=df","retail_price":"449.00","sale_price":"358.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=381987\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m381987.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859235&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8592350001":{"sku":"8592350001","vendor_sku":"L35453500","upc":"080694685127","size":"169 CM","color":"RED/BLACK/WHITE","retail_price":"358.93","sale_price":"358.93"},"8592350002":{"sku":"8592350002","vendor_sku":"L35453500","upc":"080694685103","size":"177 CM","color":"RED/BLACK/WHITE","retail_price":"358.93","sale_price":"358.93"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
