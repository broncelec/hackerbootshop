{"sku":"809711","manufacturer_id":"13292","brand_name":"Novara","product_name":" Novara Metro Gel Road Bike Shorts - Men's","long_description":"If your riding consists of tour de farms instead of Tour de France, let the Novara Metro Gel bike shorts deliver comfort for your day in the saddle. 4-way stretch fabric and 6-panel construction provide support for hard-working muscles; moisture-wicking, quick-drying finish increases comfort. Novara Gel chamois conforms to body contours; a top layer of breathable foam and a bottom layer of thin, resilient foam enhances comfort on the bike. Full-coverage Novara Gel chamois features a perforated, breathable gel pad for cushion; microfiber cover wicks moisture away. Gel pad system dissipates shock and reduces skin irritation by forming a fluid barrier between the hard saddle shell and the cyclist. Ultrasoft, breathable chamois is elasticized for flex and stretch. Silicone elastic grippers keep hems from riding up. Reflective accents increase visibility. With a UPF 50+ rating, fabric provides excellent protection against harmful ultraviolet rays.","short_description":"If your riding consists of tour de farms instead of Tour de France, let the Novara Metro Gel bike shorts deliver comfort for your day in the saddle.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Cycling Clothing","product_group":"Bike Shorts","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s390615.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l390615.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=390615&tt=df","retail_price":"54.50","sale_price":"54.50","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=390615\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m390615.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=809711&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8097110020":{"sku":"8097110020","vendor_sku":"13292","upc":"480971100204","size":"M","color":"Black","retail_price":"54.50","sale_price":"54.50"},"8097110038":{"sku":"8097110038","vendor_sku":"13292","upc":"480971100389","size":"L","color":"BLUE","retail_price":"54.50","sale_price":"54.50"},"8097110046":{"sku":"8097110046","vendor_sku":"13292","upc":"480971100464","size":"Xl","color":"BLUE","retail_price":"54.50","sale_price":"54.50"}},"categories":["cycling","cycling-clothing","bike-shorts"]}
