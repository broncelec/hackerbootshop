{"sku":"869545","manufacturer_id":"120 342 515","brand_name":"Native Eyewear","product_name":"Native Eyewear Hardtop XP Polarized Sunglasses - Men's","long_description":"The Native Eyewear Hardtop XP Polarized Sunglasses come with 2 pairs of lenses for bright or low light, and they are 20% larger than the regular Hardtop sunglasses for more protection. Includes one set of polarized brown lenses for bright sun and one set of SportFlex(TM) lenses for low light, for a total of 2 sets of lenses. SportFlex orange-yellow lenses have a blue mirror coating suitable for a range of low-light conditions from cloudy, overcast, dusk and dawn. A unique interchangeable lens system lets you switch lenses without smudging the surfaces with fingerprints. Polarized Crystal Carbonate(R) lenses have the strongest hard coating available to protect against scratching. Rhyno-Tuff(R) AIR frames endure extreme highs and lows in temperature. Cam-action spring hinges allow the temples to quickly lock into position. P.C.C.(R) lenses pass the rigorous ANSI Z80.3 tests for optical clarity and impact resistance while blocking 100% of harmful UVA and UVB light. Self-adjusting Cushinol(TM) nosepads and ear stems create a nonslip grip that keeps sunglasses in place. Frame venting eliminates fog and condensation. The Native Eyewear Hardtop XP Polarized Sunglasses best fit a large to extra-large profile. Sunglasses come with a semi-rigid zippered case and a soft pouch that doubles as a cleaning cloth.","short_description":"The Native Eyewear Hardtop XP Polarized Sunglasses come with 2 pairs of lenses for bright or low light, and they are 20% larger than the regular Hardtop sunglasses for more protection.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sunglasses","product_group":"Sport Sunglasses","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s452711.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l452711.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=452711&tt=df","keywords":"Cycling","retail_price":"129.00","sale_price":"129.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=452711\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m452711.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=869545&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8695450001":{"sku":"8695450001","vendor_sku":"120 342 515","upc":"764824011702","size":"BROWN","color":"MAPLE TORT","retail_price":"129.00","sale_price":"129.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sunglasses","sport-sunglasses"]}
