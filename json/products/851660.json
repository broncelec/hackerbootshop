{"sku":"851660","manufacturer_id":"4371221","brand_name":"Julbo","product_name":" Julbo Trek Sunglasses - Men's","long_description":"The Julbo Trek sunglasses offer optimum performance in extreme environments, whether running over a mountain pass or climbing up a glacier at high altitude. Lightweight and virtually shatterproof, polycarbonate lenses are 20 times more impact resistant than glass and one-third the weight. Full ventilation helps prevent fogging. Lightweight, tough nylon frames feature flexible temples that allow sunglasses to fit various face shapes naturally. Adjustable, shockproof nose pads and temples become tacky as you perspire, reducing slippage. Side shields block light coming from the sides; can be removed as needed. Includes an adjustable neck strap. Julbo Trek sunglasses include a protective case for storage.","short_description":"The Julbo Trek sunglasses offer optimum performance in extreme environments, whether running over a mountain pass or climbing up a glacier at high altitude.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sunglasses","product_group":"Sport Sunglasses","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s423239.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l423239.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=423239&tt=df","keywords":"Cycling","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=423239\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m423239.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=851660&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8516600001":{"sku":"8516600001","vendor_sku":"4371221","size":"SPECTRON 4","color":"GREY/RED","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"}}}
