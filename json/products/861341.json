{"sku":"861341","manufacturer_id":"OM4782-470","brand_name":"Mountain Hardwear","product_name":" Mountain Hardwear Hooded Compressor Jacket - Men's - 2012","long_description":"Grab this classic for alpine and mixed-route climbing. The 2012 Mountain Hardwear Hooded Compressor Jacket offers superb warmth in very cold conditions without extra bulk or weight. 100g Thermic Micro TK midweight synthetic insulation (even in the hood!) makes this a great choice for cold heights where you don't quite need a full-on down parka. Zippered handwarmer pockets are placed to stay out of the way of a harness and pack straps. Dual drawcords at the hem and inner stretch cuffs seal in warmth. Hood has easy, single-pull adjustment. Wear the Mountain Hardwear Hooded Compressor jacket by itself when climbing and enduring cold belays, or under a shell in windier, colder or wetter conditions.","short_description":"Grab this classic for alpine and mixed-route climbing.
