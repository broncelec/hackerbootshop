{"sku":"832641","manufacturer_id":"7541","brand_name":"Nikon","product_name":" Nikon Monarch 3 10 x 42 Waterproof Binoculars","long_description":"The Nikon Monarch 3 10 x 42 binoculars feature powerful magnification and bright, high-resolution views from the first light of dawn until the last glimmer of dusk. Phase-corrected, highly reflective silver-alloy multicoatings on the prisms offer clear, high-contrast images that preserve accurate colors. Fully multicoated lenses deliver enhanced brightness and resolution. Ergonomic styling is mated with a rubber-armored exterior, providing added shock resistance and a firm grip whether wet or dry. Large, central focus wheel and adjustable diopter make focus easy to achieve and maintain, even while wearing gloves. Click-stop rubber eyecups, complemented by long eye relief, allow the binoculars to be used comfortably when wearing glasses. Nikon Monarch 3 10 x 42 binoculars are O-ring sealed and nitrogen-purged for waterproof, fogproof performance; flip-down objective-lens covers help protect optics.","short_description":"The Nikon Monarch 3 10 x 42 binoculars feature powerful magnification and bright, high-resolution views from the first light of dawn until the last glimmer of dusk.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Gadgets","product_group":"Binoculars And Optics","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s417927.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l417927.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=417927&tt=df","retail_price":"280.00","sale_price":"280.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=417927\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m417927.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=832641&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8326410001":{"sku":"8326410001","vendor_sku":"7541","upc":"018208075416","size":"10 X 42","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"280.00","sale_price":"280.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","gadgets","binoculars-and-optics"]}
