Insert the filter inline into your hydration pack drink tube (sold separately) and you can simply fill your reservoir with dirty water and drink away. Or, create one of the lightest filter systems available by attaching a drink tube (sold separately) to the filter then submerge the filter into dirty water and start sipping. When traveling overseas, use the included faucet adapter to filter water as it comes out of the tap. Hollow fiber membrane filter physically removes particles, protozoa, and bacteria down to 0.1 micron in size, including giardia, salmonella and cryptosporidium. All Sawyer water filters exceed Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommendations for removal rates.
