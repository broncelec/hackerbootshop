Machined from 7000-series aluminum; the stem is a 1-piece design with no welds or joints. New steerer clamps save about 20g of weight. Wide clamp length (48mm) and patent pending undercut around the handlebar combine to grip the handlebar more securely; provides a stiff ride with minimal flexing or squeaking. Steerer tube clamps have a large surface area and go around the steerer tube more that 180deg 2 bolts provide and extra level of security. Center tubular section is tapered with a constant wall thickness, resulting in a high stiffness-to-weight ratio and torsional rigidty. Annodized to maintain a nice appearance and prevent corrosion. Thomson logo is applied with a laser, so it will not rub off; laser marking process is specially designed to maintain the integrity of the anodization. Stack height is 40mm and rise is 0deg. X4 is engineered to work very well with both carbon handlebars and carbon steerer tubes. Every component of the stem, including the fasteners, is 100% American made.","short_description":"The Thomson Elite X4 31.8mm stem is designed to have the best combination of stiffness, light weight, strength, and durability.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Components","product_group":"Handlebars And Accessories","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s390375.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l390375.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=390375&tt=df","retail_price":"90.00","sale_price":"90.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=390375\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m390375.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=797556&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7975560033":{"sku":"7975560033","vendor_sku":"SM-E134-BK","upc":"875850002197","size":"110 Mm","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"90.00","sale_price":"90.00"}}}
