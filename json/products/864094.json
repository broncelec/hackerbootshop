{"sku":"864094","manufacturer_id":"22550-4336","brand_name":"Marmot","product_name":" Marmot Alpha Sleeping Bag","long_description":"A rugged, lightweight bag with lofty 700-fill goose down, the Marmot Alpha Sleeping Bag will provide years of 3-season use for weekend backpacking trips in the mountains. With a European Norm (EN) lower-limit rating of 27degF, the Alpha sleeping bag is suitable for 3-season use when temperatures dip just below freezing. Bag is filled with certified, lofty, lightweight 700-fill-power goose down for a great warmth-to-weight ratio. Down is treated to resist moisture to maintain warmth; treated down stays drier 10 times longer, maintains 150% more loft and dries 30% faster than untreated down. Nautilus 3D 6-baffle hood envelops your head in warmth; down gasket face muff allows hood to be cinched snug without digging into your face. Down-insulated draft collar and down-filled draft tube backing the snag-free zipper seal out cold air. Ground-level side seams eliminate cold air leaks and allow the goose down insulation to loft fully. Trapezoidal footbox is wider in the toe area and narrower in the heels to match the shape of your feet. Stretch tricot baffles allow the bag to be stuffed and unstuffed without tearing the baffle material. Zipper guards prevent zipper snags; locking zippers keep bag from opening if you toss and turn at night. Marmot Alpha Sleeping Bag comes with a storage sack. European Norm (EN) is an independent third-party temperature rating, allowing accurate comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags.","short_description":"A rugged, lightweight bag with lofty 700-fill goose down, the Marmot Alpha Sleeping Bag will provide years of 3-season use for weekend backpacking trips in the mountains.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags And Accessories","product_group":"Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s421607.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l421607.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=421607&tt=df","keywords":"compact","retail_price":"279.00","sale_price":"279.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=421607\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m421607.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=864094&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8640940001":{"sku":"8640940001","vendor_sku":"22540-4336","upc":"785562425194","size":"Regular Left","color":"GREENLAND/GREEN LICHEN","retail_price":"259.00","sale_price":"259.00"},"8640940002":{"sku":"8640940002","vendor_sku":"22550-4336","upc":"785562505230","size":"Long Left","color":"GREENLAND/GREEN LICHEN","retail_price":"279.00","sale_price":"279.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sleeping-bags-and-accessories","sleeping-bags"]}
