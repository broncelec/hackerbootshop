{"sku":"859245","manufacturer_id":"L35447700","brand_name":"Salomon","product_name":" Salomon Quest Access 80 Ski Boots - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"With a ski/hike switch to make walking around a cinch, the warm, comfortable Salomon Quest Access 80 ski boots offer very roomy lasts with extra insulation, great for beginners. 104mm lasts accommodate skiers with wide feet or beginners who want to prioritize comfort. Specialized ski/hike mechanism frees the upper cuff from the lower part of the boot to allow comfortable movement for hiking and walking. When you're ready to ski, the cuffs lock directly into the lower shells to maximize power transmission on the descent. Innovative V-shaped lower shell and magnesium backbone virtually eliminate flex when backbone is engaged. Relatively soft plastic in upper cuffs and shells makes it easy to get your feet into the boots. Comfortable liners feature a layer of custom-formable foam that personalizes the fit around the shins. Layers of wool and metallic polyester fibers boost insulation. You won't have to strain to get your boots buckled; top buckle conveniently ratchets down the cuff and offers 4cm of adjustment. With a flex index of 80, the men's Salomon Quest Access 80 ski boots provide a light flex suitable for novice skiers.","short_description":"With a ski/hike switch to make walking around a cinch, the warm, comfortable Salomon Quest Access 80 ski boots offer very roomy lasts with extra insulation, great for beginners.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Downhill Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s447791.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l447791.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=447791&tt=df","retail_price":"349.00","sale_price":"278.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=447791\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m447791.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859245&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8592450004":{"sku":"8592450004","vendor_sku":"L35447700","upc":"080694719846","size":"Mondo 28.5","color":"ORANGE/BLACK","retail_price":"278.93","sale_price":"278.93"},"8592450005":{"sku":"8592450005","vendor_sku":"L35447700","upc":"080694734122","size":"Mondo 29.5","color":"ORANGE/BLACK","retail_price":"278.93","sale_price":"278.93"}},"categories":["snow","ski-boots","downhill-ski-boots"]}
