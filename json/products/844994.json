{"sku":"844994","manufacturer_id":"110133 1D 492","brand_name":"Brooks","product_name":"Brooks Cascadia 8 Trail-Running Shoes - Men's","long_description":"The men's Brooks Cascadia 8 trail-running shoes offer aggressive trail traction and a responsive, supportive ride that can tackle ultras or quick outings through your local park's trails. Durable synthetic leather and nylon/polyester mesh uppers are lightweight and airy for quick-drying, comfortable performance. Geometric microfiber overlays wrap feet for an enhanced fit. Element air-mesh in uppers and linings provides excellent ventilation and moisture management to keep feet dry on the run; removable insoles add cushioning. DNA cushioning uses high viscosity liquid to react instantly to each step, customizing the cushion for different runners and running styles. Midsoles feature BioMoGo polymer alloy foam, which provides cushioning, energy return and reduced foot fatigue; nontoxic additive helps midsoles break down in landfills. Medial and lateral Pivot Posting system helps outsoles adapt to your stride, offering added stability on uneven surfaces and trail irregularities. Ballistic Rock Shield hardened EVA plates in forefeet help protect feet from sharp rocks. Brooks Cascadia 8 trail-running shoes feature a blend of high-density carbon rubber and recycled rubber for outstanding durability; aggressive lugs maximize grip on the trail. Outsoles also feature a special decoupled crash pad design that smooths out the landing zone throughout the heel strike.","short_description":"The men's Brooks Cascadia 8 trail-running shoes offer aggressive trail traction and a responsive, supportive ride that can tackle ultras or quick outings through your local park's trails.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Men's Footwear","product_group":"Men's Shoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s385719.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l385719.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=385719&tt=df","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=385719\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m385719.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=844994&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8449940001":{"sku":"8449940001","vendor_sku":"110133 1D 492","upc":"883439659557","size":"8","color":"BLUE/IRON/RIVER ROCK/BLAC","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8449940002":{"sku":"8449940002","vendor_sku":"110133 1D 492","upc":"883439659564","size":"8.5","color":"BLUE/IRON/RIVER ROCK/BLAC","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8449940003":{"sku":"8449940003","vendor_sku":"110133 1D 492","upc":"883439659571","size":"9","color":"BLUE/IRON/RIVER ROCK/BLAC","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8449940004":{"sku":"8449940004","vendor_sku":"110133 1D 492","upc":"883439659588","size":"9.5","color":"BLUE/IRON/RIVER ROCK/BLAC","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8449940005":{"sku":"8449940005","vendor_sku":"110133 1D 492","upc":"883439659595","size":"10","color":"BLUE/IRON/RIVER ROCK/BLAC","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8449940006":{"sku":"8449940006","vendor_sku":"110133 1D 492","upc":"883439659601","size":"10.5","color":"BLUE/IRON/RIVER ROCK/BLAC","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8449940007":{"sku":"8449940007","vendor_sku":"110133 1D 492","upc":"883439659618","size":"11","color":"BLUE/IRON/RIVER ROCK/BLAC","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8449940011":{"sku":"8449940011","vendor_sku":"110133 1D 492","upc":"883439659663","size":"14","color":"BLUE/IRON/RIVER ROCK/BLAC","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"}},"categories":["footwear","mens-footwear","mens-shoes"]}
