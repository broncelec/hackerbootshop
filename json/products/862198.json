{"sku":"862198","manufacturer_id":"CF2280SM01","brand_name":"Cannondale","product_name":"Cannondale Althea 1 Women's Bike - 2014","long_description":"An agile ride on and off the pavement, the Cannondale Althea 1 women's bike shifts from urban rides to gravel-road adventures with smooth Shimano components, disc brakes and a shock-absorbent fork. HeadShok Fatty DL50 suspension fork provides 50mm of pothole-damping suspension; suspension can be locked out when it's not needed. Shimano Alivio shifters, Acera and Deore derailleurs guide the chain through 27 smooth-shifting gear combinations to spin easily on any terrain you may encounter. Hybrid design blends the speed of a road bike with the sturdy, heads-up ride of a mountain-bike inspired frame; low stand-over height makes mounts and dismounts easy. Frame also uses Cannondale Synapse Active Vibration Elimination (S.A.V.E.) technology to damp road vibration for a smoother ride quality. Cannondale Helix 6 hydraulic disc brakes supply quick, powerful speed management in all conditions, even rain. Kenda Happy Medium tires have a fast-rolling center with aggressive outside lugs for enhanced cornering traction. Platform pedals accommodate everyday shoes-just hop on and go. Specs on the Cannondale Althea 1 women's bike are subject to change.","short_description":"An agile ride on and off the pavement, the Cannondale Althea 1 women's bike shifts from urban rides to gravel-road adventures with smooth Shimano components, disc brakes and a shock-absorbent fork.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bikes","product_group":"Hybrid Bikes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s378551.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l378551.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=378551&tt=df","retail_price":"1199.00","sale_price":"1199.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=378551\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m378551.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=862198&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8621980001":{"sku":"8621980001","vendor_sku":"CF2280SM01","upc":"884603523483","size":"Petite","color":"CHARCOAL GREY/CUCUMBER","retail_price":"1199.00","sale_price":"1199.00"},"8621980003":{"sku":"8621980003","vendor_sku":"CF2280TL01","upc":"884603523506","size":"Tall","color":"CHARCOAL GREY/CUCUMBER","retail_price":"1199.00","sale_price":"1199.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bikes","hybrid-bikes"]}
