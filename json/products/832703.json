It compresses down for storage. Reflective printing increases visibility at night to help prevent accidental tip overs. Internal stiffener gives the bowl opening a rigid form for even the biggest mouths to get in. 100% post-consumer recycled PET body fabric withstands wear and tear. Waterproof, coated nylon lining with seamless construction keeps wet food from soaking through. Drawstring closure keeps food from spilling out of bowl during transport and folds over sides when it's feeding time.
