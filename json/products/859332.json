{"sku":"859332","manufacturer_id":"S130605801153","brand_name":"K2","product_name":"K2 Superific Skis with Bindings - Women's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Looking for a fast, responsive ride on groomed runs? The K2 Superific women's skis feature rockered tips and a lively feel perfectly suited to intermediate skiers looking to get aggressive. Rockered tips initiate turns easily and offer agile performance on all kinds of terrain, and slight camber underfoot offers tenacious edge hold on firm snow. K2 women's skis reduce the bulk and weight of all components to create very lightweight skis suited to the specific needs of female skiers. Bioflex1 core combines aspen, paulownia and bamboo woods to create a lightweight ski that is stable at speed with a soft, forgiving flex. A fiberglass weave around the wood core provides torsional stiffness for highly responsive turning; a shock-absorbent secondary core smooths out your ride. Integrated binding system allows the skis to flex fully from tip to tail for smooth turn initiation, hold and release. Integrated bindings are shorter, lighter and more flexible than the men's equivalent, generating serious power and precision for female skiers. K2 Superific Skis with bindings feature DIN 3 - 10 release settings, a range suited to beginning and intermediate women skiers at medium to high speeds. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.","short_description":"Looking for a fast, responsive ride on groomed runs?
