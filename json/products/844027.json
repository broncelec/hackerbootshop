{"sku":"844027","manufacturer_id":"20173-3","brand_name":"Saucony","product_name":" Saucony Mirage 3 Road-Running Shoes - Men's","long_description":"The Saucony Mirage 3 road-running shoes prove that mild overpronators can enjoy the benefits of minimalist shoes without sacrificing support over the miles. Lightweight nylon mesh uppers with polyurethane overlays offer high breathability; moisture-wicking nylon linings help keep your feet dry, reducing susceptibility to blisters. 4mm heel-to-toe drop encourages a shorter, lower impact stride than traditional running shoes do. EVA midsoles absorb shock, cushion feet and provide gentle support; Progrid(TM) foam in heels offers incredibly lightweight cushioning. Thermoplastic urethane arc provides stability for mild overpronators or additional support to help neutral runners battle arch fatigue on long runs. Saucony Mirage 3 road-running shoes feature blown rubber outsoles that add durable cushioning for a smooth ride.","short_description":"The Saucony Mirage 3 road-running shoes prove that mild overpronators can enjoy the benefits of minimalist shoes without sacrificing support over the miles.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Men's Footwear","product_group":"Men's Shoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s385703.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l385703.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=385703&tt=df","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"74.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=385703\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m385703.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=844027&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{},"extended_xml_attributes":"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t","categories":["footwear","mens-footwear","mens-shoes"]}
