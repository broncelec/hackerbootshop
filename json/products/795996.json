{"sku":"795996","manufacturer_id":"1522352409","brand_name":"Mountain Hardwear","product_name":"Mountain Hardwear Pinole 20 Sleeping Bag","long_description":"The Mountain Hardwear 3-season Pinole 20 sleeping bag is an excellent choice for cold, demanding trips as well as car camping and backpacking trips. Soft, compressible Thermic MX(TM) fill is engineered to provide 3-dimensional, springlike loft for superior warmth and minimal weight. Offset quilt construction means no sewn-through seams and no cold spots. Warmth is optimized through differential cut of shell and lining fabrics, allowing adequate room for the insulation to expand to its full loft. Slightly wide cut gives you extra room to move inside the bag; Comfort mummy cut efficiently maximizes warmth without constriction. Tailored hood with face gasket forms around head to seal in heat. Comfort footbox allows feet to rest naturally, angled out slightly with toes pointing, while fully preserving insulation loft for maximum warmth. Insulated draft tube (backing the 2-way, full-length zipper) and insulated zipper gusset seal in heat. Antisnag construction prevents fabric from catching in the zipper; locking sliders keep the zipper in place for ventilation options. Comes with microfleece-lined stuff sack that doubles as a pillow.","short_description":"The Mountain Hardwear 3-season Pinole 20 sleeping bag is an excellent choice for cold, demanding trips as well as car camping and backpacking trips.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags And Accessories","product_group":"Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s442311.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l442311.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=442311&tt=df","keywords":"compact","retail_price":"140.00","sale_price":"140.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=442311\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m442311.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=795996&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7959960001":{"sku":"7959960001","vendor_sku":"1522352409","upc":"786559903275","size":"LONG LEFT","color":"BLUE RIDGE","retail_price":"140.00","sale_price":"140.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sleeping-bags-and-accessories","sleeping-bags"]}
