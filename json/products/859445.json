{"sku":"859445","manufacturer_id":"LBC2240","brand_name":"Lange","product_name":"Lange Exclusive RX 80 LV Ski Boots - Women's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Warm and comfortable, the women's Lange Exclusive RX 80 LV ski boots offer intermediate-level stiffness and a low-volume fit with narrow lasts. Shells, liners and narrow, 97mm footbeds are based on a composite scan of thousands of skiers' feet for anatomic accuracy and comfort. Shells are designed to create a centered, balanced stance on rockered skis to increase efficiency of technique and reduce fatigue. Control Fit liners conform to your feet for a comfortable, high-performance fit; liners may be custom molded using a heat treatment. Uniform-density plastic shells ensure highly efficient power transfer, smooth flex and finely-tuned responsiveness, even in frigid temperatures. Women-specific fit with anatomically shaped liners and upper cuffs accommodates narrow heels and low calf muscles. Liners comfortably contour your feet and precisely match the internal shape of the shells to create instant responsiveness. Specially designed insteps provide an excellent fit at the midfoot, resulting in increased circulation and greater warmth. 1-piece toe boxes and tongues eliminate seams and overlaps in the tongue-attachment areas to reduce pressure points at the insteps and tops of the toes. Soft flex index provides a power transfer suited to new intermediate skiers looking to expand their skills.","short_description":"Warm and comfortable, the women's Lange Exclusive RX 80 LV ski boots offer intermediate-level stiffness and a low-volume fit with narrow lasts.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Downhill Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382623.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382623.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382623&tt=df","retail_price":"399.95","sale_price":"399.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382623\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382623.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859445&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8594450001":{"sku":"8594450001","vendor_sku":"LBC2240","size":"Mondo 22.5","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"399.95","sale_price":"399.95"},"8594450002":{"sku":"8594450002","vendor_sku":"LBC2240","size":"Mondo 23.5","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"399.95","sale_price":"399.95"},"8594450003":{"sku":"8594450003","vendor_sku":"LBC2240","size":"Mondo 24.5","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"399.95","sale_price":"399.95"},"8594450004":{"sku":"8594450004","vendor_sku":"LBC2240","size":"Mondo 25.5","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"399.95","sale_price":"399.95"},"8594450005":{"sku":"8594450005","vendor_sku":"LBC2240","size":"Mondo 26.5","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"399.95","sale_price":"399.95"}},"categories":["snow","ski-boots","downhill-ski-boots"]}
