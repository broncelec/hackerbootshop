{"sku":"851553","manufacturer_id":"7503","brand_name":"Thule","product_name":" Thule AeroBlade Edge Roof Bar - Raised Rail","long_description":"Made specifically to accommodate vehicles with raised rails, the Thule AeroBlade Edge Raised Rail Mount roof bar is shaped to reduce noise and drag for quiet travels. Aluminum bar features a textured cover that diffuses airflow better than a smooth surface, greatly reducing wind noise. The SmartSlide(TM) system is a tape-measure-free, hassle-free molded measurement system on the underside of the bar for easy foot installation. Using a vertical load test, the AeroBlade Edge raised rail bar can sustain over 800 lbs. of force. The Thule AeroBlade Edge Raised Rail Mount roof bar includes one bar with integrated feet, preassembled; please note, does not include locks. These load bars are available in three different sizes, so be sure to refer to the Thule Fit Guide for the minimum size recommended for your specific vehicle. Size small corresponds to Thule part #7501; size medium corresponds to Thule part #7502; and size large corresponds to Thule part #7503.","short_description":"Made specifically to accommodate vehicles with raised rails, the Thule AeroBlade Edge Raised Rail Mount roof bar is shaped to reduce noise and drag for quiet travels.","category":"Car Racks","subcategory":"Base Roof Racks","product_group":"Roof Rack Cross Bars","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s408067.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l408067.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=408067&tt=df","retail_price":"179.95","sale_price":"179.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=408067\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m408067.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=851553&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8515530001":{"sku":"8515530001","vendor_sku":"7501","upc":"091021983243","size":"S","retail_price":"179.95","sale_price":"179.95"}},"categories":["car-racks","base-roof-racks","roof-rack-cross-bars"]}
