{"sku":"866946","manufacturer_id":"S4KWARMOY","brand_name":"Ticla","product_name":" Ticla Besito G.O.O.D Sleeping Bag Kit","long_description":"The Ticla Besito G.O.O.D Sleeping Bag Kit comes with a warm-weather sleeping bag and a comfy sleeping pad that stow easily in the roomy G.O.O.D. System stuff sack so you can quickly get on your way. Roomy Get Out Of Dodge (G.O.O.D.) System stuff sack is designed to hold a slightly deflated Tsubo sleeping pad around a loosely stuffed Besito bag, with room for your pillow. G.O.O.D. System makes setup and teardown a snap; toss it in the car, into the tent, catch some ZZZs, and then throw it all back in the bag and hit the road. Flip it! If it's balmy out, sleep with the warmer side of the Besito sleeping bag down; when there's a nip in the air, flip it over for a little extra insulation. Besito sleeping bag has hollow-core synthetic insulation that is rated to keep you warm down to about 30degF with the warmer side up and 45degF with the warmer side down. Soft polyester lining feels great next to skin; tapered shape keeps your feet warm without restricting them. 2-way zipper lets your feet be free and get some air; unzip the bag all the way for use as a comforter. Tsubo self-inflating sleeping pad is 2.5 in. thick for excellent comfort; nonslip material ensures you won't slip off your pad in the middle of the night. Durable construction and pad valve design minimize points of failure for a pad that will last for years to come. Small and medium-size G.O.O.D. Kits comes with medium-length pads that are 66 in. long; large-size and X-large G.O.O.D. Kits come with large-length pads that are 78 in. long. Ticla Besito G.O.O.D Sleeping Bag Kit also includes a sleeping bag stuff sack, sleeping pad stuff sack and a sleeping pad repair kit.","short_description":"The Ticla Besito G.O.O.D Sleeping Bag Kit comes with a warm-weather sleeping bag and a comfy sleeping pad that stow easily in the roomy G.O.O.D.
