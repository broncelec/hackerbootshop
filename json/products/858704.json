It's lightweight and superbright, and has multiple lighting modes to illuminate your hiking, climbing and skiing adventures. Equipped with 1 high-power LED, 2 white proximity LEDs and 2 red proximity LEDs for amazing brightness and total lighting versatility. High-quality lens tunes the light output and shape of the beam to make the Spot ideal for running, skiing, climbing, hiking, paddling and route finding in the dark. Use the high-power LED for maximum light output of 130 lumens; the white and red proximity LEDs use less battery power and are ideal for use around camp.

Red LEDs help preserve your night vision. Strobe settings for both the white and red LEDs can be used to signal in the mountains or increase your chance of being seen while walking or biking around town. 3 AAA batteries (included) provide up to 50 hrs. of use with the high-output LED on high and 200 hrs. with it on low. Lock mode helps prevent accidentally turning the headlamp on when it's in your backpack. Streamlined design sets the beam at an efficient illumination angle; ratcheting swivel head aims light where you need it. IPX4 water-resistant construction delivers reliability in inclement weather. Black Diamond Spot headlamp has a compact design that fits securely around your head with an adjustable elastic band that won't pull hair.","short_description":"The Black Diamond Spot is the one headlight that can do it all.
