Footprint is sized a bit smaller than the tent floor to prevent water from pooling underneath the tent during rainy weather. Color-coding on the webbing stake-outs at the corners allows easy attachment. For a minimalist pitch option, leave your tent body at home and set up its rainfly, poles and this footprint as an ultralight shelter. The REI Quarter Dome 2 Footprint fits only the 2014 REI Quarter Dome 2 Tent (sold separately).","short_description":"The REI Quarter Dome 2 Footprint extends the life of your tent by protecting the floor from abrasion and excess wear and tear.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Tents","product_group":"Tent Accessories","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s425103.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l425103.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=425103&tt=df","retail_price":"29.50","sale_price":"29.50","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=425103\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m425103.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=862424&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8624240001":{"sku":"8624240001","vendor_sku":"16394","upc":"486242400011","color":"SHARKSKIN/GRANITE","retail_price":"29.50","sale_price":"29.50"}}}
