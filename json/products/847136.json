{"sku":"847136","manufacturer_id":"00014563","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":"REI Camp X Chair","long_description":"The REI Camp X chair raises the bar for comfort with exclusive X-Web technology that makes your campfire or backyard lounge sessions so much more enjoyable. X-Web technology uses X-shape webbing to tension the seat and back panel, and distribute your weight for excellent sitting comfort. Mono-mesh and polyester seating surface stands up to regular use and exposure to weather; mesh fabric drains water and dries quickly. Frame is constructed of heavy-duty, thick-walled steel tubing for enduring strength; powder coating keeps the frame looking nice for years of use. Versatile integrated cup holder on the right armrest accommodates a wide variety of container shapes and sizes, from mugs to plastic bottles to long-neck glass bottles. Drop-down pocket on the left armrest holds your cell phone and other small valuables; cinch the pocket closed with the string and cordlock to keep items from falling out. Chair has a weight capacity of 300 lbs. The REI Camp X chair packs up into the included stuff sack for easy storage and transportation.","short_description":"The REI Camp X chair raises the bar for comfort with exclusive X-Web technology that makes your campfire or backyard lounge sessions so much more enjoyable.","category":"Camping & Hiking","subcategory":"Camping Chairs","product_group":"Camp Chairs","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s281163.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l281163.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=281163&tt=df","keywords":"trail,seat,beach,folding,lounger","retail_price":"39.50","sale_price":"39.50","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=281163\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m281163.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=847136&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8471360002":{"sku":"8471360002","vendor_sku":"00014563","upc":"484713600021","color":"PINEDALE","retail_price":"39.50","sale_price":"39.50"},"8471360003":{"sku":"8471360003","vendor_sku":"00014563","upc":"484713600038","color":"COAL","retail_price":"39.50","sale_price":"39.50"}}}
