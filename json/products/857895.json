{"sku":"857895","manufacturer_id":"B130301002105","brand_name":"K2","product_name":" K2 Raider Snowboard Boots - 2013/2014","long_description":"Get some serious bang for your buck. The K2 Raider snowboard boots offer great all-mountain performance, secure Boa(R) lacing, Intuition(TM) liners and high style without draining your wallet. Raider boots are for both beginning and advanced riders who are looking for a supportive boot that will hold up for all-mountain, freestyle riding. Boa(R) Coiler lacing system, with ankle and cable guides along entire edge of eyestays, distributes closure force evenly for a dialed-in fit that won't loosen up. The Coiler scoops up loose cable when entering as well as exiting the boot; put your foot in, pull back on the tongue, twist the reel a few times and you're off. Intuition Comfort Fit 3D liners conform to feet after a few days of riding; moldable, internal J-bars enhance heel hold. Quick, single-pull liner lacing requires only one hand to use and stays locked until you release it with the comfortable webbing loop pulls. Articulating flex zones minimize boot bite through smooth, clean construction. Heel pulls provide easy entry into boots. Low-profile, low-bulk cushioned soles absorb impact, enhance board feel and provide tractorlike grip.","short_description":"Get some serious bang for your buck.
