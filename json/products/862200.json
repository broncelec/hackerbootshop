{"sku":"862200","manufacturer_id":"CF2282TL02","brand_name":"Cannondale","product_name":" Cannondale Althea 3 Women's Bike - 2014","long_description":"From urban pavement to gravel paths, the women's Cannondale Althea 3 bike keeps you sitting comfortably upright and absorbs bumps with its shock-absorbent fork. SR Suntour NEX suspension fork provides 50mm of pothole-damping suspension; suspension can be locked out when it's not needed. Hybrid design blends the speed of a road bike with the sturdy, heads-up ride of a mountain bike inspired frame; low standover height makes mounts and dismounts easy. Frame also uses Cannondale Synapse Active Vibration Elimination (S.A.V.E.) technology to damp road vibration for a smoother ride quality. Find that just-right gear easily with the Shimano shifters, which guide the derailleurs quickly and precisely through the 24 gears. Kenda Happy Medium tires have a fast-rolling center with aggressive outside lugs for enhanced cornering traction. Platform pedals accommodate everyday shoes-just hop on and go. Frame eyelets let you outfit the bike with fenders and a rear rack (not included). Specs on the Cannondale Althea 3 women's bike are subject to change.","short_description":"From urban pavement to gravel paths, the women's Cannondale Althea 3 bike keeps you sitting comfortably upright and absorbs bumps with its shock-absorbent fork.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bikes","product_group":"Hybrid Bikes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s378559.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l378559.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=378559&tt=df","retail_price":"539.00","sale_price":"539.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=378559\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m378559.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=862200&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8622000002":{"sku":"8622000002","vendor_sku":"CF2282MD01","upc":"884603523551","size":"M","color":"MAGNESIUM WHITE/CORAL","retail_price":"539.00","sale_price":"539.00"},"8622000003":{"sku":"8622000003","vendor_sku":"CF2282TL01","upc":"884603523568","size":"Tall","color":"MAGNESIUM WHITE/CORAL","retail_price":"539.00","sale_price":"539.00"},"8622000005":{"sku":"8622000005","vendor_sku":"CF2282MD02","upc":"884603523582","size":"M","color":"JET BLACK/HOLLYWOOD SILVE","retail_price":"539.00","sale_price":"539.00"},"8622000006":{"sku":"8622000006","vendor_sku":"CF2282TL02","upc":"884603523599","size":"Tall","color":"JET BLACK/HOLLYWOOD SILVE","retail_price":"539.00","sale_price":"539.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bikes","hybrid-bikes"]}
