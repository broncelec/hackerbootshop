{"sku":"866720","manufacturer_id":"0","brand_name":"Hoka One One","product_name":" Hoka One One Bondi 3 Road-Running Shoes - Women's","long_description":"Great for runners looking for an ultra-lightweight, stable and well cushioned shoe, the Hoka One One Bondi 3 Road-Running Shoes have oversize midsoles that provide unmatched cushion and stability. Oversize EVA midsoles are up to 2.5 times thicker than standard running shoes to absorb shock and reduce fatigue in your feet, legs and core. Meta-Rocker midsole geometry is engineered for a low heel-to-toe drop to support your form and promote efficient running mechanics. 4mm heel-to-toe drop encourages a natural midfoot or forefoot strike to promote forward momentum and reduce the impact of heel striking. Active Foot Frame midsole geometry allows the feet to sink into the shoes as opposed to sitting on top to provide great feedback to the feet while you're running. Uppers are made with lightweight, breathable air mesh; comfort collars won't irritate your ankles. Hoka One One Bondi 3 Road-Running Shoes have carbon rubber/rubber outsoles that provide good traction on wet and dry pavement.","short_description":"Great for runners looking for an ultra-lightweight, stable and well cushioned shoe, the Hoka One One Bondi 3 Road-Running Shoes have oversize midsoles that provide unmatched cushion and stability.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Women's Footwear","product_group":"Women's Shoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s388095.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l388095.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=388095&tt=df","retail_price":"150.00","sale_price":"150.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=388095\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m388095.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=866720&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8667200001":{"sku":"8667200001","vendor_sku":"0","upc":"887278729167","size":"6","color":"CLOVER/BLACK/RED ORANGE","retail_price":"150.00","sale_price":"150.00"},"8667200005":{"sku":"8667200005","vendor_sku":"0","upc":"887278729204","size":"8","color":"CLOVER/BLACK/RED ORANGE","retail_price":"150.00","sale_price":"150.00"},"8667200006":{"sku":"8667200006","vendor_sku":"0","upc":"887278729211","size":"8.5","color":"CLOVER/BLACK/RED ORANGE","retail_price":"150.00","sale_price":"150.00"},"8667200007":{"sku":"8667200007","vendor_sku":"0","upc":"887278729228","size":"9","color":"CLOVER/BLACK/RED ORANGE","retail_price":"150.00","sale_price":"150.00"},"8667200008":{"sku":"8667200008","vendor_sku":"0","upc":"887278729235","size":"9.5","color":"CLOVER/BLACK/RED ORANGE","retail_price":"150.00","sale_price":"150.00"},"8667200009":{"sku":"8667200009","vendor_sku":"0","upc":"887278729242","size":"10","color":"CLOVER/BLACK/RED ORANGE","retail_price":"150.00","sale_price":"150.00"},"8667200011":{"sku":"8667200011","vendor_sku":"0","upc":"887278728917","size":"6.5","color":"CORAL/HI VIZ/CITRUS","retail_price":"150.00","sale_price":"150.00"},"8667200015":{"sku":"8667200015","vendor_sku":"0","upc":"887278728955","size":"8.5","color":"CORAL/HI VIZ/CITRUS","retail_price":"150.00","sale_price":"150.00"},"8667200018":{"sku":"8667200018","vendor_sku":"0","upc":"887278728986","size":"10","color":"CORAL/HI VIZ/CITRUS","retail_price":"150.00","sale_price":"150.00"}}}
