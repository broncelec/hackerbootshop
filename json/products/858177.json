{"sku":"858177","manufacturer_id":"8A312000001","brand_name":"Blizzard","product_name":"Blizzard Dakota Skis - Women's - 2013-2014","long_description":"Built for epic powder days at the resort, the Blizzard Dakota women's skis offer advanced skiers 108mm waists and naturally rockered tips and tails that float in the deep stuff. Blizzard builds the rocker without bending the core, creating a naturally flexing, responsive ski that turns easily, resists high-speed chatter and shreds crud and pow. Light camber underfoot assists with grip on hardpack. Layered wood core designed specifically for advanced female skiers creates a lightweight, snappy ski with smooth handling. Fiberglass reinforcement laid in 4 separate directions increases snappiness and power underfoot. True twin profile provides equal responsiveness whether you're skiing forward or backward. Sidewalls direct power right to the edges of the skis, resulting in quick side-to-side response. 114mm waists require bindings with wide brakes.","short_description":"Built for epic powder days at the resort, the Blizzard Dakota women's skis offer advanced skiers 108mm waists and naturally rockered tips and tails that float in the deep stuff.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s381971.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l381971.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=381971&tt=df","retail_price":"749.95","sale_price":"524.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=381971\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m381971.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=858177&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8581770001":{"sku":"8581770001","vendor_sku":"8A312000001","upc":"885315549334","size":"170 CM","color":"BLUE/SILVER","retail_price":"524.83","sale_price":"524.83"},"8581770002":{"sku":"8581770002","vendor_sku":"8A312000001","upc":"885315549341","size":"177 CM","color":"BLUE/SILVER","retail_price":"524.83","sale_price":"524.83"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
