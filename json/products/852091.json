{"sku":"852091","manufacturer_id":"53704","brand_name":"Seattle Sports","product_name":" Seattle Sports TurboMite Boat Cart","long_description":"Small but mighty, the Seattle Sports TurboMite boat cart transports your boat to the water without the backache. The perfect companion for short portages from the car to the water, it's also small enough to fit through most kayak hatches. 150 lb. capacity is more than enough for an average kayak or canoe, and an included kickstand supports cart during loading to reduce loading time and hassle. Inflatable rubber wheels have the traction to roll your boat down moderate terrain. Sturdy, corrosion-resistant aluminum frame with 25mm gauge tubing stands up to heavy use. Nylon tie-down strap with cam buckle secures the boat to the forward bar of the cart, increasing transport security. Please note that this cart is intended for pavement, maintained paths and beach sand; it is not intended for use over rutted and rocky terrain.","short_description":"Small but mighty, the Seattle Sports TurboMite boat cart transports your boat to the water without the backache.","category":"Paddling","subcategory":"Kayak Accessories","product_group":"Kayak Carts","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s430411.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l430411.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=430411&tt=df","retail_price":"89.95","sale_price":"66.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=430411\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m430411.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=852091&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8520910001":{"sku":"8520910001","vendor_sku":"53704","upc":"780292537049","color":"GREEN","retail_price":"66.93","sale_price":"66.93"}}}
