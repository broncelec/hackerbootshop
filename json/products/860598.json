{"sku":"860598","manufacturer_id":"L35527300","brand_name":"Salomon","product_name":"Salomon Equipe 8 Skate Skis","long_description":"The Salomon Equipe 8 skate skis are a great purchase for intermediate and expert skiers alike. They offer fast-gliding fun, well-balanced stability and control, and a consistent, responsive ride. Densolite 3000 preshaped foam cores are wrapped in bidirectional fiberglass and carbon for high torsional stiffness without excess weight. Javelin sidecut features a thin tip and slight inward curve in the middle that gives you a stable ride on the base of the ski for maximum speed before you roll on edge to kick. Power camber balances weight distribution between the front and rear gliding zones, keeping the center of the ski above the snow for improved glide, acceleration and stability. G4 performance bases contain graphite to help retain wax for fast gliding in most types of snow. Salomon Equipe 8 skate ski bases feature a low-pressure stone grinding with light structure for fast glide.","short_description":"The Salomon Equipe 8 skate skis are a great purchase for intermediate and expert skiers alike.
