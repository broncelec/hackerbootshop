{"sku":"824504","manufacturer_id":"LB15120","brand_name":"Lange","product_name":" Lange RSJ 65 Jr Ski Boots - Juniors' - 2012/2013","long_description":"The Lange RSJ 65 Jr ski boots let young skiers bring precise speed to their next descent. Because the Lange RSJ 65 Jr ski boots are made of a single, uniform material (versus bi-injected shells), power transfer is highly efficient. Single-material shells are also much easier for boot fitters to grind and punch. Shells are designed to create a centered, balanced stance using a low heel lift and an upright forward lean. Upright stance makes it easy to stay balanced on today's shaped and rockered skis, reducing fatigue and increasing efficiency of skiing technique. Based on adult liners used in racing boots, the RSJ 65 Jr liners feature shaped padding and a neoprene toe box that provide warmth and comfort. Low cuffs are designed to maximize the natural range of motion for young skiers. Arched soles enhance flex and provide a distinct feel that helps young skiers dig into their turns. With a 60 flex index, Lange RSJ 65 Jr ski boots provide flex appropriate for young skiers.","short_description":"The Lange RSJ 65 Jr ski boots let young skiers bring precise speed to their next descent.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Downhill Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382431.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382431.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382431&tt=df","keywords":"jstp7615","retail_price":"199.95","sale_price":"119.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382431\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382431.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=824504&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8245040002":{"sku":"8245040002","vendor_sku":"LB15120","size":"Mondo 23.5","color":"SPEED BLUE","retail_price":"119.93","sale_price":"119.93"},"8245040003":{"sku":"8245040003","vendor_sku":"LB15120","size":"Mondo 24.5","color":"SPEED BLUE","retail_price":"119.93","sale_price":"119.93"},"8245040004":{"sku":"8245040004","vendor_sku":"LB15120","size":"Mondo 25.5","color":"SPEED BLUE","retail_price":"119.93","sale_price":"119.93"},"8245040005":{"sku":"8245040005","vendor_sku":"LB15120","size":"Mondo 26.5","color":"SPEED BLUE","retail_price":"119.93","sale_price":"119.93"}},"categories":["snow","ski-boots","downhill-ski-boots"]}
