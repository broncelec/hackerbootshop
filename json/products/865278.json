Contoured, padded shoulder straps and waistbelt wrap around to offer comfortable support under pack load; buckle on sternum strap doubles as a safety whistle. Wide panel opening to main compartment gives you easy access to contents; internal sleeve accommodates a hydration reservoir (not included).
