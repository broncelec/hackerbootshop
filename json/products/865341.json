It's an essential tool to have when backpacking or traveling. Single Maxbright LED throws a bright white beam up to 73m on high; three 5mm LEDs reach up to 53m on high. Remix is available with red, white or green 5mm LEDs; select which version you want when purchasing; all versions include a white Maxbright LED. Red LEDs minimize the impact on your night vision; green LEDs are helpful when looking at topographic maps. Both the Maxbright LED and the three 5mm LEDs can be operated on high or low to suit your lighting needs. One CR123 battery (included) provides 4 hrs. of burn time for the Maxbright LED on high; using the 5mm LEDs on low, the batteries provide 40 hrs. of operation. Single-arm ratcheting head pivots up and down, providing a wide range of motion so you can aim the beam wherever you need it. Large push-button on/off switch on the Princeton Tec Remix Headlamp can be operated with gloves on. Please note: the specs indicate that this headlamp has a red light mode; however, red LEDs are only available if you select the red LED version when purchasing the headlamp.","short_description":"Built to endure the rigors of any adventure, the bright and compact Princeton Tec Remix Headlamp outputs 125 lumens to light up the night.
