Ultralight fabrics create 200 sq. ft. of coverage at a weight and size you can carry anywhere. Tight-pitching wing design and small packed size make this shelter at home in the backcountry, too. Ultralight and taped DuraShield(TM)-coated silnylon offers waterproof protection for the long haul. 2 double-tapered aluminum poles with reinforced mid-sections offer excellent strength while keeping weight to a minimum.
