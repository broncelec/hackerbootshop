{"sku":"868565","manufacturer_id":"VN-0UE2Y31","brand_name":"Vans","product_name":" Vans Ferra Snowboard Boots - Women's - 2013/2014","long_description":"If you're a hard-charging rider looking for all-mountain performers, choose the women's Vans Ferra Snowboard Boots. Hybrid Boa(R) lacing system lets you dial in the fit for all-day comfort. Vans Hybrid Boa lacing offers the best of both worlds: it combines traditional laces with a Boa closure that focuses primarily on the critical instep area of the boots. This configuration allows you to lace your boots tighter than with traditional laces only, and it also allows on-the-fly instep adjustments. Cuffs flex easily for enhanced board control when carving; wrap-around design offers a secure closure around your ankles and calves. Dual instep flex zones allow a forgiving flex and natural articulation while maintaining side-to-side support. Molded EVA footbeds feature integrated arch support and dual-density metatarsal and heel impact-relief pads. RECCO(R) reflector technology enhances radio signals from search-and-rescue RECCO detectors for quicker location in an avalanche. Vans Ferra Snowboard Boots feature cushioned rubber outsoles with an inverted waffle tread pattern for increased traction.","short_description":"If you're a hard-charging rider looking for all-mountain performers, choose the women's Vans Ferra Snowboard Boots.
