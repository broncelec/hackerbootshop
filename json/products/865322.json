{"sku":"865322","manufacturer_id":"1201491B672.110","brand_name":"Brooks","product_name":"Brooks Ravenna 5 Road-Running Shoes - Women's","long_description":"Riding the line between neutral and support, the Brooks Ravenna 5 Road-Running Shoes give you that just-right blend of cushion and stability for your long training runs. Synthetic mesh uppers enhance breathability and quick-drying performance; synthetic overlays offer support and a good fit without adding cumbersome weight. Midsoles feature BioMoGo polymer alloy foam, which provides cushioning, energy return and reduced foot fatigue; nontoxic additive helps midsoles break down in landfills. Nylon and spandex linings absorb and disperse moisture for enhanced comfort. Progressive Diagonal Roll Bar triple-density medial posts work to control excessive pronation and balance transitions from midfoot to toe-off. Thermoplastic urethane arch shanks control torsional flex at midfoot for control and support. Forefoot Stable-Pod configuration balances midsole and outsole components to set feet in an efficient, balanced position to maximize stability and responsiveness. Outsoles on the Brooks Ravenna 5 Road-Running Shoes are constructed of a mix of rubber compounds to maximize longevity and grip. Outsoles also feature a special crash pad design that smooths out the landing zone to deliver full ground contact while your run.","short_description":"Riding the line between neutral and support, the Brooks Ravenna 5 Road-Running Shoes give you that just-right blend of cushion and stability for your long training runs.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Women's Footwear","product_group":"Women's Shoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s387911.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l387911.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=387911&tt=df","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=387911\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m387911.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=865322&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8653220002":{"sku":"8653220002","vendor_sku":"1201491B834.065","upc":"883439841150","size":"6.5","color":"BLUEFISH/FIERY CORAL/GREE","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"8653220004":{"sku":"8653220004","vendor_sku":"1201491B834.075","upc":"883439841174","size":"7.5","color":"BLUEFISH/FIERY CORAL/GREE","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"8653220005":{"sku":"8653220005","vendor_sku":"1201491B834.080","upc":"883439841181","size":"8","color":"BLUEFISH/FIERY CORAL/GREE","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"8653220006":{"sku":"8653220006","vendor_sku":"1201491B834.085","upc":"883439841198","size":"8.5","color":"BLUEFISH/FIERY CORAL/GREE","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"8653220007":{"sku":"8653220007","vendor_sku":"1201491B834.090","upc":"883439841204","size":"9","color":"BLUEFISH/FIERY CORAL/GREE","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"8653220008":{"sku":"8653220008","vendor_sku":"1201491B834.095","upc":"883439841211","size":"9.5","color":"BLUEFISH/FIERY CORAL/GREE","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"8653220010":{"sku":"8653220010","vendor_sku":"1201491B834.105","upc":"883439841235","size":"10.5","color":"BLUEFISH/FIERY CORAL/GREE","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"8653220011":{"sku":"8653220011","vendor_sku":"1201491B834.110","upc":"883439841242","size":"11","color":"BLUEFISH/FIERY CORAL/GREE","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"}},"categories":["footwear","womens-footwear","womens-shoes"]}
