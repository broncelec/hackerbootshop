Choose from smoke/white or brown versions. Includes 1 set of polarized lenses and 1 set of SportFlex(TM) lenses, for a total of 2 sets of lenses. Interchangeable lens system lets you switch out lenses to accommodate a variety of light conditions and activities. Smoke/white frames feature polarized gray lenses and are ideal for extremely bright sunlight; gray tint helps maintain color saturation and natural contrasts. Brown frames feature polarized brown lenses and are ideal for partial and full sun days. Additional SportFlex orange-yellow lenses come with either frame choice and have a mirror coating suitable for a range of low lighting(TM)cloudy, overcast, dusk and dawn. N3(TM) polarized lenses block 40% of infrared light (decreasing eye fatigue), offer blue light filtering and 100% UV protection to minimize haze and enhance clarity. Lenses and lightweight, yet durable frames are built to withstand a high-velocity impact. Frames endure extreme highs and lows in temperature. Self-adjusting nosepads and ear stems create a nonslip grip that keeps sunglasses in place, ensuring a soft feel and personalized fit. Temple ends hug behind your ears to keep sunglasses in place. Cam-action spring hinges quickly lock temples into position. Native Eyewear Eastrim interchangeable polarized sunglasses include a protective case and a soft pouch that doubles as a cleaning cloth. Frames best fit medium to large profiles.","short_description":"The Native Eyewear Eastrim polarized sunglasses are a great choice for year-round use, whether mountain biking, running, hiking or hanging at the beach.
