{"sku":"856938","manufacturer_id":"3211220","brand_name":"Gnu","product_name":" GNU Metal Guru EC2 BTX Snowboard - 2013/2014","long_description":"With elliptical camber at the ends for catch-free jibbing, the GNU Metal Guru EC2 BTX Snowboard is made for the park but knows how to lay trenches on the groomers. EC2 BTX elliptical camber features Banana Tech rocker between the bindings and elliptical camber under your feet for effortless float in powder and unmatchable pop in the park. Camber provides end-to-end stability and plenty of pop for boosting off natural terrain; Banana Traction technology offers carving performance and soft-snow float. Magne-Traction improves edge grip by adding seven contact points along the running length of the board, resulting in amazing control whether riding ice or pow. True Twin shape allows you to ride equally well in both direction. Mervin CGA.5 Aspen Columbian Gold core with sintered sidewalls offers strength, control and pop; fiberglass gives the core strength and pop. Impact-resistant end-grain internal sidewalls; UHMW sidewalls stand up to wear and tear; steel edges; sintered base is fast and low maintenance.
