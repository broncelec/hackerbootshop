{"sku":"854918","manufacturer_id":"15634","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":"REI Midweight Polartec Power Dry Half Zip Top - Men's","long_description":"A warm, wicking base layer like the REI Midweight Polartec(R) Power Dry(R) Half Zip top can make the difference between cold-weather trips to remember and those to forget. Polartec Power Dry utilizes 2 different yarns on either side of the fabric to enhance comfort: interior yarn wicks moisture, and exterior yarn dries quickly. Combination of the 2 yarns helps keep you dry during highly aerobic activities because it moves moisture away from skin faster than single-component fabrics such as cotton. Fabric offers UPF rating of 20 to protect against harmful UV light. Center front zipper allows ventilation control. Flatseam construction is soft and non-chafing next to skin, and raglan seams are designed to be comfortable when wearing pack straps on your shoulders. Underarm and side gussets promote freedom of motion and reduce chafing under a hipbelt. Longer length helps top stay tucked in, and smooth texture of outer surface helps it slide easily under extra layers. The men's REI Midweight Polartec Power Dry Half Zip top features a next-to-skin fit that hugs the body.","short_description":"A warm, wicking base layer like the REI Midweight Polartec(R) Power Dry(R) Half Zip top can make the difference between cold-weather trips to remember and those to forget.","category":"Men's Clothing","subcategory":"Men's Underwear","product_group":"Men's Long Underwear Tops","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s384823.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l384823.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=384823&tt=df","retail_price":"46.50","sale_price":"46.50","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=384823\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m384823.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=854918&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8549180009":{"sku":"8549180009","vendor_sku":"15634","upc":"485491800092","size":"S","color":"ZINC","retail_price":"46.50","sale_price":"46.50"},"8549180010":{"sku":"8549180010","vendor_sku":"15634","upc":"485491800108","size":"M","color":"ZINC","retail_price":"46.50","sale_price":"46.50"},"8549180011":{"sku":"8549180011","vendor_sku":"15634","upc":"485491800115","size":"L","color":"ZINC","retail_price":"46.50","sale_price":"46.50"},"8549180012":{"sku":"8549180012","vendor_sku":"15634","upc":"485491800122","size":"XL","color":"ZINC","retail_price":"46.50","sale_price":"46.50"},"8549180013":{"sku":"8549180013","vendor_sku":"15634","upc":"485491800139","size":"S","color":"PUGET SOUND","retail_price":"46.50","sale_price":"46.50"},"8549180014":{"sku":"8549180014","vendor_sku":"15634","upc":"485491800146","size":"M","color":"PUGET SOUND","retail_price":"46.50","sale_price":"46.50"},"8549180015":{"sku":"8549180015","vendor_sku":"15634","upc":"485491800153","size":"L","color":"PUGET SOUND","retail_price":"46.50","sale_price":"46.50"},"8549180016":{"sku":"8549180016","vendor_sku":"15634","upc":"485491800160","size":"XL","color":"PUGET SOUND","retail_price":"46.50","sale_price":"46.50"},"8549180017":{"sku":"8549180017","vendor_sku":"15634","upc":"485491800177","size":"XXL","color":"PUGET SOUND","retail_price":"46.50","sale_price":"46.50"}},"categories":["mens","mens-underwear","mens-long-underwear-tops"]}
