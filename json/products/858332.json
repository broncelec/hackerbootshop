{"sku":"858332","manufacturer_id":"320193-GRY","brand_name":"Dc","product_name":" DC Judge Boa Snowboard Boots - 2013/2014","long_description":"The verdict is in. DC Judge Boa(R) snowboard boots are built to shred the whole mountain. Boa lacing delivers a dialed-in fit, and Aerotech ventilation system keeps the air flowing for comfort. Boa(R) Focus lacing features 2 fit zones that tighten independently; it concentrates closure on the instep and holds the heel securely no matter how the upper is cranked. Boa H3 Coiler scoops up loose cable when entering and exiting the boot; put your foot in, pull back on the tongue, twist the reel a few times and you're off. Aerotech ventilation system integrates vents into the shells and liners to transfer heat and moisture away from your feet, keeping them comfortable all day long. Custom-moldable EVA liners feature anatomic J-bars for amazing support; power straps around the cuffs and elastic straps over the insteps enhance support. Cushioned, dual-density EVA footbeds feature impact heel cushions; internal ankle harnesses hold liners in place, locking your heels down for amazing control. Articulated tongues and molded backstays offer support, and help you control your edges during toe-side and heel-side turns. Unilite outsoles provide durability, damping and cushioning; snow-shedding traction tread ensures sure footing.","short_description":"The verdict is in.
