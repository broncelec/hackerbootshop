{"sku":"823007","manufacturer_id":"252551","brand_name":"Burton","product_name":"Burton Emerald Snowboard Boots - Women's - 2011/2012","long_description":"The Burton Emerald snowboard boots go anywhere and rule everything. They offer mid-range support, slipperlike comfort and the simplicity and ease of a lightning fast lacing system. Whether you're messing around in the park or getting the guts to drop off that cliff, going bigger gets even better thanks to superior cushioning in Emerald boots. True Fit(TM) design considers every element, from liners to lace guides, and delivers the best fitting, most comfortable snowboard boots ever. Imprint(TM) 2 EVA liners wrap your feet in comfort; they'll conform to your feet after a few days of riding or you can custom mold them at your local shop. Hot Pockets are small neoprene sleeves sized for disposable foot warmers (includes 2 pairs); they sit on top of your feet and warm up frigid toes. Liners feature long-lasting polyurethane energy panels and Quick Fit(TM) integrated lacing harness for easier-than-ever entry and exit. Strategically placed backstays ensure a consistent flex throughout boot life; even after being flexed repeatedly, they return and maintain their original position. Medium-flex, thin-profile 3D-molded tongues wrap the forefeet for seamless flex, and reduce performance-robbing shell/liner stack-up. Streamlined Speed Zone(TM) shell lacing system lets you fine-tune the fit quickly and easily; customize the upper and lower zones in a matter of seconds. 3-part outsoles give you low-profile stability with an airbag design and EVA midsoles to protect your feet from repeated drops and landings. Get a comfortable fit right out of the box: new, industry-exclusive toe box construction offers a quick break-in period and increases warmth and comfort.","short_description":"The Burton Emerald snowboard boots go anywhere and rule everything.
