{"sku":"718303","manufacturer_id":"262160","brand_name":"Black Diamond","product_name":" Black Diamond Camalot C4 Cams","long_description":"Black Diamond Camalot(TM) C4 cams utilize a double-axle design to retract the cam lobes, giving them a larger expansion range than traditional single-axle cams. Large expansion ranges create generous overlaps between sizes, allowing you to carry fewer pieces and still cover your bases. C-loop continuous cable stem is strong and durable; rigid stem makes for easy placement, yet remains flexible even in cold weather. Ergonomic trigger permits individual manipulation of cams and can be pulled easily with gloved hands. Wide cam lobes distribute the load on soft rock; overall width of unit is narrow for better placement in shallow cracks. Cam lobes and sewn-on nylon sling are color-coded for easy identification.","short_description":"Black Diamond Camalot(TM) C4 cams utilize a double-axle design to retract the cam lobes, giving them a larger expansion range than traditional single-axle cams.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Protection","product_group":"Cams","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s407095.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l407095.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=407095&tt=df","retail_price":"119.95","sale_price":"119.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=407095\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m407095.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=718303&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7183030019":{"sku":"7183030019","vendor_sku":"262104","upc":"793661064343","size":"Anthracite","color":"Size .4","retail_price":"59.95","sale_price":"59.95"},"7183030027":{"sku":"7183030027","vendor_sku":"262105","upc":"793661064350","size":"Purple","color":"Size .5","retail_price":"59.95","sale_price":"59.95"},"7183030035":{"sku":"7183030035","vendor_sku":"262107","upc":"793661064367","size":"Sage","color":"Size .75","retail_price":"59.95","sale_price":"59.95"},"7183030043":{"sku":"7183030043","vendor_sku":"262110","upc":"793661064374","size":"Cinnamon","color":"Size 1","retail_price":"64.95","sale_price":"64.95"},"7183030050":{"sku":"7183030050","vendor_sku":"262120","upc":"793661064381","size":"Gold","color":"Size 2","retail_price":"69.95","sale_price":"69.95"},"7183030068":{"sku":"7183030068","vendor_sku":"262130","upc":"793661064398","size":"Blue","color":"Size 3","retail_price":"69.95","sale_price":"69.95"},"7183030076":{"sku":"7183030076","vendor_sku":"262140","upc":"793661064404","size":"Anthracite","color":"Size 4","retail_price":"84.95","sale_price":"84.95"},"7183030084":{"sku":"7183030084","vendor_sku":"262150","upc":"793661064411","size":"Purple","color":"Size 5","retail_price":"109.95","sale_price":"109.95"},"7183030092":{"sku":"7183030092","vendor_sku":"262160","upc":"793661064428","size":"Sage","color":"Size 6","retail_price":"119.95","sale_price":"119.95"},"7183030100":{"sku":"7183030100","vendor_sku":"262103","upc":"793661081449","size":"Blue","color":"Size .3","retail_price":"59.95","sale_price":"59.95"}},"categories":["climbing","climbing-protection","cams"]}
