{"sku":"826068","manufacturer_id":"BUS05235","brand_name":"Novara","product_name":" Novara Express Bike - 2014","long_description":"Blending comfort and speed, our Novara Express(R) bike offers all the agility and efficiency of a road bike with an upright, comfortable riding position. 6061 aluminum frame is strong and stiff, supplying quick acceleration and efficient power transfer; shaped seatstays and top tube enhance comfort and performance. Fork boasts a tapered alloy steerer with a 1-piece alloy crown for strength and stiffness where it counts; carbon legs help damp road vibrations and reduce weight. Flat handlebar positions the rider upright, thereby reducing the stress to hands, neck and back while also improving heads-up visibility. Bar ends help you stand over the pedals to power up steep ascents; platform pedals with toe cages let you wear everyday shoes while helping keep feet positioned on pedals. Shimano triple crankset and 9-speed cassette provide 27 gears to handle any grade. Shimano trigger shifters and derailleurs offer smooth, precise and dependable shifts. Linear-pull brakes ensure easy speed management. Shimano hubs are laced onto Weinmann rims and outfitted with puncture-resistant, smooth-rolling and reflective Vittoria Randonneur tires for all-around riding. Frame features eyelets for fenders or a rear rack (sold separately) for easy utilitarian upgrading. Replaceable rear derailleur hanger help extends the usable life of the frame. Specs on our Novara Express bike are subject to change.","short_description":"Blending comfort and speed, our Novara Express(R) bike offers all the agility and efficiency of a road bike with an upright, comfortable riding position.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bikes","product_group":"Road Bikes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s374511.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l374511.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=374511&tt=df","retail_price":"849.00","sale_price":"720.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=374511\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m374511.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=826068&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8260680001":{"sku":"8260680001","vendor_sku":"BUS05235","upc":"482606800015","size":"S","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"720.93","sale_price":"720.93"},"8260680002":{"sku":"8260680002","vendor_sku":"BUS05235","upc":"482606800022","size":"M","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"720.93","sale_price":"720.93"},"8260680003":{"sku":"8260680003","vendor_sku":"BUS05235","upc":"482606800039","size":"L","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"720.93","sale_price":"720.93"},"8260680004":{"sku":"8260680004","vendor_sku":"BUS05235","upc":"482606800046","size":"XL","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"720.93","sale_price":"720.93"}},"categories":["cycling","bikes","road-bikes"]}
