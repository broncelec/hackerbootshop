{"sku":"859342","manufacturer_id":"S130312001167","brand_name":"K2","product_name":" K2 SuperBright 102 Skis - Women's - 2013/2014","long_description":"With nimble, lightweight construction for tight trees and icy chutes, plus rockered tips to float in powder, the women's K2 SuperBright 102 skis are designed to explore backside terrain. Rockered tips initiate turns easily and offer agile performance in deep snow, and slight camber underfoot offers tenacious edge hold on firm snow. K2 women's skis reduce the bulk and weight of all components to create very lightweight skis suited to the specific needs of female skiers. Stiff enough for high speeds and fast turns, the Bioflex2 core combines aspen, paulownia and bamboo to deliver light weight and responsive performance. A fiberglass weave around the wood core provides torsional stiffness for highly responsive turning, and a web of carbon fiber located in the tips and tails increases edge hold. Cap construction contributes to light skis that are easy to maneuver. Use tip and tail holes to attach skins (sold separately); remove plugs with a flathead screwdriver. 102mm waists require bindings with wide brakes. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.","short_description":"With nimble, lightweight construction for tight trees and icy chutes, plus rockered tips to float in powder, the women's K2 SuperBright 102 skis are designed to explore backside terrain.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382083.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382083.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382083&tt=df","retail_price":"649.95","sale_price":"389.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382083\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382083.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859342&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{},"extended_xml_attributes":"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"}
