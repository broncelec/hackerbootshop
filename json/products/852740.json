Waterproof, highly breathable GORE-TEX inserts keep your hands dependably dry and comfortable. PrimaLoft(R) One is a patented ultrafine microfiber blend that offers downlike softness, and is incredibly lightweight and water repellent. 100g insulation on the palms and 150g on the backs of the hands keeps your fingers warm when you're skiing down cold, snowy slopes. Palms are lined with polyester with a FlashDry(TM) fabric additive that dramatically improves drying time and breathability without adding weight or bulk or washing out. 5 Dimensional Fit(TM) uses 5 measurements of the hand to construct gloves with an accurate and consistent fit. Radiametric Articulation(TM) improves warmth and blood flow to your fingers by mirroring the natural relaxed curve of the hand. The North Face Mountain Saiku gloves have water-resistant cowhide leather exteriors that stand up to regular use and provide great grip. Low-profile cuffs fit underneath your jacket; stretchy cuffs seal out cold air.","short_description":"With dependable GORE-TEX(R) waterproofness and warm PrimaLoft(R) insulation, The North Face Mountain Saiku gloves are built to keep your hands dry and warm on backcountry winter adventures.","category":"Men's","subcategory":"Men's Gloves And Mittens","product_group":"Men's Insulated Gloves","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s340331.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l340331.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=340331&tt=df","keywords":"winter gloves,warm,snow gloves,men's insulated gloves","retail_price":"160.00","sale_price":"160.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=340331\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m340331.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=852740&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8527400002":{"sku":"8527400002","vendor_sku":"A7KM-JK3","upc":"766182233000","size":"M","color":"TNF BLACK","retail_price":"160.00","sale_price":"160.00"},"8527400003":{"sku":"8527400003","vendor_sku":"A7KM-JK3","upc":"766182232997","size":"L","color":"TNF BLACK","retail_price":"160.00","sale_price":"160.00"},"8527400006":{"sku":"8527400006","vendor_sku":"A7KM-174","upc":"766182232928","size":"M","color":"UTILITY BROWN","retail_price":"160.00","sale_price":"160.00"},"8527400007":{"sku":"8527400007","vendor_sku":"A7KM-175","upc":"766182232911","size":"L","color":"UTILITY BROWN","retail_price":"160.00","sale_price":"160.00"}}}
