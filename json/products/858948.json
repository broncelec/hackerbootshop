{"sku":"858948","manufacturer_id":"S18011-42","brand_name":"Fischer","product_name":"Fischer OffTrack 3 BC Cross-Country Ski Boots","long_description":"Cold feet are a thing of the past thanks to the wool-blend linings in the Fischer Off Track 3 BC cross-country ski boots. Stable backcountry soles provide stability for off-track explorations. Synthetic linings with wool fibers insulate efficiently even when wet and breathe to regulate temperature for outstanding comfort in wide-ranging conditions. NNN BC outsoles have a medium flex optimized for off-track terrain; they transfer power efficiently while being comfortable and durable when you need to walk on them. Waterproof, lightweight integrated gaiters keep you dry when you're in deep, untracked snow; drawcord adjustment fits over all types of pants. Lace covers with sealed zippers keep snow and ice off the laces and help keep feet dry. Internal molded heel cups on the Fischer Off Track 3 BC boots stabilize the heels and counter pronation and supination. Large entry loops back and front, plus wide openings, reduce the energy required to get in and out of boots, especially nice when wearing warm/bulky winter clothing.","short_description":"Cold feet are a thing of the past thanks to the wool-blend linings in the Fischer Off Track 3 BC cross-country ski boots.
