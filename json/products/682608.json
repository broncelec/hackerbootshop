{"sku":"682608","brand_name":"Custom Correct","product_name":" Custom Correct Custom Correct Gray Wolf - Dosewallips Map","long_description":"Large-scale, topographic map of the Gray Wolf/Dosewallips area of Olympic National Park and Buckhorn Wilderness. Has the same professional look and feel as a U. S. Geological Survey 15' topo map, including the standard 1:62,500 scale (1 inch to the mile). However, instead of the USGS \"quad\" format, each map is laid out to include an entire area of interest, and entire trail systems on a single map. Trails were carefully field checked, re-mapped and depicted with easily visible red lines or dashes (depending on the maintenance class of the trail). Accurate distances in miles and km, true woodland shading and up-to-date roads, road numbers, names and boundaries. Scale of 1: 62,500; contour intervals of 50 feet.
