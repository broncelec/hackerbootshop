{"sku":"862531","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":"REI Expedition Sleeping Bag","long_description":"Designed for mountaineering, the REI Expedition Sleeping Bag features water-repellent down insulation, a waterproof/breathable shell and a double zipper system for temperature regulation. With a temperature rating of -20degF, this bag is suitable for 4-season use. Unique double zipper system allows you to adjust comfort as needed-fully close both zippers to increase warmth, open inner zipper to decrease warmth. Water-repellent 700-fill-power duck down offers superior loft and warmth. REI double-protection design combines a polymer-coated down fill with waterproof/breathable ripstop nylon all around; shell also has a durable water repellent finish. REI in-the-round design puts vertical baffles in side walls to wrap you in warmth and create a better fit than bags that use only horizontal baffles. Contoured hood, draft collar and full-length draft tubes all work to keep warmth in. Differentiated hood and neck drawcords simplify adjustments; antisnag zippers work smoothly. Pass-through pocket has zippers on the outside and the inside to provide easy access to your stashed essentials. The REI Expedition Sleeping Bag includes a nylon stuff sack and a large cotton storage bag.","short_description":"Designed for mountaineering, the REI Expedition Sleeping Bag features water-repellent down insulation, a waterproof/breathable shell and a double zipper system for temperature regulation.","category":"Camping & Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags","product_group":"Adult Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s358699.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l358699.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=358699&tt=df","keywords":"sleeping,sleep,winter,insulated,bag","retail_price":"529.00","sale_price":"529.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=358699\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m358699.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=862531&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8625310001":{"sku":"8625310001","vendor_sku":"16292","upc":"486253100016","size":"Regular","color":"COAL","retail_price":"499.00","sale_price":"499.00"},"8625310002":{"sku":"8625310002","vendor_sku":"16292","upc":"486253100023","size":"Long","color":"COAL","retail_price":"529.00","sale_price":"529.00"},"8625310003":{"sku":"8625310003","vendor_sku":"16292","upc":"486253100030","size":"Short","color":"COAL","retail_price":"479.00","sale_price":"479.00"}}}
