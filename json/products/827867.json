{"sku":"827867","manufacturer_id":"13789","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":"REI Lightweight Polartec Power Dry Crew - Men's","long_description":"The REI Lightweight Polartec(R) Power Dry(R) crew can be worn alone or used as a performance insulation layer. Polartec Power Dry utilizes 2 different yarns on either side of the fabric to enhance comfort: interior yarn wicks moisture, and exterior yarn dries quickly. Updated fabric protects skin against harmful ultraviolet light with a UPF rating of 20 and is very soft to the touch. Flatseam construction is soft and non-chafing next to skin, and seams are designed to work with pack straps at shoulders. The combination of the 2 yarns helps keep you dry during highly aerobic activities because it moves moisture away from skin faster than single-component fabrics such as cotton. Underarm and side gussets promote freedom of motion. Dropped back hem stays tucked in; sleeves are long enough to cover biceps. The REI Lightweight Polartec Power Dry crew features a next-to-skin fit that hugs the body and boosts fabric performance.","short_description":"The REI Lightweight Polartec(R) Power Dry(R) crew can be worn alone or used as a performance insulation layer.","category":"Men's","subcategory":"Men's Underwear","product_group":"Men's Tees And Tanks","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s228979.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l228979.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=228979&tt=df","keywords":"undershirt,shirt,top","retail_price":"29.50","sale_price":"14.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=228979\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m228979.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=827867&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{},"extended_xml_attributes":"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"}
