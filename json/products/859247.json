{"sku":"859247","manufacturer_id":"L35469300","brand_name":"Salomon","product_name":"Salomon X Pro 100 Ski Boots - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Medium-flexing, intermediate-level boots that personalize the fit with a custom-moldable shell, Salomon X Pro 100 ski boots offer high precision for steep terrain and fast turns. Custom-moldable shells adapt to your feet for a superior fit that eliminates pressure points and improves performance; requires specialized equipment best done by boot fitters. Two-part \"Twinframe\" construction is composed of a rigid lower shell for power transmission and precision and a more supple upper shell for comfort. Rigid lower shell provides power transmission where it's needed in the heels, along the sides of the feet and in the binding contact areas. More supple upper shell offers appropriate rigidity above the instep, in the progressively flexing cuffs and in the supportive and flexing backbone of the shell. Oversize 25mm pivot between bottom shell and upper cuff results in greater transmission and power distributed throughout the sole of the boot compared to typical 8mm pivots. Pre-shaped liners grip ankles and heels without too much pressure, and custom-moldable foam conforms under feet, over insteps and along shins for superior foothold. The Salomon X Pro 100 ski boots have a medium flex index of 100, providing the responsive power transfer appropriate for intermediate skiers.","short_description":"Medium-flexing, intermediate-level boots that personalize the fit with a custom-moldable shell, Salomon X Pro 100 ski boots offer high precision for steep terrain and fast turns.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Downhill Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s454811.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l454811.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=454811&tt=df","retail_price":"499.00","sale_price":"499.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=454811\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m454811.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859247&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8592470004":{"sku":"8592470004","vendor_sku":"L35469300","upc":"080694855957","size":"Mondo 29.5","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"499.00","sale_price":"499.00"}},"categories":["snow","ski-boots","downhill-ski-boots"]}
