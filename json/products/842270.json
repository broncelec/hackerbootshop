{"sku":"842270","manufacturer_id":"120113","brand_name":"Black Diamond","product_name":"Black Diamond Quadrant Randonee Boots - Men's - 2012/2013","long_description":"The Black Diamond Quadrant randonee boots bring the downhill performance of a freeride boot together with the light weight of a touring boot so you can take your big skis into the backcountry. Quadrant boots have been redesigned for a better fit and now feature liners with articulation zones and plastic tongues for a smooth, even flex. Triple-injected, multidensity shells use Pebax plastic for a progressive flex; 120 flex index is hearty enough to drive big skis down steep lines. Lightweight liners are comfortable out of the box, but can be custom molded for a more accurate fit; include smooth antimicrobial lining material for easy on and off. Boa Lacing System provides liners a precise and personalized fit that is simple to adjust with the turn of a dial; Boa holds laces tight and secure. Built on 103mm lasts, the liners have roomy toe boxes for touring comfort and good warmth. Tech components in front and back allow the boots to work with Dynafit-style randonee bindings; Quadrant boots are also compatible with step-in style randonee bindings. 4 micro-adjustable buckles and an improved power strap on each boot close the boots comfortably and securely around the feet and legs. Ski/walk switches are hassle free with a simple on/off toggle; ski mode locks you into a forward lean position that can be set from 14deg to 22deg. Walk mode provides a 40deg range of resistance-free motion for comfort while hiking. Black Diamond Quadrant boots feature rockered rubber outsoles for good grip on snow and rock.","short_description":"The Black Diamond Quadrant randonee boots bring the downhill performance of a freeride boot together with the light weight of a touring boot so you can take your big skis into the backcountry.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Randonee Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s461515.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l461515.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=461515&tt=df","retail_price":"639.00","sale_price":"499.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=461515\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m461515.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=842270&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8422700001":{"sku":"8422700001","vendor_sku":"120113","upc":"793661170679","size":"Mondo 26.5","color":"HORNET GREEN","retail_price":"499.93","sale_price":"499.93"},"8422700002":{"sku":"8422700002","vendor_sku":"120113","upc":"793661170693","size":"Mondo 27.5","color":"HORNET GREEN","retail_price":"499.93","sale_price":"499.93"},"8422700003":{"sku":"8422700003","vendor_sku":"120113","upc":"484227000034","size":"Mondo 28.5","color":"HORNET GREEN","retail_price":"499.93","sale_price":"499.93"},"8422700004":{"sku":"8422700004","vendor_sku":"120113","upc":"484227000041","size":"Mondo 29.5","color":"HORNET GREEN","retail_price":"499.93","sale_price":"499.93"}},"categories":["snow","ski-boots","randonee-ski-boots"]}
