{"sku":"799444","manufacturer_id":"OFFM004","brand_name":"Metolius","product_name":"Metolius Offset Master Cams","long_description":"Metolius Offset Master cams are designed to fit where other cams won't. So, the next time you come upon a pin scar or flaring crack, place one of these and keep climbing. Offset Master cams feature 2 small lobes and 2 large lobes, making the cam ideal for flaring cracks, pin scars and pockets. Single-stem design allows cams to fit into tight spots; flexible cable reduces walking and enables placement in horizontal cracks. Long body provides excellent reach when top-stepping in aiders and stretching for hard-to-reach placements. Ergonomic thumb piece creates excellent control while placing and removing cams. Green, yellow and red Range Finder markings tell you at a glance if you've chosen the right size cam for the crack. Lightweight Dyneema nylon slings are color-coded for quick, easy identification. Hand-built and tested by Metolius in Bend, Oregon.","short_description":"Metolius Offset Master cams are designed to fit where other cams won't.
