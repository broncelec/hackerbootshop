{"sku":"865044","manufacturer_id":"A4L3J1X","brand_name":"The North Face","product_name":" The North Face ThermoBall Hybrid Jacket - Women's","long_description":"The North Face ThermoBall(TM) Hybrid Jacket for women warms your core with revolutionary new ThermoBall(TM) insulation. Soft-shell panels stretch and breathe with you as you play hard. Functioning like down feathers, the tiny round clusters of ThermoBall spun polyester trap warm air, while softly conforming to your body's shape. ThermoBall retains 80% of its insulating power even when dampened by rain, humidity or sweat, so you'll continue to stay warm. Small baffles in shell fabric allow insulation to fully expand to retain body heat; highly compressible ThermoBall insulation offers warmth equal to 600-fill-power goose down. Tightly woven nylon shell features diamond stitching that helps hold insulation in place to keep it evenly distributed; durable water repellent finish repels light moisture. Stretch panels at sides, hem and sleeves increase mobility for climbing, skiing or hiking. Zippered hand pockets; full-length front zipper with internal windflap; stretch-bound cuffs; low-profile drawcord hem. The North Face ThermoBall Hybrid Jacket for women has a standard fit and is machine washable. ThermoBall jackets were thoroughly tested by The North Face athletes, including Conrad Anker and Jimmy Chin, during summit trips on Denali and Mount Meru.","short_description":"The North Face ThermoBall(TM) Hybrid Jacket for women warms your core with revolutionary new ThermoBall(TM) insulation.
