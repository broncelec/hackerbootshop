Made of a water- and wind-resistant polyurethane-coated nylon shell with clear water-resistant, thermoplastic urethane window so children can see out and you can see in. Vents are positioned to allow proper airflow while keeping your children dry. Designed specifically for BOB Sport Utility Duallie strollers, sold separately. Please note: stroller canopy must be in correct position for proper Weather Shield installation; 2011 and newer strollers have rip-and-stick tabs to facilitate this. Older strollers must use retrofit kit to replace the canopy drawcord; kit can be obtained from BOB by contacting their customer service department.","short_description":"Offering protection from the weather, the BOB Sport Utility Duallie Stroller weather shield helps keep passengers comfortable and out of the elements.","category":"Fitness","subcategory":"Running","product_group":"Strollers","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s427467.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l427467.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=427467&tt=df","retail_price":"69.00","sale_price":"69.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=427467\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m427467.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=832058&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8320580001":{"sku":"8320580001","vendor_sku":"WS1102","upc":"692176705508","retail_price":"69.00","sale_price":"69.00"}},"categories":["fitness","running","strollers"]}
