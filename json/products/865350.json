{"sku":"865350","manufacturer_id":"BTMWPRR14","brand_name":"Big Agnes","product_name":" Big Agnes Pristine Sleeping Bag - Women's","long_description":"Insulated with Pinneco Core(R) synthetic fill, the women's Big Agnes Pristine Sleeping Bag will keep you toasty down to about 17degF, making it a great choice for 3-season backpacking. Pinneco Core synthetic insulation is designed to keep you warm with a CoreScreen(TM) heat-reflective layer that is sandwiched between 2 layers of insulation. CoreScreen reflects heat back to your body while allowing moisture to pass from the inside out so you stay dry. Insotect Tubic(TM) construction features internal Flow Gates(TM), which are vertical chambers with internal mesh gates that keep insulation from shifting up and down. Insotect Tubic tubular insulation system is engineered to provide the maximum cubic loft for excellent warmth. Mummy-style bag features full insulation on the bag's underside with no integrated pad sleeve like on other Big Agnes bags. 2-way, full-length YKK zipper zips to other bags of opposite configuration. Draft collar around the neck and a draft dube behind the zipper prevent cold air form sneaking in. Included interior fabric loops for attaching a sleeping bag liner (liner not included). The Big Agnes Pristine Sleeping Bag includes a mesh storage sack and a nylon stuff sack.","short_description":"Insulated with Pinneco Core(R) synthetic fill, the women's Big Agnes Pristine Sleeping Bag will keep you toasty down to about 17degF, making it a great choice for 3-season backpacking.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags And Accessories","product_group":"Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s421715.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l421715.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=421715&tt=df","keywords":"compact","retail_price":"229.95","sale_price":"229.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=421715\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m421715.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=865350&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8653500001":{"sku":"8653500001","vendor_sku":"BTMWPPR14","upc":"873840011570","size":"Petite Right","color":"CLARET/GRAY","retail_price":"209.95","sale_price":"209.95"},"8653500002":{"sku":"8653500002","vendor_sku":"BTMWPRR14","upc":"873840011587","size":"Regular Right","color":"CLARET/GRAY","retail_price":"229.95","sale_price":"229.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sleeping-bags-and-accessories","sleeping-bags"]}
