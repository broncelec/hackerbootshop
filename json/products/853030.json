Boys can combine the shell jacket and liner jacket for maximum protection, or wear either piece alone as conditions warrant. Fully seam-sealed polyester shell jacket uses HyVent(TM) 2-layer coating for waterproof, breathable protection. Detachable hood is fully adjustable to ensure a weather-blocking, personalized fit. Body features a smooth mesh lining to wick away moisture and ease layering. Shell jacket features a powder skirt, drawcord hem, detachable hood, rip-and-stick cuffs, zippered handwarmer pockets, chest pocket, internal media pocket and goggles cloth. Zip in/out polyester liner jacket uses 150g Heatseeker(TM) Aero polyfiber insulation to keep him warm without inhibiting mobility. The North Face Boundary Triclimate 3-in-1 insulated jacket's zip-in attachment system secures liner and shell together while preserving access to the shell's interior features.","short_description":"The North Face Boundary Triclimate 3-in-1 insulated and waterproof jacket for boys steps up to handle all kinds of changes in the weather-no need to come inside for extra layers!","category":"Kids'","subcategory":"Skiwear And Snowboard -- Boys And Girls","product_group":"Kids' Parkas","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s326999.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l326999.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=326999&tt=df","keywords":"warm,child,snowboard,coldweather,clothing","retail_price":"170.00","sale_price":"170.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=326999\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m326999.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=853030&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{},"extended_xml_attributes":"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"}
