{"sku":"864092","manufacturer_id":"23030-9197","brand_name":"Marmot","product_name":" Marmot Lithium Sleeping Bag","long_description":"Built for year-round backpacking and winter camping trips where space and weight are at a premium, the Marmot Lithium Sleeping Bag has toasty 850-fill goose down that's treated to fend off moisture. With a European Norm (EN) lower-limit rating of 6.1degF, the Lithium Sleeping Bag is suitable for 4-season use when temperatures dip into single digits. Lofty, premium 850-fill-power goose down offers superb warmth for minimal weight; meticulously cleaned and processed for hypo-allergenic qualities. Down is treated to resist moisture to retain warmth; treated down stays drier 10 times longer, maintains 150% more loft and dries 30% faster than untreated down. Nautilus 3D 6-baffle hood envelops your head in warmth; down gasket face muff allows hood to be cinched snug without digging into your face. Down-insulated draft collar and down-filled draft tube backing the snag-free zipper seal out cold air. Ground-level side seams eliminate cold air leaks and allow the goose down insulation to loft fully. Trapezoidal footbox is wider in the toe area and narrower in the heels to match the shape of your feet. Stretch tricot baffles allow the bag to be stuffed and unstuffed without tearing the baffle material. Lightweight Pertex(R) Microlight fabric stands up to abrasion and won't let the down escape. Zipper guards prevent zipper snags; locking zippers keep bag from opening if you toss and turn at night. Marmot Litihium Sleeping Bag comes with a stuff sack and a storage bag. European Norm (EN) is an independent third-party temperature rating, allowing accurate comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags.","short_description":"Built for year-round backpacking and winter camping trips where space and weight are at a premium, the Marmot Lithium Sleeping Bag has toasty 850-fill goose down that's treated to fend off moisture.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags And Accessories","product_group":"Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s421603.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l421603.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=421603&tt=df","keywords":"compact","retail_price":"509.00","sale_price":"509.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=421603\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m421603.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=864092&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8640920002":{"sku":"8640920002","vendor_sku":"23030-9197","upc":"785562500747","size":"Long Left","color":"SUNSET ORANGE/ORANGE SPIC","retail_price":"509.00","sale_price":"509.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sleeping-bags-and-accessories","sleeping-bags"]}
