{"sku":"866810","manufacturer_id":"203600","brand_name":"Thule","product_name":"Thule Chasm Duffel - X-Large","long_description":"With a whale of a mouth and removable backpack straps, the rugged, weather-resistant Thule Chasm Duffel in X-Large is your go-to gear hauler for any adventure. Oversized, wide-mouth opening makes it easy to pack and easy to get to your gear; side access makes it easy to reach the main compartment from any angle. Included padded shoulder straps attach to quickly convert the duffel to a backpack; duffel straps snap down cleanly along the side of the duffel so they don't flap around. Exterior compression straps keep gear inside duffel from falling to the lower end when carried in vertical backpack mode. Interior zippered mesh pockets and an exterior zippered pocket organize smaller stuff. Padded bottom cushions your gear; locking zippers deter thieves (lock sold separately). Durable, waterproof tarpaulin fabric stands up on its own for easy packing. Thule Chasm Duffel in X-Large holds 130 liters of gear, enough for an adventure of a couple weeks.","short_description":"With a whale of a mouth and removable backpack straps, the rugged, weather-resistant Thule Chasm Duffel in X-Large is your go-to gear hauler for any adventure.","category":"Travel And Luggage","subcategory":"Luggage","product_group":"Travel Duffels","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s463887.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l463887.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=463887&tt=df","retail_price":"159.95","sale_price":"159.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=463887\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m463887.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=866810&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8668100001":{"sku":"8668100001","vendor_sku":"203500","upc":"091021946804","color":"COBALT","retail_price":"159.95","sale_price":"159.95"},"8668100002":{"sku":"8668100002","vendor_sku":"203300","upc":"091021631106","color":"DARK SHADOW","retail_price":"159.95","sale_price":"159.95"},"8668100003":{"sku":"8668100003","vendor_sku":"203600","upc":"091021423923","color":"ZINNIA","retail_price":"159.95","sale_price":"159.95"}},"categories":["travel","luggage","travel-duffels"]}
