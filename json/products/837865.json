{"sku":"837865","manufacturer_id":"14079","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":"REI Fall Line 35 Snow Pack","long_description":"The REI Fall Line 35 snow pack is your ticket to untracked powder. Sized right for day trips, the main compartment provides room for probe, skins, food, safety essentials and extra layers of clothing. Front zippered pocket is sized for a shovel blade, and it features a sleeve for the handle. Tarpaulin liner in pocket resists moisture and abrasion. Zippered back panel entry lets you access your gear and hydration reservoir (not included), even with your skis or board attached. Back panel material sheds snow and dries quickly. Skis carry diagonally across the front of the pack, and snowboards and snowshoes carry vertically down the center; straps tuck away. Padded front panel and tough reinforcement patches prevent damage from skis and snowboards. Mesh sling zips out to carry your helmet on the trip up and tucks away when not in use; redesigned sling offers access to tool pocket while your helmet is attached. Hydration pocket is designed to accept most hydration reservoirs, not included. Insulated sleeve on shoulder strap stores the hydration hose to help prevent freeze-up and is large enough to accommodate right-angle shut-off valves. Lightweight spring steel frame supports a gear-heavy outing, and it responds well to the movement of skiing and riding. Hipbelt snugs comfortably to help distribute weight to your hips, not your back; hipbelt features 2 pockets for easy access to small items. Hipbelt webbing system adjusts with a forward pull, creating a secure, ergonomic fit. Compression straps help stabilize gear for security and comfortable carriage. Snow-specific buckles are designed to work well with gloves on and to prevent clogging with snow.","short_description":"The REI Fall Line 35 snow pack is your ticket to untracked powder.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Packs And Bags","product_group":"Ski Packs","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s259927.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l259927.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=259927&tt=df","keywords":"small,backpack,pack","retail_price":"75.93","sale_price":"53.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=259927\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m259927.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=837865&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8378650001":{"sku":"8378650001","vendor_sku":"14079","upc":"483786500016","color":"CORINTHIAN BLUE","retail_price":"53.83","sale_price":"53.83"}}}
