{"sku":"866352","manufacturer_id":"14-14-2223","brand_name":"Raleigh","product_name":"Raleigh Talus 29er Comp Bike - 2014","long_description":"The Raleigh Talus 29er Comp hardtail mountain bike delivers big-wheeled 29er performance with a RockShox fork, Shimano drivetrain and hydraulic disc brakes. RockShox XC 32 suspension fork supplies 100mm of responsive travel to smooth out rough trails; suspension can be locked out when not needed. Shimano drivetrain features triple cranks, an 11-34 cassette and responsive Deore derailleurs; Alivio trigger shifters deliver snappy, precise shifts through the 27 gears. Shimano hydraulic disc brakes deliver solid stopping power and smooth deceleration no matter the conditions. Butted aluminum frame features a formed down tube and CNC-machined, tapered head tube for excellent strength. Updated frame geometry lowers the center of gravity for a more comfortable ride. Weinmann U28 rims are outfitted with the versatile Kenda Slant Six tires for good grip, confident cornering and fast-rolling performance. Bike includes a basic set of alloy platform pedals (pedals not pictured).
