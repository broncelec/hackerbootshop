{"sku":"859343","manufacturer_id":"S130303401169","brand_name":"K2","product_name":"K2 Remedy 117 Skis - Women's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Ready for heavy snowfall, switch landings and freestyle tricks, the women's K2 Remedy 117 skis feature rockered twin tips to help you make the most of epic powder days. 117mm waists and rockered tips designed for powder offer unparalleled performance in deep snow, and camber underfoot offers edge grip on the way back to the lifts. Slightly lower rockered tails offer a large landing platform, ideal for hucking cliffs and jumps. K2 women's skis reduce the bulk and weight of all components to create very lightweight skis suited to the specific needs of female skiers. The stiffest core in K2's women's skis, Bioflex3 core combines aspen, paulownia and bamboo woods to deliver instant response and high durability. A fiberglass weave around the wood core provides torsional stiffness for highly responsive turning. Directional twin tip heavily favors skiing forward but allows you to ski and land jumps backward if desired. The widest point of the tips is placed further back than on other K2 skis to reduce the tendency of skis to hook in light crust and throw you off balance. Use tip and tail holes to attach skins (sold separately); remove plugs with a flathead screwdriver. 117mm waist requires bindings with wide brakes. Base or topsheet color of the women's K2 Remedy 117 skis may vary from online photo.","short_description":"Ready for heavy snowfall, switch landings and freestyle tricks, the women's K2 Remedy 117 skis feature rockered twin tips to help you make the most of epic powder days.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382087.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382087.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382087&tt=df","retail_price":"699.95","sale_price":"419.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382087\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382087.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859343&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8593430001":{"sku":"8593430001","vendor_sku":"S130303401169","upc":"886745164470","size":"169 CM","retail_price":"419.93","sale_price":"419.93"},"8593430002":{"sku":"8593430002","vendor_sku":"S130303401179","upc":"886745164494","size":"179 CM","retail_price":"419.93","sale_price":"419.93"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
