Arione K:ium is designed to offer support for those with good flexibility-when bent forward fully, one's hands can easily touch toes. Synthetic Microtex cover is durable, water resistant and washable, and will not fade; plus, it's lighter than leather. Central channel spans the length of the saddle to offer a relief zone for sensitive tissues. Nylon/carbon-reinforced shell provides lightweight support and comfort.
