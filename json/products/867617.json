{"sku":"867617","manufacturer_id":"010-00994-00","brand_name":"Garmin","product_name":"Garmin Vector Power Meter Pedal Kit","long_description":"A much-anticipated Garmin power meter that measures output at the pedal where force is applied, Vector Power Meter Pedal Kit captures rich training data with unique, powerful and precise technology. Vector measures the slight deflection of the pedal spindle through your entire pedal stroke, measuring the force vectors and using this data to calculate power. Because the force sensors are housed in each pedal, Vector can measure power from each leg and report total power as well as the balance between your right and left leg. Vector also records cadence and a variety of power metrics, which you can see on your compatible Garmin device (sold separately) and online with Garmin Connect(TM). Also measures average power at various time intervals, power in watts, overall kilojoules, power zones and specialized measurements such as intensity and training stress. Easily transferable, you can use the same system on multiple bikes by simply swapping out the pedals and moving the wireless head unit. Installs in minutes. Please note that this pedal kit requires a compatible ANT+ receiver, such as the Garmin 810 GPS Bike Computer, sold separately. Also compatable with the Garmin Edge 500, 510, 800 and the Garmin Forerunner 310XT and Forerunner 910XT, not included. Includes LOOK Keo-compatible cleats with 6deg float, or install your own cleats. Battery life of 175 hrs.; includes a user-replaceable 2032 coin cell for each pedal. The Garmin Vector Road Bike Power Meter Pedal Kit includes Vector pedals, pedal pods, cleats and hardware, USB ANT+ stick for firmware updates and manuals.","short_description":"A much-anticipated Garmin power meter that measures output at the pedal where force is applied, Vector Power Meter Pedal Kit captures rich training data with unique, powerful and precise technology.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Accessories","product_group":"Bike Computers","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s449783.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l449783.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=449783&tt=df","retail_price":"1699.95","sale_price":"1699.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=449783\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m449783.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=867617&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8676170001":{"sku":"8676170001","vendor_sku":"010-00994-00","upc":"753759982591","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"1699.95","sale_price":"1699.95"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-accessories","bike-computers"]}
