{"sku":"867678","manufacturer_id":"E790400703290","brand_name":"Edelrid","product_name":"Edelrid Raptor DuoTec Bi-Color 9.7mm x 70m Dry Rope","long_description":"The Edelrid Raptor DuoTec Bi-Color 9.7mm x 70m Dry Rope is treated to fend off moisture and dirt for your climbing trips to the sport crag and into the alpine. Pro Shield finish covers every last core and sheath yarn with a synthetic fluoropolymer coating, creating an impermeable protective layer; finish is nontoxic. Pro Shield reduces friction between individual yarns, which improves the rope's loading properties; finish also helps protect the rope against moisture and dirt. Dry Shield chemical finish protects the sheath and core yarns against moisture and dirt; finish resists washing out and improves the lifespan of the rope. Thermo Shield treatment employs a heat process to stabilize individual yarns, ensuring the rope stays supple throughout its working lifetime. 9.7mm diameter keeps the weight down to 61g per meter, making this rope ideal for climbs that require a long approach. 70m length lets you climb modern sport routes and do long rappels in the mountains. DuoTec bi-color marking is easily visible from a variety of angles and enhances rope management. Kernmantle design features a stretchy core protected by a durable outer sheath which combine for strength and good handling. The Edelrid Raptor DuoTec Bi-Color 9.7mm x 70m Dry Climbing Rope meets UIAA tests for falls, impact force and elongation.","short_description":"The Edelrid Raptor DuoTec Bi-Color 9.7mm x 70m Dry Rope is treated to fend off moisture and dirt for your climbing trips to the sport crag and into the alpine.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Ropes","product_group":"Single Ropes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s363159.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l363159.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=363159&tt=df","keywords":"dynamic","retail_price":"239.95","sale_price":"239.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=363159\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m363159.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=867678&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8676780001":{"sku":"8676780001","vendor_sku":"E790400703290","size":"9.7 MM X 70 M","color":"ICEMINT","retail_price":"239.95","sale_price":"239.95"}},"categories":["climbing","climbing-ropes","single-ropes"]}
