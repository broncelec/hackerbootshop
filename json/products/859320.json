Dual titanal laminate offers unwavering stability at high speeds by absorbing bumps and responding quickly to high-speed maneuvers. Rockered tips initiate turns easily and offer agile performance on all kinds of terrain, and slight camber underfoot offers tenacious edge hold on firm snow. Durable fir-and-aspen wood core produces smooth, natural flex, and a shock-absorbent secondary core smooths out your ride. Secondary core is wrapped in a carbon web for an additional level of torsional rigidity to increase edge hold from tip to tail. Integrated wide bindings help transfer power directly to the ski for unmatched precision, edge hold and control during aggressive descents. K2 AMP Rictor 90 XTi skis with bindings feature DIN 4 - 12 release settings, a range suited to intermediate to advanced skiers at medium to high speeds. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.","short_description":"Built for advanced skiers who prefer the do-anything stability of a 90mm waist, the K2 AMP Rictor 90 XTi skis with bindings offer precise control at high speeds on any type of snow.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s439819.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l439819.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=439819&tt=df","retail_price":"949.95","sale_price":"569.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=439819\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m439819.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859320&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8593200003":{"sku":"8593200003","vendor_sku":"S130600801184","upc":"886745161738","size":"184 CM","retail_price":"569.93","sale_price":"569.93"}}}
