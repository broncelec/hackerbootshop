High-quality LED outputs 134 lumens and throws a beam up to 388m to light up your nighttime adventures. Just like with the original Maglite, a simple press of a button turns the light on and off; twisting the head focuses the beam from spot to flood. Rugged anodized aluminum construction resists water and corrosion. O-ring seals keep moisture out.
