{"sku":"800334","manufacturer_id":"139 300 521","brand_name":"Native Eyewear","product_name":" Native Eyewear Vigor Reflex Polarized Sunglasses - Men's","long_description":"Featuring enhanced glare reduction, the Native Eyewear Vigor Reflex polarized interchangeable sunglasses deliver weightless comfort, maximum protection and stylish looks. A unique interchangeable lens system lets you switch lenses without having to put your fingers all over them. Iron frames include 1 set of polarized Reflex Silver (gray tinted) lenses and 1 set of SportFlex(TM) lenses, for a total of 2 sets of lenses. Polarized Reflex(TM) lenses provide superior glare reduction and enhanced styling. Polarized Silver Reflex lenses work well for all light conditions, especially extremely bright sunlight because the Reflex coating blocks more light. Additional SportFlex orange-yellow lenses have a blue mirror coating suitable for cloudy or overcast days, and dusk and dawn. Polarized Crystal Carbonate(R) (P.C.C.) lenses have the strongest hard coating available to protect against scratching. P.C.C. lenses pass the rigorous ANSI Z80.3 tests for optical clarity and impact resistance and block 100% of harmful UVA and UVB light. Rhyno-Tuff(R) AIR frames endure extreme highs and lows in temperature. Venting system incorporated into the frames enhances airflow and virtually eliminates fog and condensation. Self-adjusting Cushinol(TM) nose pads create a non-slip grip that keeps sunglasses in place, ensuring a soft feel and personalized fit. Mastoid Temple Grip design ensures the temple ends hug behind your ears to securely keep sunglasses in place. Anti-Ocular Intrusion System(R), a 4-point configuration, helps prevent lenses from shooting into your face in the event of high-velocity impact. Cam-action spring hinges quickly lock temples in position. The Native Vigor Reflex polarized sunglasses are sized to fit large faces. Optic Gear Kit Includes a semi-hard zip case and a soft protective pouch that doubles as a cleaning cloth.","short_description":"Featuring enhanced glare reduction, the Native Eyewear Vigor Reflex polarized interchangeable sunglasses deliver weightless comfort, maximum protection and stylish looks.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sunglasses","product_group":"Sport Sunglasses","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s422867.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l422867.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=422867&tt=df","keywords":"Cycling","retail_price":"139.00","sale_price":"139.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=422867\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m422867.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=800334&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8003340018":{"sku":"8003340018","vendor_sku":"139 300 521","upc":"764824007330","color":"IRON/SILVER REFLEX","retail_price":"139.00","sale_price":"139.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sunglasses","sport-sunglasses"]}
