{"sku":"808976","manufacturer_id":"53288","brand_name":"Camelbak","product_name":" CamelBak Stainless-Steel Groove Filter Water Bottle - 20 fl. oz.","long_description":"Use the CamelBak Stainless-Steel Groove(TM) Filter water bottle to turn your potable tap water into great-tasting water that you can enjoy while at home, in the office or on the go. Simply fill the bottle with tap water, screw the cap on and start sipping; the integrated plant-based carbon filter reduces chlorine taste and odors found in tap water. Filter is good for up to 3 mos. and is an easy way to enjoy tap water rather than purchasing disposable bottles of water. CamelBak Groove Filter bottle should be used to improve the taste of safe water sources only; filter does not remove viruses, bacteria or protozoa from water. Made of high-quality 18-8 stainless steel, the bottle is completely BPA-free; stainless steel stands up to regular use in the mountains or around town. Bypass the potential hazards of drinking from a wide opening-the CamelBak Groove bite valve virtually eliminates spills. Just bite and sip and the beverage flows through the valve-you don't even need to tip the bottle to drink. Bite valve has an articulating stem, so when not in use it folds down next to the bottle and stays clean. Carry the CamelBak Stainless-Steel Groove Filter bottle via the integrated handle, or connect it to a pack or waistbelt with a small carabiner, not included. Please note: bottle is single walled and not intended for use with hot liquids.","short_description":"Use the CamelBak Stainless-Steel Groove(TM) Filter water bottle to turn your potable tap water into great-tasting water that you can enjoy while at home, in the office or on the go.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Water Bottles And Treatment","product_group":"Water Bottles, Flasks And Jugs","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s425567.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l425567.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=425567&tt=df","retail_price":"30.00","sale_price":"30.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=425567\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m425567.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=808976&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8089760014":{"sku":"8089760014","vendor_sku":"53289","upc":"713852532895","color":"WHITE","retail_price":"30.00","sale_price":"30.00"},"8089760022":{"sku":"8089760022","vendor_sku":"53288","upc":"713852532888","color":"STAINLESS STEEL","retail_price":"30.00","sale_price":"30.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","water-bottles-and-treatment","water-bottles-flasks-and-jugs"]}
