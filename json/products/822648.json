{"sku":"822648","manufacturer_id":"M57 G","brand_name":"Petzl","product_name":" Petzl Ange S Wiregate Carabiner","long_description":"Reduce the weight of your rack and quickdraws with the Petzl Ange S Wiregate carabiner. It features an innovative MonoFil Keylock wiregate system that shaves weight and is smooth and easy to operate. MonoFil Keylock wiregate system blends the strength and fluidity of a standard spring gate with the lightness of a wiregate. Ange S Wiregate carabiner weighs only 28g-that's 21g lighter than the popular Petzl Spirit Straight Gate carabiner. Straight keylock nose lets you clip and unclip slings, bolt hangers, nuts and cams without snagging; hole in the nose allows ice, snow and dirt to be cleared out. Surfaces that come into contact with the climbing rope are wider than other parts of the carabiner for smooth passage of the rope and reduced wear on the 'biner. Indent at the bottom of the Ange S carabiner keeps a sling properly positioned. Black deflector at the bottom of the gate works with the shape of the carabiner to keep proper position of the 'biner on its major axis.","short_description":"Reduce the weight of your rack and quickdraws with the Petzl Ange S Wiregate carabiner.
