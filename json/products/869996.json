The ultralight carbon rim uses Firecrest(R) shaping to optimize the aerodynamic profile of both the front and back halves of the wheel. Wider rim profile increases side-to-side stiffness for responsive sprinting and cornering, as well as great control, crosswind stability, comfort, and strength. 18 spokes are laced radially onto the Zipp 88 hub, which uses Swiss-made cartridge bearings with extremely smooth-rolling grade 10 steel balls. The Zipp 404 Firecrest Carbon Clincher Front Wheel has a maximum tire pressure of 125 psi (8.62 bar). Please note: this wheel is clincher-compatible only and comes with a quick-release skewer, rim tape, valve extender, Tangente butyl tube and Platinum Pro brake pads. Zipp recommends a maximum weight of 250 lbs. (113kg) including rider, bike and gear.","short_description":"Weighing in at 715g, the highly anticipated Zipp 404 Firecrest Carbon Clincher Front Wheel offers serious cyclists the speed and durability of 2 yrs. of testing and design in top-performance carbon.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Components","product_group":"Bike Tires, Tubes And Wheels","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s389779.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l389779.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=389779&tt=df","retail_price":"1227.00","sale_price":"1227.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=389779\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m389779.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=869996&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8699960001":{"sku":"8699960001","vendor_sku":"00.1918.132.000","upc":"710845741104","size":"700C","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"1227.00","sale_price":"1227.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-components","bike-tires-tubes-and-wheels"]}
