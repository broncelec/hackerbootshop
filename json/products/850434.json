Bundle includes a 910XT wrist unit, premium HRM chest strap, GSC 10 speed/cadence sensor, quick-release kit, USB ANT stick, AC adapter, charge clip and expander wrist strap. Water resistant to 50m (165 ft.), 910XT handles open-water and pool swimming; watch measures swimming distance, identifies strokes and tracks strokes and pool lengths. Computes your \"Swim Golf\" (SWOLF) score, which is determined by adding the number of strokes taken per lap to the time it took to swim the lap, to help improve efficiency. On land, the 910XT uses GPS technology to accurately capture your time, distance, speed, pace and more to help you meet your running and biking goals. High-sensitivity GPS receiver stays locked onto satellites, even near tall buildings and under tree cover; HotFix(R) satellite prediction locks onto satellites quickly. GPS also captures the path you travel while swimming in open water so you can analyze it later to help improve your technique. Chest-strap heart rate monitor helps you train in your target zone to optimize performance while you run and bike; monitor can be worn in water but will not transmit data. Features an advanced calorie-consumption formula that calculates calories burned based on changes in the user's heart rate during aerobic activity. Virtual Racer(TM) feature lets you race against your previous best time or challenge other users' times that have been uploaded to the Garmin Connect(TM) website. Virtual Partner(R) allows you to compete against a static pace that you set before heading out for your run. Track the intensity of your workout with the Training Effect feature; Training Effect is calculated based on user profile, heart rate and difficulty of the activity.","short_description":"The Garmin Forerunner 910XT triathlon bundle offers the data and details you crave while swimming, biking and running.
