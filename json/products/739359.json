A combination of mineral waxes, flexible polymers and tanning agents condition and protect leather without over-softening or changing the fit. New formulation is 30% more durable for longer time between reapplications. Easy to apply--can be used on either wet or dry footwear; for best results apply to pre-dampened footwear. To use: clean boots; apply with included sponge applicator to footwear, wipe off excess, allow to dry away from direct heat; re-apply as needed.
