{"sku":"851477","manufacturer_id":"RST-PC2CB-220","brand_name":"Aqua-Bound","product_name":" Aqua-Bound Sting Ray Posi-Lok Kayak Paddle - Full Carbon","long_description":"The Aqua-Bound Sting Ray Posi-Lok carbon paddle is lightweight, tough and suited to the waters you've been dying to explore. Simple, intuitive and strong, the Posi-Lok(R) ferrule uses a 2-button release to detach and adjust feather angle. To join, simply slide the Posi-Lok ferrule together and listen for the audible \"click\". Posi-Lok resists corrosion and completely eliminates play between each piece of the paddle. Feathering is adjustable in the increments of 0 / 15 / 30 / 45 / 60deg right or left. Lightweight carbon shaft provides low swing weight and slight shaft flex, promoting a comfortable experience in the cockpit from launch until takeout. Carbon fiber blades are silky smooth in the water and offer enhanced stiffness and strength. Wide, asymmetrical dihedral blade face is optimized for low-angle paddling and produces a smooth stroke with minimal flutter. Rubber drip rings keep water away from hands and lap.","short_description":"The Aqua-Bound Sting Ray Posi-Lok carbon paddle is lightweight, tough and suited to the waters you've been dying to explore.","category":"Paddling","subcategory":"Paddles","product_group":"Kayak Paddles","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s431043.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l431043.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=431043&tt=df","retail_price":"189.95","sale_price":"189.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=431043\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m431043.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=851477&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8514770001":{"sku":"8514770001","vendor_sku":"RST-PC2CB-220","upc":"717320485164","size":"220 CM","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"189.95","sale_price":"189.95"},"8514770002":{"sku":"8514770002","vendor_sku":"RST-PC2CB-230","upc":"717320485171","size":"230 CM","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"189.95","sale_price":"189.95"},"8514770003":{"sku":"8514770003","vendor_sku":"RST-PC2CB-240","upc":"717320485188","size":"240 CM","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"189.95","sale_price":"189.95"}},"categories":["paddling","paddles","kayak-paddles"]}
