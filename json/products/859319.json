Dual titanal laminate absorbs bumps and responds quickly to high-speed maneuvers with unwavering stability. Rockered tips initiate turns easily and offer agile performance on all kinds of terrain, and slight camber underfoot offers tenacious edge hold on firm snow. Durable fir-and-aspen wood core produces smooth, natural flex, and a shock-absorbent secondary core smooths out your ride. Secondary core is wrapped in a carbon web for an additional level of torsional rigidity to increase edge hold from tip to tail. Integrated wide bindings help transfer power directly to the ski for unmatched precision, edge hold and control during aggressive descents. K2 AMP 80 XTi skis with bindings feature DIN 4 - 12 release settings, a range suited to intermediate to advanced skiers at medium to high speeds. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.","short_description":"Souped up with a stabilizing metal laminate built into the skis, the K2 AMP 80 XTi skis with bindings offer advanced skiers the versatility to take on any groomed terrain at high speed.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382023.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382023.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382023&tt=df","retail_price":"799.95","sale_price":"479.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382023\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382023.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859319&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8593190001":{"sku":"8593190001","vendor_sku":"S130601401163","upc":"886745162315","size":"163 CM","retail_price":"479.93","sale_price":"479.93"},"8593190002":{"sku":"8593190002","vendor_sku":"S130601401170","upc":"886745162346","size":"170 CM","retail_price":"479.93","sale_price":"479.93"},"8593190003":{"sku":"8593190003","vendor_sku":"S130601401177","upc":"886745162377","size":"177 CM","retail_price":"479.93","sale_price":"479.93"}}}
