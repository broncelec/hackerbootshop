{"sku":"846411","manufacturer_id":"016075-699-1-O/","brand_name":"Osprey","product_name":"Osprey Volt 75 Pack","long_description":"Hit the wilderness with the light, simple and value-conscious Osprey Volt 75 pack. Enjoy its comfortable fit with all the essential features, but without extraneous bells and whistles. Torso length adjusts easily and precisely over a 5 in. range to provide an exact fit; extra pads on the dual-density hipbelt extend up to 3 in. on each side. Lumbar pad and back panel are covered in spacer mesh for enhanced cushioning and ventilation. Peripheral-hoop alloy frame provides a light and flexible structure that effectively transfers load weight to the hipbelt. Top-loading design features a floating lid that extends to handle bulky gear and overloads; externally accessible lower compartment accommodates a sleeping bag. External hydration sleeve in the back panel simplifies refilling and helps protect pack contents from spills (hydration reservoir sold separately). Trekking pole attachment lets you stow and remove poles on the go; poles tuck between your arm and pack with a side loop and an adjustable shockcord on the left shoulder strap. Zippered lid pocket, 1 front and 2 side stretch-woven pockets and zippered hipbelt pockets make it easy to organize and access often-used gear. 2 ice axe loops let you lash tools or extra gear on the outside of the pack. Side compression straps let you cinch down loads for jostle-free carrying; sleeping pad straps on the pack's base adjust easily to hold a variety of shapes and sizes of pads. The Osprey Volt 75 pack body is made of 210-denier double ripstop nylon; pack base is made of 600-denier polyester.","short_description":"Hit the wilderness with the light, simple and value-conscious Osprey Volt 75 pack.
