Mineral-based sunscreen contains 20% zinc oxide for broad-spectrum UVA and UVB protection. Formula is very water resistant so it won't come off easily while you're swimming or sweating. Thinksport sunscreen is a physical sunscreen, meaning it works immediately upon contact as opposed to chemical sunscreens, which require application prior to exposure to sun. Applies easily and absorbs quickly. 3 fl. oz. bottle is approved by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) for carry-on baggage. Thinksport SPF 50 sunscreen does not contain chemical UV absorbers, PABA, parabens or BPA.","short_description":"Use Thinksport SPF 50 Kids' sunscreen to protect your children from the sun while they enjoy a midday hike or paddling session.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Health And Safety","product_group":"Sun And Bug Protection","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s420947.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l420947.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=420947&tt=df","retail_price":"12.95","sale_price":"12.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=420947\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m420947.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=851542&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8515420001":{"sku":"8515420001","vendor_sku":"TSKIDS3","upc":"890397002790","retail_price":"12.95","sale_price":"12.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","health-and-safety","sun-and-bug-protection"]}
