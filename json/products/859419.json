{"sku":"859419","manufacturer_id":"0A330600 001","brand_name":"Nordica","product_name":"Nordica Patron Skis - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Stable and smooth in all conditions, the powder-loving Nordica Patron skis use a chatter-reducing tip design, 113mm waists, and a powder-specific rockered profile to surf deep snow. 113mm waists offer ample flotation, and early-rise tips and tails enhance maneuverability in deep snow. Powerful wood core with glass and carbon reinforcements produces a lightweight ski with playful responsiveness. Cambered and rockered profile enhances handling in deep snow, making it easy to take advantage of every feature on the mountain. Standard camber underfoot enhances maneuverability on groomers and variable snow; when weighted, 50% of the ski contacts the snow. Low, broad nose extends over the snow just enough to enhance flotation without becoming really noisy and vibrating on groomed terrain at high speeds. Directional twin-tip taper slightly favors skiing forward, but it also lets you ride switch and land jumps backward. Nordica Patron skis feature 113mm waists that require bindings with wide brakes. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.","short_description":"Stable and smooth in all conditions, the powder-loving Nordica Patron skis use a chatter-reducing tip design, 113mm waists, and a powder-specific rockered profile to surf deep snow.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382167.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382167.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382167&tt=df","retail_price":"749.00","sale_price":"523.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382167\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382167.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859419&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8594190001":{"sku":"8594190001","vendor_sku":"0A330600 001","upc":"885315547064","size":"177 CM","color":"GREEN","retail_price":"523.83","sale_price":"523.83"},"8594190002":{"sku":"8594190002","vendor_sku":"0A330600 001","upc":"885315547071","size":"185 CM","color":"GREEN","retail_price":"523.83","sale_price":"523.83"},"8594190003":{"sku":"8594190003","vendor_sku":"0A330600 001","upc":"885315547088","size":"193 CM","color":"GREEN","retail_price":"523.83","sale_price":"523.83"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
