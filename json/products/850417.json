{"sku":"850417","manufacturer_id":"FB13CB102","brand_name":"Folbot","product_name":" Folbot Citibot 100 Folding Kayak","long_description":"Whether you bring it hiking, biking or exploring urban waterways, the portable Folbot Citibot 100 folding kayak goes where hard-shell kayaks can only dream about. Maybe you can't store a hard-shell at home, or maybe you want to explore local waters like a beach or a lake; either way, you'll want a Folbot. It sets up in about 10 min., and folds up into a pack that you can store in your gear closet or your car's trunk. Thanks to a clever tensioning device in the rear of the kayak, you can first assemble the frame and then insert it into the skin, streamlining the set-up process. The Citibot 100 is easy to manage on calm waters, and it offers excellent stability and surprisingly responsive tracking for a boat of its size. Used by roofers, the military and whitewater-raft makers, a synthetic rubber material called Elvaloy is tough like a rhino's hide and protects the hull of the Citibot. Urethane-coated polyester protects the decks; all outer materials on the Folbot Citbot resist UV light and are designed to take a beating without puncturing. Frame of the Citibot is just as sturdy as its skin, with stainless-steel keel brackets (say that 3 times fast), aircraft-grade tubing and anodized aluminum cross pieces. Inflatable chambers called sponsons run the full length of the boat to increase tension and lock frame pieces into place; sponsons also flare out the hull to enhance stability. Seat and footpegs adjust to create a comfortable position in the cockpit. Easy-to-open zippers with high-strength zipper heads offer access to interior of kayak; rip-and-stick stormflaps and water-resistant closures keep things sealed up tight. Solid aluminum strip protects the bow and stern keels. What's included? Your kayak will come inside its backpack with skin, frame, 2 foot braces, 2 air sponsons, 2 safety bladders, and inflatable seat.","short_description":"Whether you bring it hiking, biking or exploring urban waterways, the portable Folbot Citibot 100 folding kayak goes where hard-shell kayaks can only dream about.","category":"Paddling","subcategory":"Kayaks","product_group":"Folding Kayaks","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s430519.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l430519.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=430519&tt=df","retail_price":"999.00","sale_price":"848.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=430519\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m430519.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=850417&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8504170001":{"sku":"8504170001","vendor_sku":"FB13CB102","upc":"610373015572","color":"YELLOW/GRAY","retail_price":"848.93","sale_price":"848.93"}},"categories":["paddling","kayaks","folding-kayaks"]}
