{"sku":"855896","manufacturer_id":"10000100","brand_name":"Burton","product_name":" Burton AK 2L Cyclic Shell Pants - Men's","long_description":"The Burton AK 2L Cyclic pants take the tried-and-true Gore-Tex(R) waterproof membrane and combine it with backcountry-tested fit and features to create snow pants that lives up to the hype. Waterproof, breathable, windproof Gore-Tex laminate provides an excellent defense against heat-robbing moisture and windchill. Fully taped seams with Gore-Tex tape create the ultimate seal against wind and snow. Mesh-lined inner thigh vents keep you dry and comfortable whether you're hiking the pipe or riding the lift. Hand pockets, zippered rear pockets and a zippered thigh pocket hold all your essentials for a day of riding. Internal waist adjustment tabs personalize the fit; they lay flat to maximize your comfort. Soft microfleece fly and waistband lining let you ride with your shirt untucked with no worries about pinching or chafing; antimicrobial finish helps keep odors at bay. Stretch gaiters with lace hooks help prevent snow from getting into boots, even in deep powder. Zippers in hems make getting your boots on and off easy, and add a relaxed look and feel. Snap-up leg lifts let you raise and secure pant cuffs, protecting the pants from parking lot carnage. Special interface connects pants to compatible Burton jackets (sold separately) to ensure snow stays outside. Burton AK 2L Cyclic pants have an articulated fit with a pattern engineered to mimic the body's natural flex when riding and hiking, which allows great mobility.","short_description":"The Burton AK 2L Cyclic pants take the tried-and-true Gore-Tex(R) waterproof membrane and combine it with backcountry-tested fit and features to create snow pants that lives up to the hype.","category":"Men's Clothing","subcategory":"Men's Pants","product_group":"Men's Snow Pants","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s403739.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l403739.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=403739&tt=df","keywords":"hardshell","retail_price":"320.00","sale_price":"239.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=403739\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m403739.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=855896&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8558960006":{"sku":"8558960006","vendor_sku":"10000100","upc":"886888550307","size":"M","color":"TRUE PENNY","retail_price":"239.93","sale_price":"239.93"},"8558960007":{"sku":"8558960007","vendor_sku":"10000100","upc":"886888550291","size":"L","color":"TRUE PENNY","retail_price":"239.93","sale_price":"239.93"},"8558960008":{"sku":"8558960008","vendor_sku":"10000100","upc":"886888550321","size":"XL","color":"TRUE PENNY","retail_price":"239.93","sale_price":"239.93"}},"categories":["mens","mens-pants","mens-snow-pants"]}
