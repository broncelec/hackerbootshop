FlashDry microparticles are embedded in the insulation to dramatically improve dry time and breathability. Made of crushed coconut shells and crushed volcanic rock, the FlashDry additive leads to faster dry times and will not wash out. Fully taped seams create the ultimate seal against wind and snow. Rip-and-stick adjustment tabs at side of waist and zippered, snap-closure fly secure the fit. Inner thigh vents and internal leg gaiters with stretch-mesh gussets control airflow and temperature; zipper vents are waterproof and bonded. 2 handwarmer pockets and a thigh cargo pocket with a waterproof, bonded zipper keep accessories organized. Pant-a-locks tabs secure Kannon pants to coordinating jackets from The North Face (not included). Reinforced edge guards resist abrasion from boots, boards and skis. Embedded RECCO(R) reflector enhances radio signals from search-and-rescue RECCO detectors for quicker acquisition of position in an avalanche. From The North Face Summit Series(TM), featuring cutting-edge fabrics and the most advanced technology for the ambitious, technical skier or rider.
