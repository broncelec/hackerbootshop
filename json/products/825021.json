{"sku":"825021","manufacturer_id":"608-130-10","brand_name":"Voile","product_name":"Voile Switchback X2 Telemark Touring Bindings - Short","long_description":"The short Voile Switchback X2 telemark touring bindings have a powerful feel designed to meet the demands of modern backcountry skiers who wear 4-buckle boots and ride on fat skis. Compared with original Voile Switchback bindings, the X2 bindings feature 25% stiffer cartridges and pivot points that have been moved back 1.125 in. for increased power. Bindings let you easily switch between free-pivot touring mode and downhill telemark mode with the use of a ski pole. Free-pivot mechanism is designed to resist ice and snow buildup for hassle-free touring. Weighing in at 3 lbs. 3 oz. per pair, the X2 bindings are the second lightest free-pivot bindings on the market (behind only the original Voile Switchback). Full wraparound stainless-steel toe plates stand up to regular backcountry use. Include 2 climbing wires that lift your heels 65mm and 100mm to take the strain of your legs while skinning up hills. Spinning spring cartridges allow easy length adjustments; stainless-steel hooks and rods add strength and durability. Voile Switchback X2 telemark touring bindings with short-length rods fit boot sizes 24 - 26.5 mondo.","short_description":"The short Voile Switchback X2 telemark touring bindings have a powerful feel designed to meet the demands of modern backcountry skiers who wear 4-buckle boots and ride on fat skis.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Bindings","product_group":"Telemark Ski Bindings","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s381739.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l381739.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=381739&tt=df","retail_price":"299.00","sale_price":"299.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=381739\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m381739.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=825021&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8250210001":{"sku":"8250210001","vendor_sku":"608-130-10","upc":"759948813011","size":"Short","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"299.00","sale_price":"299.00"}},"categories":["snow","ski-bindings","telemark-ski-bindings"]}
