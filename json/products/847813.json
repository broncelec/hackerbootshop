Antishock springs can be turned on and off with a twist of the pole-use the extra cushion for going downhill or set it rigid for uphill support. Shocklight springs are located inside the inner shaft for quiet and smooth performance. 8 in. foam grip and a wide, padded wrist loop ensure a comfortable and secure hold; cork knob unscrews to create a monopod camera mount. Small-diameter trekking basket helps keep the carbide tip from sinking into soft dirt and sand. 3-section shaft extends to 58 in. and collapses to 29 in.-small enough to strap to a daypack.","short_description":"The telescoping, lightweight REI Hiker Shocklight staff features internal springs to absorb shock and help protect your joints while you wander.","category":"Camping & Hiking","subcategory":"Hiking Staffs And Trekking Poles","product_group":"Walking Staffs","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s284979.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l284979.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=284979&tt=df","keywords":"Walking,pole,Staff,COLLAPSIBLE,hiking","retail_price":"69.50","sale_price":"69.50","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=284979\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m284979.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=847813&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8478130001":{"sku":"8478130001","vendor_sku":"176 24 250-10","upc":"484781300014","color":"MINERAL WATER","retail_price":"69.50","sale_price":"69.50"}}}
