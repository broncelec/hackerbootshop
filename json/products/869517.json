Polarized gray lenses are ideal for extremely bright sunlight; SportFlex rose-tinted lenses have a blue mirror coating suitable for cloudy, overcast days and dusk and dawn. Polarized lenses reduce 99% of visible glare from water, snow, sand and pavement for increased visual acuity and decreased eye strain. Polarized Crystal Carbonate(R) (P.C.C.) lenses have the strongest hard coating available to protect against scratching. P.C.C. lenses pass the rigorous ANSI Z80.3 tests for optical clarity and impact resistance and block 100% of harmful UVA and UVB light. Tough thermoplastic frames endure extreme highs and lows in temperature. Venting system incorporated into the frames enhances airflow and virtually eliminates fog and condensation.

Anti-Ocular Intrusion System(R), a 4-point configuration, helps prevent lenses from shooting into your face in the event of high-velocity impact. Cam-action spring hinges quickly lock temples in position. The Native Apres polarized sunglasses are sized to best fit medium-large profiles.
