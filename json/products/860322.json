{"sku":"860322","manufacturer_id":"113302.17","brand_name":"Volkl","product_name":"Volkl Nanuq Telemark / Randonee Skis - 2013/2014","long_description":"The Volkl Nanuq telemark/randonee skis feature a shape of 131/96/114 and rockered tips for a forgiving ride no matter what the snow conditions are. Construction features a multilayer core of poplar and beech wood that is wrapped in composite and fiberglass near the middle of the ski to add strength and snap. Vertical sidewalls combine with the wrapped core to provide excellent grip and stability while skiing hard and fast. Tip rocker combines early-rise tips with classic camber in the rest of the skis to provide easy, smooth turn initiation; tip rocker is forgiving and floats well in soft snow. Holes in the front of the skis function as skin attachment points for Volkl-brand skins (not included). Non-Volkl-brand skins (sold separately) can also be used with the Nunataq skis. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.","short_description":"The Volkl Nanuq telemark/randonee skis feature a shape of 131/96/114 and rockered tips for a forgiving ride no matter what the snow conditions are.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Backcountry Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s381819.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l381819.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=381819&tt=df","retail_price":"699.00","sale_price":"558.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=381819\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m381819.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=860322&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8603220001":{"sku":"8603220001","vendor_sku":"113302.17","upc":"821264527528","size":"170 CM","retail_price":"558.93","sale_price":"558.93"},"8603220002":{"sku":"8603220002","vendor_sku":"113302.177","upc":"821264527535","size":"177 CM","retail_price":"558.93","sale_price":"558.93"}},"categories":["snow","skis","backcountry-skis"]}
