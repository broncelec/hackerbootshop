{"sku":"867100","manufacturer_id":"32012","brand_name":"Superfeet","product_name":"Superfeet Carbon Insoles - Low Volume","long_description":"The low-volume Superfeet Carbon Insoles have a breakthrough design that combines the strength of carbon fiber with ultralight foam to support your feet when you're running, hiking and playing sports. Insoles achieve a new level of lightweight performance by combining a carbon fiber-reinforced stabilizer cap with a durable, ultralight foam layer. Carbon insoles fit best in a wide range of tight-fitting, low-volume athletic footwear with removable insoles, such as cleats and lightweight running shoes. The structured heel cups help stabilize and support the feet and position the heels to naturally absorb impact and reduce stress on the feet, ankles and knees. Perforations under the midfoot and forefoot reduce weight and improve breathability. Superfeet Carbon Insoles have an all-natural antimicrobial coating that inhibits the growth of odor-causing bacteria.","short_description":"The low-volume Superfeet Carbon Insoles have a breakthrough design that combines the strength of carbon fiber with ultralight foam to support your feet when you're running, hiking and playing sports.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Footwear Accessories","product_group":"Insoles","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s376703.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l376703.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=376703&tt=df","keywords":"shoe inserts","retail_price":"50.00","sale_price":"50.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=376703\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m376703.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=867100&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8671000002":{"sku":"8671000002","vendor_sku":"32008","upc":"086301320085","size":"D (7.5-9)","retail_price":"50.00","sale_price":"50.00"},"8671000003":{"sku":"8671000003","vendor_sku":"32010","upc":"086301320108","size":"E (9.5-11)","retail_price":"50.00","sale_price":"50.00"}},"categories":["footwear","footwear-accessories","insoles"]}
