{"sku":"851554","manufacturer_id":"760XL","brand_name":"Thule","product_name":" Thule AeroBlade Edge Roof Bar - Flush Mount","long_description":"Made specifically to accommodate vehicles with recessed rain gutters or flush factory rails, the Thule AeroBlade Edge Flush Mount roof bar is shaped to reduce noise and drag for quiet travels. Aluminum bar features a textured cover that diffuses airflow better than a smooth surface, greatly reducing wind noise. The SmartSlide(TM) system is a tape-measure-free, hassle-free molded measurement system on the underside of the bar for easy foot installation. Using a vertical load test, the AeroBlade Edge flush mount bar can sustain over 800 lbs. of force. The Thule AeroBlade Edge Flush Mount roof bar includes one bar with integrated feet preassembled; please note, does not include locks. These load bars are available in three different sizes, so be sure to refer to the Thule Fit Guide for the minimum size recommended for your specific vehicle.","short_description":"Made specifically to accommodate vehicles with recessed rain gutters or flush factory rails, the Thule AeroBlade Edge Flush Mount roof bar is shaped to reduce noise and drag for quiet travels.","category":"Car Racks","subcategory":"Base Roof Racks","product_group":"Roof Rack Cross Bars","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s408071.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l408071.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=408071&tt=df","retail_price":"179.95","sale_price":"179.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=408071\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m408071.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=851554&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8515540001":{"sku":"8515540001","vendor_sku":"7601","upc":"091021256200","size":"S","retail_price":"179.95","sale_price":"179.95"},"8515540003":{"sku":"8515540003","vendor_sku":"7603","upc":"091021102422","size":"L","retail_price":"179.95","sale_price":"179.95"}},"categories":["car-racks","base-roof-racks","roof-rack-cross-bars"]}
