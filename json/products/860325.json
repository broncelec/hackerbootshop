{"sku":"860325","manufacturer_id":"113372.161","brand_name":"Volkl","product_name":" Volkl Yumi Skis - Women's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Built with easy-to-turn rockered tips and a versatile 83mm waist to handle bumps, trees, freshies or hardpack, the Volkl Yumi women's skis tackle any terrain on the mountain. Wide enough to float and narrow enough to remain nimble, the versatile 83mm waists give the Yumi skis excellent stability in any terrain. Slight rise in the tips makes it easy to start turning and offers forgiving stability in crud, and standard camber underfoot enhances maneuverability on groomed runs. Wood core uses lightweight and structurally sound balsa wood, creating a core that's lighter and more flexible than comparable unisex skis. With a vertically laminated core and vertical sidewalls, the Yumi skis turn easily from edge to edge and are responsive to aggressive turns at high speed. Tough Box construction sheathes the wood core in composite and fiberglass to remain durable during high speed landings and to snap back quickly from aggressive turns. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.","short_description":"Built with easy-to-turn rockered tips and a versatile 83mm waist to handle bumps, trees, freshies or hardpack, the Volkl Yumi women's skis tackle any terrain on the mountain.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s444187.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l444187.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=444187&tt=df","retail_price":"549.00","sale_price":"399.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=444187\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m444187.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=860325&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8603250002":{"sku":"8603250002","vendor_sku":"113372.161","upc":"821264529935","size":"161 CM","retail_price":"399.83","sale_price":"399.83"}}}
