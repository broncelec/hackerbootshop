{"sku":"858671","manufacturer_id":"302501","brand_name":"Dalbello","product_name":"Dalbello Panterra 90 Ski Boots - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"A medium flexing boot for intermediate skiers on rockered skis, the Dalbello Panterra 90 ski boots enhance comfort with adjustable footbed widths and ski/hike switches to make walking easy. Toe buckles adjust width of footbeds from a snug 100mm performance-oriented fit to a spacious 102mm comfort-oriented fit. Very lightweight ski/hike mechanisms extend the range of motion for the upper cuffs when hiking then lock them down for solid, sensitive and powerful control while skiing. Designed with rockered skis in mind, the Panterra 90 ski boots creat an upright, neutral and centered stance that improves balance on modern ski shapes. Boot mold enhances power, precision and comfort by matching 4 critical fit points: the heels, ankles, 5th metatarsals near your toes and the naviculars near insteps. 3-piece shell design combines separate cuff, shell and tongue sections to create a smooth forward flex with precise side-to-side support. Lightweight, custom-formable liners feature soft, warm foam, insulated forefeet and performance insoles. Liners are engineered to fit correctly right out of the box, but they can be custom formed as well, a procedure best performed in an REI specialty ski shop. Medium flex index of 90 provides the responsive power transfer suited to progressing intermediate skiers.","short_description":"A medium flexing boot for intermediate skiers on rockered skis, the Dalbello Panterra 90 ski boots enhance comfort with adjustable footbed widths and ski/hike switches to make walking easy.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Downhill Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382515.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382515.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382515&tt=df","retail_price":"379.95","sale_price":"379.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382515\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382515.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=858671&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8586710001":{"sku":"8586710001","vendor_sku":"302501","upc":"616438314727","size":"Mondo 26.5","color":"ANTHRACITE/ANTHRACITE","retail_price":"379.95","sale_price":"379.95"},"8586710003":{"sku":"8586710003","vendor_sku":"302501","upc":"616438314765","size":"Mondo 28.5","color":"ANTHRACITE/ANTHRACITE","retail_price":"379.95","sale_price":"379.95"},"8586710004":{"sku":"8586710004","vendor_sku":"302501","upc":"616438314789","size":"Mondo 29.5","color":"ANTHRACITE/ANTHRACITE","retail_price":"379.95","sale_price":"379.95"}},"categories":["snow","ski-boots","downhill-ski-boots"]}
