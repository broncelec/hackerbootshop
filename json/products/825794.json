{"sku":"825794","manufacturer_id":"10010026","brand_name":"Novara","product_name":"Novara Zipper Balance Bike - Girls'","long_description":"Our new Novara Zipper girls' balance bike is the walk-and-roll learning toy for kids who are eager to learn how to balance and ride a bike! Without pedals or training wheels, a child starts by walking the Zipper along slowly, then rolling along and learning how to balance. As kids develop their handling skills and balance, they can coast farther with their feet off the ground. Braking is simple: kids just put their feet down on the ground and slow themselves with their feet. Frame is constructed out of sturdy steel to ensure frequent and enduring use (and fun times). Ships completely assembled-all you have to do when you receive it is straighten the bars and set the saddle height; hex wrench and instructions are included. Our Novara Zipper balance bike has a recommended maximum rider weight of 60 lbs. Please note: the Zipper has a minimum standover height of 17.25 in., which means that the child's inseam must be a minimum of 17.25 in. long.","short_description":"Our new Novara Zipper girls' balance bike is the walk-and-roll learning toy for kids who are eager to learn how to balance and ride a bike!","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bikes","product_group":"Kids' Bikes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s376323.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l376323.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=376323&tt=df","retail_price":"99.50","sale_price":"99.50","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=376323\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m376323.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=825794&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8257940001":{"sku":"8257940001","vendor_sku":"10010026","upc":"482579400014","color":"PINK","retail_price":"99.50","sale_price":"99.50"}},"categories":["cycling","bikes","kids-bikes"]}
