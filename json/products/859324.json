{"sku":"859324","manufacturer_id":"S130302901177","brand_name":"K2","product_name":" K2 Annex 108 Skis - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"The K2 Annex 108 skis use a metal laminate and rockered tips to amp up your sidecountry explorations, from blazingly fast lines in fresh powder to wind-blown crust and sun-baked bowls. Dual titanal laminate offers unwavering stability at high speeds by absorbing bumps and responding quickly to high-speed maneuvers. Rockered tips initiate turns easily and offer agile performance on all kinds of terrain, and slight camber underfoot offers tenacious edge hold on firm snow. Lightweight aspen, paulownia and maple wood core produces a natural flex, allowing the ski to achieve full contact with the snow throughout the turn. The widest point of the tips is placed further back than on other K2 skis to reduce the tendency of skis to hook in light crust and throw you off balance. Slightly raised tails release easily during turns to reduce speed and avoid obstacles, and they make it easier to turn quickly when skiing concave-shaped couloirs and chutes. Use tip and tail holes to attach skins (sold separately); remove plugs with a flathead screwdriver. 108mm waist requires bindings with wide brakes. Base or topsheet color of the K2 Annex 108 skis may vary from online photo.","short_description":"The K2 Annex 108 skis use a metal laminate and rockered tips to amp up your sidecountry explorations, from blazingly fast lines in fresh powder to wind-blown crust and sun-baked bowls.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s442431.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l442431.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=442431&tt=df","retail_price":"699.95","sale_price":"589.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=442431\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m442431.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859324&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8593240001":{"sku":"8593240001","vendor_sku":"S130302901170","upc":"886745164111","size":"170 CM","retail_price":"589.93","sale_price":"589.93"},"8593240002":{"sku":"8593240002","vendor_sku":"S130302901177","upc":"886745164135","size":"177 CM","retail_price":"589.93","sale_price":"589.93"},"8593240003":{"sku":"8593240003","vendor_sku":"S130302901184","upc":"886745164159","size":"184 CM","retail_price":"589.93","sale_price":"589.93"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
