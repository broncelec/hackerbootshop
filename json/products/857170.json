{"sku":"857170","manufacturer_id":"1330413","brand_name":"Union","product_name":"Union Atlas Snowboard Bindings - 2013/2014","long_description":"Delivering a lightweight yet responsive feel for all-mountain riding, the Union Atlas snowboard bindings feature flexible highbacks that let you flex forward or lean back easily for amazing control. Bases are made with high-quality DuPont(TM) Zytel(R) ST nylon; they're strong, supportive and secure, and offer balanced comfort and response. Baseplates are designed to be supremely strong with the smallest footprint possible; this promotes free, even board flex for sweeter response, board control and durability. Extruded aluminum heel cups reduce weight and maintain strength; dual-density EVA bushings offering vibration damping that allows you to feel the natural board flex. Multizone highbacks offer three different zones of flex for a transitional top-to-bottom flex, with the top third being the softest and the bottom third the stiffest. 3D Direct-Connect ankle straps eliminate elasticity and evenly distribute pressure across feet and ankles for increased comfort and board control. Multi-position toe straps offer an improved and updated fit for a wide range of boots. Magnesium buckles are 4 times stronger than aluminum with only half the weight. Union Atlas bindings are compatible with Burton The Channel M6 snowboards.","short_description":"Delivering a lightweight yet responsive feel for all-mountain riding, the Union Atlas snowboard bindings feature flexible highbacks that let you flex forward or lean back easily for amazing control.","category":"Snowboarding","subcategory":"Snowboard Bindings","product_group":"Strap Snowboard Bindings","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382975.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382975.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382975&tt=df","retail_price":"239.95","sale_price":"178.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382975\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382975.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=857170&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8571700001":{"sku":"8571700001","vendor_sku":"1330433","upc":"842852134997","size":"M/L","color":"HAZARD ORANGE","retail_price":"153.83","sale_price":"153.83"},"8571700002":{"sku":"8571700002","vendor_sku":"1330435","upc":"842852135000","size":"L/XL","color":"HAZARD ORANGE","retail_price":"153.83","sale_price":"153.83"},"8571700004":{"sku":"8571700004","vendor_sku":"1330415","upc":"842852134942","size":"L/XL","color":"BLACK/WHITE","retail_price":"178.83","sale_price":"178.83"}},"categories":["snow","snowboard-bindings","strap-snowboard-bindings"]}
