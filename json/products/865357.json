And, you can wear it like a jacket to read, cook and walk around. Jacket hood moves with you when your roll around and turn your head; there are no cords or toggles to bug you. Zipperless arm ports are ready for instant use-simply stick your arms out to grab a book or hold a mug of hot chocolate. 58 in. long zipper runs down the center of the top of the bag and allows easy entry and exit; 2-way zipper lets you zip open the bottom for venting. Unzip the bottom, stick your feet and go for a walk while wearing the sleeping bag; tuck the footbox up with toggles to prevent bag from dragging on the ground when you walk. Hood, zipper and arm ports all have reinforced draft tubes to prevent cold air from sneaking in. When you're sitting upright in the sleeping bag, the shoulder design fits comfortably like a jacket. Down is considered the best insulation available, but when wet it quickly loses loft and the ability to keep you warm; 800-fill-power DriDown is treated to resist moisture. Proprietary process treats each individual duck down plume with a molecular-level polymer so the down stays dry longer, lofts better and dries faster than untreated down. DriDown insulation stays dry 10 times longer, retains 170% more loft when exposed to moisture and dries 33% faster than untreated down. Ripstop polyester exterior endures frequent use in the outdoors; polyester taffeta lining is soft and comfortable next to skin. Sierra Designs Sierra Designs Mobile Mummy 800 2-Season Sleeping Bag comes with a stuff sack and storage sack.","short_description":"The Sierra Designs Mobile Mummy 800 2-Season Sleeping Bag is designed to move with you so you can sleep on your side, stomach or back.
