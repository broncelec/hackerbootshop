{"sku":"857956","manufacturer_id":"43607","brand_name":"Jones","product_name":" Jones Aviator Snowboard - 2013/2014","long_description":"The all-new Jones Aviator snowboard is made for the daredevil park rider inside of you. Built for going big, this board features 3D beveled up edges for a looser, less-catchy feel in the park. Edges are beveled from the contact points of the camber to the ends of the board, releasing the edges where they are most likely to catch. Twin profile and blunt nose keep you floating while the mellow Magne-Traction locks in stability when the fresh tracks are gone; camber profile offers insane edge response. Mellow Magne-Traction improves edge grip by adding five contact points along the running length of the board, resulting in amazing control whether riding ice or pow. Full wood core is comfortable and robust; it's a true all-terrain core and certified by the Forest Stewardship Council; fiberglass enhances the flex and board feel. Carbon stringers improve pop and torsional stiffness, and increase the longevity of the flex profile. Film topsheet saves weight over traditional plastic topsheets; sintered base absorbs and retains wax; steel edges. P-tex waste is drastically reduced by flip-flopping base graphic colors between boards; base colors are random, thus specific requests cannot be accommodated. .","short_description":"The all-new Jones Aviator snowboard is made for the daredevil park rider inside of you.
