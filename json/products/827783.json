{"sku":"827783","manufacturer_id":"13632","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":"REI Quarter Dome T1 Tent","long_description":"The REI Quarter Dome T1 semi-freestanding tent uses lightweight materials and a unique pole design to create a 1-person, 3-season backpacking tent that's roomy, well ventilated and strong. One side-entry door and a large Dry Entry vestibule offer convenient access and ample storage capacity. REI-exclusive Tension Truss design enhances structural stability, prevents deformation in the wind and maximizes room around your head and shoulders. Semi-freestanding tripod design requires less material to keep overall weight low; staking the tent out maximizes interior space. Aluminum DAC Featherlight NSL hubbed poles are lightweight; set-up is quick and easy with pole clips and color coding. Fully adjustable, high-level vents mitigate condensation, drawing cool air under the fly from the lower perimeter and exhausting warm, moist air. Bathtub floor with seam-sealed corners ensures waterproof protection. Windproof, breathable perimeter fabric blocks dust and sand from blowing in under the fly. Silicone-treated, lightweight ripstop nylon fly stays taut in the rain, avoiding moisture-transfer to the tent while keeping you dry. No-Wick welded construction ensures that moisture won't wick through susceptible areas such as guyout points, pole wraps or zippers in wet conditions. REI Quarterdome 1 tent offers multiple interior mesh side pockets and hang loops for organization. Tent door stuffs in its own stash pocket for out-of-the-way convenience. Includes tapered, easy-to-stuff compression stuff sack, 5 stakes, 2 guylines and tighteners, pole repair tube, pole and stake bags.","short_description":"The REI Quarter Dome T1 semi-freestanding tent uses lightweight materials and a unique pole design to create a 1-person, 3-season backpacking tent that's roomy, well ventilated and strong.","category":"Camping & Hiking","subcategory":"Tents","product_group":"Backpacking Tents","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s304075.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l304075.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=304075&tt=df","keywords":"backpacktent,tent","retail_price":"219.00","sale_price":"163.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=304075\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m304075.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=827783&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8277830001":{"sku":"8277830001","vendor_sku":"13632","upc":"482778300016","color":"LICHEN/PLATINUM","retail_price":"163.93","sale_price":"163.93"}}}
