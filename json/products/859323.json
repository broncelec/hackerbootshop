{"sku":"859323","manufacturer_id":"S130303001184","brand_name":"K2","product_name":" K2 Annex 98 Skis - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Whether you're skiing routine hardpack, sunbaked crud or the sweet untracked pow after a big storm, the K2 Annex 98 skis use a metal laminate and rockered tips so you can shred at high speed. Dual titanal laminate offers unwavering stability at high speeds by absorbing bumps and responding quickly to high-speed maneuvers. Rockered tips initiate turns easily and offer agile performance on all kinds of terrain, and slight camber underfoot offers tenacious edge hold on firm snow. Lightweight aspen, paulownia and maple wood core produces a natural flex, allowing the ski to achieve full contact with the snow throughout the turn. The widest point of the tips is placed further back than on other K2 skis to reduce the tendency of skis to hook in light crust and throw you off balance. Slightly raised tails release easily during turns to reduce speed and avoid obstacles, and they make it easier to turn quickly when skiing concave-shaped couloirs and chutes. Use tip and tail holes to attach skins (sold separately); remove plugs with a flathead screwdriver. 98mm waist requires bindings with wide brakes. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.","short_description":"Whether you're skiing routine hardpack, sunbaked crud or the sweet untracked pow after a big storm, the K2 Annex 98 skis use a metal laminate and rockered tips so you can shred at high speed.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382031.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382031.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382031&tt=df","retail_price":"699.95","sale_price":"419.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382031\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382031.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859323&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8593230001":{"sku":"8593230001","vendor_sku":"S130303001170","upc":"886745164197","size":"170 CM","retail_price":"419.93","sale_price":"419.93"},"8593230002":{"sku":"8593230002","vendor_sku":"S130303001177","upc":"886745164210","size":"177 CM","retail_price":"419.93","sale_price":"419.93"},"8593230003":{"sku":"8593230003","vendor_sku":"S130303001184","upc":"886745164234","size":"184 CM","retail_price":"419.93","sale_price":"419.93"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
