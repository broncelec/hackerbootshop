{"sku":"815662","manufacturer_id":"83380","brand_name":"Patagonia","product_name":"Patagonia Piolet Rain Jacket - Men's","long_description":"Spend a day in the mountain playground-snowshoe up, snowboard down, hit the ice park and then the hot springs. The men's Patagonia Piolet protects for everything except the end-of-day soak! 2-layer nylon Gore-Tex(R) Performance Shell fabric provides year-round waterproof, breathable protection and total versatility in the mountains. Hanging lining breathes and wicks moisture away from body for warm, dry comfort. Helmet-compatible, 2-way adjustable hood has a laminated visor to keep sun rays and snowflakes out of your eyes. Front zipper features double storm flaps with rip-and-stick closures; wicking collar lining is soft and warm next to skin. Super low-bulk pit zips allow fast venting; watertight, coated zippers reduce zipper bulk and weight. Cuffs have low-profile closure with pleated gusset. Embedded cordlocks in the hood and hem allow quick adjustment without opening the jacket. 1 chest and 2 handwarmer pockets have watertight zippers; pockets are positioned to be compatible with harnesses and pack straps. Patagonia Piolet also has 1 internal zip security pocket. Includes full-reach gusseted underarm panels for mobility. Regular fit allows airflow and evaporative cooling, and eases layering.","short_description":"Spend a day in the mountain playground-snowshoe up, snowboard down, hit the ice park and then the hot springs.
