{"sku":"849387","manufacturer_id":"32660014","brand_name":"Mavic","product_name":" Mavic Crossmax SLR 29er Disc Wheelset","long_description":"Lithe and lightning fast, the Mavic Crossmax SLR 29er Disc mountain bike wheelset is built to meet the demands of cross-country racing. Proprietary lighweight aluminum rims have a drilling method that doesn't penetrate the tube-facing wall, enhancing wheel strength and rigidity. This drilling method also allows UST tubeless compatibility, offering all the benefits of tubeless with the option of using a traditional tube/tire setup. Inter Spoke Milling 3D dramatically reduces material between spokes and along sides of rims, reducing weight and making them well-suited to climbing and fast acceleration. Rim joints are welded and milled to maximize strength, rigidity and wheel balance while also offering a smooth finish. Rear hub uses Instant Transfer System 4 freewheel design to supply fast engagement via 4 pawls, ensuring your energy is transferred to the wheel quickly and efficiently. Double-sealed cartridge bearings deliver excellent longevity and smooth spinning; microadjustability lets you fine-tune bearing loads to optimize your ride. Both wheels use 20 lightweight, straight-pull and bladed Zicral alloy spokes; front is laced 2-cross while rear uses radial lacing on drive-side and 2-cross on non-drive-side. Front hub is compatible with either 15mm thru-axle or traditional 9mm quick-release; rear hub is compatible with 9mm or 12mm axles, 135mm or 142mm axle widths. Mavic Crossmax SLR 29er Disc wheelset is compatible with standard 6-bolt disc brake rotors. Comes with wheel bags, quick-release (QR) skewers, front and rear QR adapters, rear 12x142mm adapters, removable UST valves/accessories, magnet, adjustment tool and disc bolts. Mavic recommended maximum combined weight of the cyclist, bike and equipment is 220 lbs. (100kg); recommended tire width is 1.5 - 2.3 in.","short_description":"Lithe and lightning fast, the Mavic Crossmax SLR 29er Disc mountain bike wheelset is built to meet the demands of cross-country racing.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Components","product_group":"Bike Tires, Tubes And Wheels","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s389559.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l389559.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=389559&tt=df","retail_price":"990.95","sale_price":"990.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=389559\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m389559.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=849387&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8493870001":{"sku":"8493870001","vendor_sku":"32660014","upc":"080694489107","size":"29 IN","retail_price":"990.95","sale_price":"990.95"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-components","bike-tires-tubes-and-wheels"]}
