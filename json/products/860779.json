{"sku":"860779","manufacturer_id":"AA0024880165","brand_name":"Atomic","product_name":"Atomic Panic Skis - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"With rockered tips for tricks and a versatile 87mm waist, the Atomic Panic skis blur the line between freestyle and all-mountain skis to take on any terrain and really let it rip in the park. At 87mm in the waist, this chubby ski floats atop deep snow yet won't leave you lagging behind while chasing friends through fast turns. Wood core provides smooth handling at high speeds and in deep powder snow. Half-cap construction in tips and tails improves durability. A rockered profile designed to tame the terrain park features elevated tips and tails with camber underfoot for sliding rails and spinning in the air. Double-layer sidewalls in binding area enhance edge grip by absorbing shock. Directional twin tip heavily favors skiing forward but allows you to ski and land jumps backward if needed. Atomic Panic skis sport a graphite base that tunes beautifully and accepts wax readily. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.","short_description":"With rockered tips for tricks and a versatile 87mm waist, the Atomic Panic skis blur the line between freestyle and all-mountain skis to take on any terrain and really let it rip in the park.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382291.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382291.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382291&tt=df","retail_price":"399.00","sale_price":"319.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382291\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382291.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=860779&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8607790001":{"sku":"8607790001","vendor_sku":"AA0024880157","upc":"884397742763","size":"157 CM","retail_price":"319.93","sale_price":"319.93"},"8607790002":{"sku":"8607790002","vendor_sku":"AA0024880165","upc":"884397742770","size":"165 CM","retail_price":"319.93","sale_price":"319.93"},"8607790003":{"sku":"8607790003","vendor_sku":"AA0024880173","upc":"884397742787","size":"173 CM","retail_price":"319.93","sale_price":"319.93"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
