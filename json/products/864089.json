{"sku":"864089","manufacturer_id":"22450-4433","brand_name":"Marmot","product_name":" Marmot Hydrogen Sleeping Bag","long_description":"Weighing less than 2 lbs. and filled with quality 850-fill, water-resistant goose down, the Marmot Hydrogen Sleeping Bag delivers warmth for ultralight, cool-weather climbs and backcountry excursions. With a European Norm (EN) lower-limit rating of 29degF, the Hydrogen sleeping bag is suitable for 3-season use. Lofty, premium 850-fill-power goose down offers superb warmth for minimal weight; it's meticulously cleaned and processed for hypoallergenic qualities. Down is treated to resist moisture to maintain warmth; treated down stays drier 10 times longer, maintains 150% more loft and dries 30% faster than untreated down. Nautilus 3D 6-baffle hood envelops your head in warmth; down gasket face muff allows hood to be cinched snug without digging into your face. Down-filled draft tube backing the snag-free zipper seals out cold air. Ground-level side seams eliminate cold air leaks and allow the goose down insulation to loft fully. Trapezoidal footbox is wider in the toe area and narrower in the heels to match the shape of your feet. Stretch tricot baffles allow the bag to be stuffed and unstuffed without tearing the baffle material. Lightweight Pertex(R) Microlight fabric stands up to abrasion and won't let the down escape. Zipper guards prevent zipper snags; locking zippers keep bag from opening if you toss and turn at night. Marmot Hydrogen Sleeping Bag comes with a stuff sack and a storage bag. European Norm (EN) is an independent third-party temperature rating, allowing accurate comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags.","short_description":"Weighing less than 2 lbs. and filled with quality 850-fill, water-resistant goose down, the Marmot Hydrogen Sleeping Bag delivers warmth for ultralight, cool-weather climbs and backcountry excursions.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags And Accessories","product_group":"Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s421595.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l421595.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=421595&tt=df","keywords":"compact","retail_price":"369.00","sale_price":"369.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=421595\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m421595.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=864089&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8640890001":{"sku":"8640890001","vendor_sku":"22440-4433","upc":"785562425156","size":"Regular Left","color":"GREEN LICHEN/GREEN LIME","retail_price":"349.00","sale_price":"349.00"},"8640890002":{"sku":"8640890002","vendor_sku":"22450-4433","upc":"785562500723","size":"Long Left","color":"GREEN LICHEN/GREEN LIME","retail_price":"369.00","sale_price":"369.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sleeping-bags-and-accessories","sleeping-bags"]}
