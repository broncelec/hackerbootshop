{"sku":"767290","manufacturer_id":"MAST006","brand_name":"Metolius","product_name":" Metolius Master Cams","long_description":"Whether climbing aid or free, you're sure to find the placement you need with the new Metolius Master Cams. Single-stem design allows cams to fit into tight spots; flexible cable reduces walking and enables placement in horizontal cracks. Long body provides excellent reach when top-stepping in aiders and stretching for hard-to-reach placements. Narrow head enables secure placements in pin scars and small, uneven cracks. Ergonomic thumb piece creates excellent control while placing and removing cams. Range Finder markings eliminate guess work: Green Zone for go, Yellow Zone for caution and Red Zone for stop!; Range Finder markings only apply to sizes #2 - #6. Lightweight Dyneema nylon slings are color-coded for quick, easy identification. Hand-built and tested by Metolius in Bend, Oregon.","short_description":"Whether climbing aid or free, you're sure to find the placement you need with the new Metolius Master Cams.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Protection","product_group":"Cams","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s407115.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l407115.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=407115&tt=df","retail_price":"59.95","sale_price":"59.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=407115\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m407115.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=767290&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7672900011":{"sku":"7672900011","vendor_sku":"MASS000","upc":"602150434034","size":"Grey","color":"Size 00","retail_price":"59.95","sale_price":"59.95"},"7672900029":{"sku":"7672900029","vendor_sku":"MAST000","upc":"602150434041","size":"Purple","color":"Size 0","retail_price":"59.95","sale_price":"59.95"},"7672900037":{"sku":"7672900037","vendor_sku":"MAST001","upc":"602150434058","size":"Blue","color":"Size 1","retail_price":"59.95","sale_price":"59.95"},"7672900045":{"sku":"7672900045","vendor_sku":"MAST002","upc":"602150434065","size":"Yellow","color":"Size 2","retail_price":"59.95","sale_price":"59.95"},"7672900052":{"sku":"7672900052","vendor_sku":"MAST003","upc":"602150434072","size":"Orange","color":"Size 3","retail_price":"59.95","sale_price":"59.95"}},"categories":["climbing","climbing-protection","cams"]}
