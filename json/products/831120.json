Includes HoodWire 'biners on top and bottom that are linked by a 14mm-wide Dynex dogbone runner, creating a strong and very light quickdraw. Hot-forged HoodWire 'biners have stainless-steel wire hoods that keep the 'biners from snagging on slings, protection and bolt hangers.

The Black Diamond HoodWire quickdraw has a 12cm-long dogbone runner.","short_description":"Weighing in at only 82g and featuring 2 snag-free 'biners, the Black Diamond HoodWire quickdraw set won't slow you down on challenging sport climbs.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Hardware","product_group":"Quickdraws","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s380203.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l380203.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=380203&tt=df","retail_price":"19.95","sale_price":"19.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=380203\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m380203.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=831120&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8311200001":{"sku":"8311200001","vendor_sku":"381064","upc":"793661157977","size":"12 CM","color":"BD ORANGE","retail_price":"19.95","sale_price":"19.95"}},"categories":["climbing","climbing-hardware","quickdraws"]}
