{"sku":"840741","manufacturer_id":"325651","brand_name":"Salomon","product_name":"Salomon Guardian WTR 16L Randonee Bindings","long_description":"The Salomon Guardian WTR 16L randonee bindings provide the power, precision and on-snow feel of a high-performance freeride alpine binding, with the benefit of being able to tour in the backcountry. Switching from hike to ski mode shouldn't be a hassle, and it isn't with the Guardian bindings-simply flick the switches with your ski poles to change modes. Hard-charging skiers who like to hit jumps and cruise at high speeds will appreciate the adjustable DIN that ranges from 7 - 16. Bindings have a low overall stand height of 26mm for great stability while skiing. 80mm width transmits power from you boots to your wide skis for great downhill performance. Bindings include 115mm-wide brakes to fit your wide powder skis; brakes come off with a single turn of a screw driver if you need to remove them. Toe-piece height can be adjusted to fit your boots. Flip the climbing bars up with your ski poles to take some stress off your legs when you're skinning uphill. Salomon Guardian WTR 16L randonee bindings fit boot sizes Mondo 26.5 and larger; bindings are only compatible with boots with alpine DIN soles and WTR soles.","short_description":"The Salomon Guardian WTR 16L randonee bindings provide the power, precision and on-snow feel of a high-performance freeride alpine binding, with the benefit of being able to tour in the backcountry.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Bindings","product_group":"Randonee Ski Bindings","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s381667.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l381667.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=381667&tt=df","retail_price":"449.95","sale_price":"449.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=381667\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m381667.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=840741&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8407410001":{"sku":"8407410001","vendor_sku":"325651","upc":"080694104031","size":"L","retail_price":"449.95","sale_price":"449.95"}},"categories":["snow","ski-bindings","randonee-ski-bindings"]}
