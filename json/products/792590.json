{"sku":"792590","manufacturer_id":"400038","brand_name":"Black Diamond","product_name":" Black Diamond Sabretooth Pro Step-In Crampons with ABS Plates","long_description":"The all-around Black Diamond Sabretooth Pro Step-In crampons are suitable for everything from glacier climbing to swinging tools on alpine ice. Now constructed using stainless steel for a design that won't rust, crampons are lighter weight and more durable than previous version; stainless steel resists snow balling. Horizontal front points provide excellent stability on snow, alpine ice and rock. Secondary points create a stable platform while kicking steps; serrated points bite into snow and ice for secure hold. Redesigned, low-profile heel lever lets you microadjust the fit. Included dual-density ABS plates keep snow from sticking beneath your feet. Pro step-in crampons require boots with front and rear welts designed specifically for step-in style attachment. Boots size 12 and larger require the Long Center Bars, sold separately.","short_description":"The all-around Black Diamond Sabretooth Pro Step-In crampons are suitable for everything from glacier climbing to swinging tools on alpine ice.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Mountaineering Gear","product_group":"Crampons","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s407487.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l407487.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=407487&tt=df","retail_price":"179.95","sale_price":"179.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=407487\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m407487.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=792590&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7925900016":{"sku":"7925900016","vendor_sku":"400038","upc":"793661118992","size":"ONE SIZE","retail_price":"179.95","sale_price":"179.95"}},"categories":["climbing","mountaineering-gear","crampons"]}
