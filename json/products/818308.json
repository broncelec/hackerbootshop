{"sku":"818308","manufacturer_id":"222-2M","brand_name":"Maui Jim","product_name":" Maui Jim Longboard Polarized Sunglasses - Men's","long_description":"Maui Jim Longboard polarized sunglasses are mid-sized wrap-arounds that provide protection from the sun whether you're relaxing on the beach or fishing for the big one. Polarized lenses reduce 99% of visible glare from water, snow, sand and pavement for increased visual acuity and decreased eye strain. Maui Jim PolarizedPlus2 lenses block glare and UV from all angles while managing harmful blue light and boosting colors for clarity and contrast. Fusing the best qualities of glass and polycarbonate, Maui Evolution(R) lenses offer superior optics and scratch- and impact-resistance, all in a lightweight package. Lenses feature a scratch-resistant treatment on the front and back for added durability. Lens coating sheds sweat, water and repels skin oils, preventing build-up and keeping your vision clear. Grilamid(R) TR90 lightweight nylon frames offer a consistent fit and flexibility in all temperatures and are extremely impact resistant. Frames feature bronze lenses and offer excellent contrast; perfect for low-light and for people who like a subtle bronze hue for everyday wear. Anti-corrosive nickel/silver alloy spring hinges enhance durability. Built-in rubber nose pads prevent slippage. Maui Jim Longboard polarized sunglasses include a protective case and cleaning cloth.","short_description":"Maui Jim Longboard polarized sunglasses are mid-sized wrap-arounds that provide protection from the sun whether you're relaxing on the beach or fishing for the big one.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sunglasses","product_group":"Casual Sunglasses","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s422351.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l422351.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=422351&tt=df","retail_price":"219.00","sale_price":"219.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=422351\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m422351.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=818308&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8183080001":{"sku":"8183080001","vendor_sku":"H222-26","upc":"603429016289","size":"Bronze","color":"Rootbeer","retail_price":"219.00","sale_price":"219.00"},"8183080002":{"sku":"8183080002","vendor_sku":"222-2M","upc":"603429016265","size":"NEUTRAL GREY","color":"MATTE BLACK RUBBER","retail_price":"219.00","sale_price":"219.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sunglasses","casual-sunglasses"]}
