{"sku":"864554","manufacturer_id":"A1R2P6M","brand_name":"The North Face","product_name":" The North Face Tephora Sleeping Bag - Women's","long_description":"Built for women, the down-insulated The North Face Tephora Sleeping Bag has a roomier cut than standard backpacking bags, giving you more room to relax on your spring, summer and fall adventures. With a European Norm (EN) comfort rating of 24degF, the Tephora is a versatile bag for 3-season backpacking adventures. 550-fill-power ProDown(TM) natural goose down insulation is light and lofty. ProDown(TM) is enhanced with a hydrophobic finish that improves warmth by allowing it to dry faster and repel moisture up to 10 times longer than untreated down. Anti-compression pads made from Heatseeker(TM) Eco synthetic insulation are sewn into high-pressure areas that contact the ground to create an insulating buffer. Shaped hood and down-insulated draft collar hold in warmth. Insulated draft tube backs the zipper to prevent warm air from escaping; antisnag tape keeps the zipper from catching on the draft tube. 3/4-length, 2-way zipper lets you make adjustments for ventilation. Comfort-oriented shape has a less-tapered cut than some backpacking sleeping bags, allowing you more room to move around. Footbox allows natural foot movement while also eliminating excess lateral space so you stay warm and comfortable all night long. The North Face Tephora Sleeping Bag comes with a compression stuff sack and a storage sack. European Norm (EN) is an independent third-party temperature rating, allowing accurate comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags.","short_description":"Built for women, the down-insulated The North Face Tephora Sleeping Bag has a roomier cut than standard backpacking bags, giving you more room to relax on your spring, summer and fall adventures.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags And Accessories","product_group":"Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s421699.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l421699.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=421699&tt=df","keywords":"compact","retail_price":"199.00","sale_price":"199.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=421699\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m421699.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=864554&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8645540001":{"sku":"8645540001","vendor_sku":"A1R2P6M","upc":"766182534329","size":"Regular Right","color":"MARLIN BLUE/ASPHALT GREY","retail_price":"189.00","sale_price":"189.00"},"8645540002":{"sku":"8645540002","vendor_sku":"A1R2P6M","upc":"700051547645","size":"Long Right","color":"MARLIN BLUE/ASPHALT GREY","retail_price":"199.00","sale_price":"199.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sleeping-bags-and-accessories","sleeping-bags"]}
