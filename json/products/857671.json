Adjustable heel cups and cushioned straps and bases make for a comfortable fit, no matter where you ride. Re:Flex minimized, cored baseplates dramatically improve board flex and feel, reduce weight and allow a variety of cushioning options. Women-specific True Fit design means that every element of the product is designed and engineered for the way women ride. 30% short-glass/nylon composite baseplates enhance response and power without sacrificing the mobility that riders demand. FullBED(TM) cushioning covers the entire baseplate, and shock-absorbent damping pads eat up vibrations, sudden impacts and rough terrain so you don't have to. Canted Living Hinge(TM) Zero-Lean highbacks offers a playful, relaxed fit and feel; highbacks can be cranked forward for a more aggressive stance. Superstrap(TM) ankle straps feature precurved spines molded to match the shape of your feet and ankles; gel padding dials in comfort. Primo Capstrap(TM) toe straps lock you in the bindings. Smooth Glide(TM) buckles deliver buttery-smooth and reliable ratcheting power season after season. Burton Scribe bindings are compatible with traditional 3D(TM), 4x4 bolt patterns and The Channel.","short_description":"The women's Burton Scribe snowboard bindings are built to shred everything on the trail map.
