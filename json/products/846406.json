{"sku":"846406","manufacturer_id":"013060-311-3-LG","brand_name":"Osprey","product_name":"Osprey Aether 60 Pack","long_description":"The bestselling Osprey Aether 60 pack just got even better with an updated design and a stiff, well-padded hipbelt. You'll be amazed by its light weight, support, comfort and highly customizable fit. Custom-moldable, anatomically contoured hipbelt balances firmness and cushioning for optimal support and comfort. Osprey certified custom molding is available in most REI stores-check your local store for a custom hipbelt molding oven. Back panel is lined with flat spacer mesh for a smooth and breathable contact surface. Peripheral frame effectively transfers weight to the hipbelt; single 6061-T6 aluminum center stay helps maintain back panel shape. Top-loading main compartment can also be accessed through a curved side zipper on the front of the pack body; wide-mouth sleeping bag compartment is easy to load and unload. Top lid converts to lumbar pack with a built-in belt. External hydration sleeve in the back panel simplifies refilling and helps protect pack contents from spills (hydration reservoir sold separately). Large stretch-mesh front pocket makes it easy to quickly stash and access extra gear. Zippered hipbelt pockets and dual-access stretch-mesh side pockets provide secure storage and organization. The Osprey Aether 60 pack features dual side compression straps, removable sleeping pad straps, trekking pole attachment and 2 ice-axe loops and handle wraps.","short_description":"The bestselling Osprey Aether 60 pack just got even better with an updated design and a stiff, well-padded hipbelt.
