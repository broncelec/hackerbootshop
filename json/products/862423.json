{"sku":"862423","manufacturer_id":"16394","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":" REI Quarter Dome 2 Tent","long_description":"The REI Quarter Dome 2 Tent uses new ultralight materials and a unique pole design to create a lightweight 2-person, 3-season backpacking tent that's roomy, well ventilated and strong. Our new 15-denier ripstop nylon in the tent and fly minimizes weight, yet retains strength; floor uses a lightweight yet robust 30-denier ripstop nylon. REI-exclusive tension-truss architecture creates stable vertical sidewalls and generous headroom while minimizing pole weight. Pole angles and asymmetrical tent shape also enhance living space, allowing both people to sit up. 2 vestibules provide covered storage for each person; doors on fly and tent are aligned for easy entry and exit. Hubbed pole assembly simplifies setup. A large zippered roof vent helps control condensation. Pockets and hang loops help organize the interior. The REI Quarter Dome 2 Tent comes with a stuff sack, stakes, guylines and tighteners, as well as a pole-repair tube, a pole bag and a stake bag. Fly/footprint minimalist pitch option lets you leave the tent at home and use the fly, poles and footprint (sold separately) as a lightweight shelter. The REI Quarter Dome 2 Footprint is sold separately.","short_description":"The REI Quarter Dome 2 Tent uses new ultralight materials and a unique pole design to create a lightweight 2-person, 3-season backpacking tent that's roomy, well ventilated and strong.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Tents","product_group":"Backpacking Tents","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s424007.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l424007.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=424007&tt=df","retail_price":"299.00","sale_price":"299.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=424007\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m424007.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=862423&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8624230001":{"sku":"8624230001","vendor_sku":"16394","upc":"486242300014","color":"ZINC/ORANGE SPICE","retail_price":"299.00","sale_price":"299.00"}}}
