{"sku":"848556","manufacturer_id":"F6277-151","brand_name":"Wigwam","product_name":"Wigwam Merino Trailblaze Pro Socks","long_description":"The Wigwam Trailblaze Pro socks manage moisture with a dri-release(R)/merino wool fabric blend. Medium cushioning and stretch helps keep your feet comfortable mile after mile. dri-release is a blend of natural and man-made fibers that work together to absorb and move moisture away from the skin; it dries more rapidly than other fibers. Wool has resilient shape recovery and it breathes with your body; it also absorbs as much as 30% of its own weight in moisture before feeling damp. Freshguard(R) treatment embedded in the yarn virtually eliminates odor and won't wash out. Stay-put, crew-height Wigwam Merino Trailblaze Pro socks feature breathable mesh panels, fully cushioned bottoms and a measure of stretch so they fit like a soft glove. Durable heels and toes; seamless toe closures ensure comfort for the long haul. *Discount will be applied when you check out. Offer not valid for sale-price items ending in $._3 or $._9.","short_description":"The Wigwam Trailblaze Pro socks manage moisture with a dri-release(R)/merino wool fabric blend.
