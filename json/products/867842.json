Performance-inspired stern and bow result in a longer water line for excellent speed and glide, and shallow-V hull with rounded chine is easy to paddle in varying water types. Adjustable, padded thigh braces and hip pads, and a Phase 3(R) AirPro XP seating system and backband, make the Focus comfortable for long paddling excursions. Hull is crafted in high-density polyethylene for amazing durability and easy care. Foot-pedal-controlled rudder system with cockpit deployment controls helps you steer and track effectively. Easily accessible front hatch and a smaller stern hatch offers ample storage space for dry bags and extra gear. Stern hatch, bow hatch and small midship day hatch all have bulkheads to keep gear dry and secure.
