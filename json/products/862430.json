Wide-mouth door orientation gives all sleepers equal access to the 2 doors-no need to crawl over a tentmate to get in and out. Large doors have solid fabric for privacy and mesh for ventilation; doors tuck into roof pockets. 2 roof vents help control condensation; zippered access allows campers to adjust the vents from inside the tent. Color coding and equal-length poles simplify setup. Large pole-supported vestibule and a smaller stake-out vestibule provide covered storage front and rear. Coated 150-denier polyester oxford floor is abrasion- and puncture-resistant. Full-coverage polyester rainfly is resistant to stretching and UV rays. Multiple pockets and hang loops help organize the interior. The REI Base Camp 6 Tent comes with a convenient backpack-style storage sack, stakes, guylines and tighteners, as well as a pole-repair tube, a pole bag and a stake bag. The REI Base Camp 6 Footprint is sold separately.","short_description":"The REI Base Camp 6 Tent combines mountaineering-inspired geodesic-dome architecture and rugged materials to create a roomy and robust campground shelter.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Tents","product_group":"Camping Tents","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s424455.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l424455.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=424455&tt=df","retail_price":"429.00","sale_price":"429.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=424455\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m424455.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=862430&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8624300001":{"sku":"8624300001","vendor_sku":"16400","upc":"486243000012","color":"SAGE/MESA ORANGE","retail_price":"429.00","sale_price":"429.00"}}}
