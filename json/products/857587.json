{"sku":"857587","manufacturer_id":"BUS05443","brand_name":"Novara","product_name":" Novara Trenta Bike - 2014","long_description":"A serious road machine for long, fast rides and personal bests, our Novara Trenta features a lightweight high-performance wheelset, light Shimano Ultegra components and a stiff, nimble frame. American Classic Victory 30 wheels offer an aerodynamic profile, weight-saving low spoke count and durable, smooth-spinning performance. Lightweight frame features triple-butted, hydroformed tubes and offers a lively ride quality with a geometry that balances all-day comfort, agile handling and responsiveness. Fork boasts a tapered alloy steerer with a machined, 1-piece alloy crown for strength and stiffness where it counts; carbon legs help damp road vibrations and reduce weight. Tapered steerer enhances stiffness and responsiveness for confident, precise handling. Shimano Ultegra shifters and derailleurs offer light-action, precise shifts throughout the 22 gear combinations. FSA Gossamer Pro compact crankset and 11-28 cassette ensure you've got the right gearing for the task at hand, be it a challenging climb or a feisty city-limit sprint. Slim-profile, standard reach caliper brakes ensure responsive, powerful braking for subtly shaving off speed in the group or dumping mph's coming into a hairpin on a descent. Clement Strada LGG tires have a slightly textured center tread with a more-pronounced shoulder tread for good all-around traction and low rolling resistance. Please note: Pedals are not included. Specs on our Novara Trenta bike are subject to change.","short_description":"A serious road machine for long, fast rides and personal bests, our Novara Trenta features a lightweight high-performance wheelset, light Shimano Ultegra components and a stiff, nimble frame.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bikes","product_group":"Road Bikes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s374551.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l374551.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=374551&tt=df","retail_price":"1699.00","sale_price":"1699.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=374551\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m374551.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=857587&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8575870001":{"sku":"8575870001","vendor_sku":"BUS05443","upc":"485758700011","size":"S","color":"WHITE","retail_price":"1699.00","sale_price":"1699.00"},"8575870002":{"sku":"8575870002","vendor_sku":"BUS05443","upc":"485758700028","size":"M","color":"WHITE","retail_price":"1699.00","sale_price":"1699.00"},"8575870004":{"sku":"8575870004","vendor_sku":"BUS05443","upc":"485758700042","size":"XL","color":"WHITE","retail_price":"1699.00","sale_price":"1699.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bikes","road-bikes"]}
