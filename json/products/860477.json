{"sku":"860477","manufacturer_id":"6220N1.MF","brand_name":"Marker","product_name":"Marker M 7.0 Free Bindings - Juniors'","long_description":"Sized right for up-and-coming freestyle masters weighing between 53 and 165 lbs., the Marker M 7.0 Free bindings provide reliable release and great skiing performance. During a backward or twisting fall, the Biotech(R) toe's upward-release system reduces the forces playing against young joints and bones. Lightweight Compact Junior Heel offers optimum performance and easy step-in/step-out convenience. Edge Pressure System equalizes the force between the toe and the heel for clean carving, enhanced edge hold and improved stability. Stainless-steel antifriction device allows essential lateral boot movement despite dirty or worn soles or negative sliding friction. 85mm-wide brakes fit most junior powder and freestyle skis. Catering to lightweight skiers, DIN range of 2 - 7 allows bindings to release boots easily in the event of a tumble.","short_description":"Sized right for up-and-coming freestyle masters weighing between 53 and 165 lbs., the Marker M 7.0 Free bindings provide reliable release and great skiing performance.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Bindings","product_group":"Downhill Ski Bindings","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s381619.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l381619.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=381619&tt=df","retail_price":"119.00","sale_price":"119.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=381619\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m381619.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=860477&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8604770001":{"sku":"8604770001","vendor_sku":"6220N1.MF","upc":"883295103690","size":"85 MM","color":"BLK/ANTH/GREEN","retail_price":"119.00","sale_price":"119.00"}},"categories":["snow","ski-bindings","downhill-ski-bindings"]}
