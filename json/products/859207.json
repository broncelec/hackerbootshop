{"sku":"859207","manufacturer_id":"BK1412I","brand_name":"Surly","product_name":" Surly Pugsley Bike - 2014","long_description":"Created to go where other bikes flounder, the fat-tire Surly Pugsley bike offers enhanced traction across sand, mud, wet rocks and roots, ice and many kinds of snow thanks to its oversize tires. Big, fat tires provide lots of flotation, more ground contact and better traction, especially when run at low pressures, allowing the tires to ride over obstacles. Frame is made of sturdy 4130 chromoly steel with double-butted tubing in the main triangle for strength. SRAM X5 36/22 crankset is matched up with Shimano derailleurs and Microshift shifters to create a smooth, easily shiftable drivetrain, even with gloves on. Horizontal dropouts with a derailleur hanger mean you can run the Pugsley as-is, or go to an internally geared hub, fixie or single-speed later on. Avid BB7 mechanical disc brakes facilitate controlled deceleration and sure stopping power in mixed conditions. Finer details include 2 water bottle mounts and guides for continuous brake/shift housing to protect cables in harsh conditions. The Pugsley also has rack and fender eyelets (rack and fenders not included-please note: rack and fenders will need to accommodate oversize tires). Pedals not included. Specs on the Surly Pugsley bike are subject to change.","short_description":"Created to go where other bikes flounder, the fat-tire Surly Pugsley bike offers enhanced traction across sand, mud, wet rocks and roots, ice and many kinds of snow thanks to its oversize tires.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bikes","product_group":"Mountain Bikes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s374779.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l374779.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=374779&tt=df","retail_price":"1750.00","sale_price":"1750.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=374779\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m374779.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859207&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8592070001":{"sku":"8592070001","vendor_sku":"BK1400I","upc":"485920700016","size":"XS","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"1750.00","sale_price":"1750.00"},"8592070005":{"sku":"8592070005","vendor_sku":"BK1404I","upc":"485920700054","size":"XL","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"1750.00","sale_price":"1750.00"},"8592070006":{"sku":"8592070006","vendor_sku":"BK1410I","upc":"485920700061","size":"XS","color":"BLUE","retail_price":"1750.00","sale_price":"1750.00"},"8592070008":{"sku":"8592070008","vendor_sku":"BK1412I","upc":"485920700085","size":"M","color":"BLUE","retail_price":"1750.00","sale_price":"1750.00"},"8592070010":{"sku":"8592070010","vendor_sku":"BK1414I","upc":"485920700108","size":"XL","color":"BLUE","retail_price":"1750.00","sale_price":"1750.00"}}}
