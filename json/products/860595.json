{"sku":"860595","manufacturer_id":"L356483PM","brand_name":"Salomon","product_name":"Salomon Snowscape 7 Cross-Country Skis with SNS Pilot Bindings","long_description":"Easy and predicatable, the Salomon Snowscape 7 cross-country skis with SNS Pilot bindings are great for beginner to intermediate skiers who want to explore groomed and ungroomed trails. Shorter-than-traditional ski length enhances maneuverability and control; ski camber is optimized to work with the short length for excellent grip and glide. Densolite 1000 core features preshaped Densolite foam with a unidirectional fiberglass wrap to keep the ski light and lively. Light carving sidecut puts the narrowest point near the binding area for control while gliding and sliding. G2 Plus waxless pattern on the base of the skis has sharp grip edges that bite into snow for good climbing performance. G1 sintered bases provide good glide in all conditions and require little maintenance. Salomon Snowscape 7 cross-country skis are pre-mounted with Salomon SNS Pilot(R) Sport Classic bindings; bindings have automatic step-in system and pole or manual step-out. Pilot system uses 2 connection points on each binding and a rigid link to enhance torsional rigidity and boost energy from every stride. Bindings are compatible with all SNS(R) Pilot classic boots (sold separately).","short_description":"Easy and predicatable, the Salomon Snowscape 7 cross-country skis with SNS Pilot bindings are great for beginner to intermediate skiers who want to explore groomed and ungroomed trails.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Cross-Country Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s452471.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l452471.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=452471&tt=df","retail_price":"229.95","sale_price":"206.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=452471\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m452471.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=860595&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{},"extended_xml_attributes":"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t","categories":["snow","skis","crosscountry-skis"]}
