Features 2 high-output DoublePower LEDs-1 for using the Voyager as a lantern around camp and the other for using the unit as a flashlight while hiking. LEDs can be turned on at the same time to eliminate the dark spot that you generally see below a hanging lantern. DoublePower lantern LED outputs 75 lumens to light up your campsite; DoublePower flashlight LED brightens the trail with 50 lumens. Fine-tune the output of either LED with the dimming switch-simply hold down the on/off button to activate dimmer. Lantern illuminates an area approximately 32 ft. in diameter. Collapsible design saves space in your pack and protects on/off button from accidental activation. Double-hook hanging system on top provides a simple and secure thread-through or clip-in attachment point for string, fabric loops or branches. IPX4 water-resistant construction delivers reliability in inclement weather. Rubber feet stabilize lantern when set on table or ground. 4 AA batteries, sold separately, power the Black Diamond Voyager lantern for up to 100 hrs. on low and 13 hrs. on high.","short_description":"The Black Diamond Voyager lantern lights up your camp with a soft glow, and it has the added ability to be used as a flashlight when you're hiking around at night.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Camp Lighting","product_group":"Lanterns","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s417339.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l417339.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=417339&tt=df","retail_price":"39.95","sale_price":"39.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=417339\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m417339.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=839966&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8399660001":{"sku":"8399660001","vendor_sku":"620706","upc":"793661175599","color":"DARK SHADOW","retail_price":"39.95","sale_price":"39.95"},"8399660002":{"sku":"8399660002","vendor_sku":"620706","upc":"793661175605","color":"PROCESS BLUE","retail_price":"39.95","sale_price":"39.95"},"8399660003":{"sku":"8399660003","vendor_sku":"620706","upc":"793661175612","color":"ULTRA WHITE","retail_price":"39.95","sale_price":"39.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","camp-lighting","lanterns"]}
