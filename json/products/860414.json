{"sku":"860414","manufacturer_id":"U130100101230","brand_name":"Atlas","product_name":"Atlas 1223 Elektra Snowshoes - Women's","long_description":"Stride with confidence on snowy trails with the Atlas Electra 1223 women's snowshoes. The frames are shaped to accommodate a women's natural gait and the bindings are built to fit women's boots. Women-specific V-shaped frames are made from 7075 aluminum; they are the lightest and strongest Atlas offers, and have a stiff, responsive flex for smooth, easy striding. Nose and tail shapes are optimized to provide a balanced platform for stable footing and to facilitate easy, natural striding for women. Wrapp(TM) Pro bindings use low-friction ratcheting buckles, silicone straps and free-floating, padded tongues to supply a precise, comfortable and supportive fit. Tenacious, stainless-steel toe crampons deeply penetrate the firmest snow and bite into icy slopes. Stainless-steel serrated heel cleats and side traction rails provide sure footing while traversing and descending the most technical terrain. Spring-Loaded(TM) suspension uses offset webbing straps to create a springy platform beneath the feet that absorbs impact and allows natural side-to-side flex. Lightweight Duratek(TM) nylon decks are tough and built to withstand harsh, cold conditions; textured surfaces resist abrasion. Heel lift bars on the Atlas Elektra 1223 snowshoes relieve calf muscle fatigue during the climbs; bars store flat when disengaged. Snowshoes measure 8.25 x 23 in. and have a recommended load weight of 80 to 160 lbs.; recommended load specification includes weight of hiker with gear.","short_description":"Stride with confidence on snowy trails with the Atlas Electra 1223 women's snowshoes.
