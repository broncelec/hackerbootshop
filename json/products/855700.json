{"sku":"855700","manufacturer_id":"157303","brand_name":"Smc","product_name":" SMC CR Crevasse Rescue Pulley","long_description":"As one of the strongest and lightest pulleys available, the SMC CR Crevasse Rescue pulley provides the mechanical advantage you need in the unlikely event you must haul your partner out of a crevasse. Weighing only 52g and with a breaking strength of 22kN, the SMC CR Crevasse Rescue pulley is lightweight yet very strong, making it ideal for alpine climbers and mountaineers. Compact pulley fits easily in a pocket or can be clipped to your climbing harness so it's ready for an emergency. A great choice for setting up 2:1 C-systems and 3:1 Z-systems for hauling a fallen climber out of a crevasse. Base design keeps a prusik knot from jamming in the pulley when you're hauling; works well with prusik cord up to 8mm in diameter. Solid side plates prevent objects that could cause a snag from entering the pulley. SMC CR Crevasse Rescue pulley accommodates ropes up to 13mm in diameter. Not suitable for use in a Tyrolean traverse.","short_description":"As one of the strongest and lightest pulleys available, the SMC CR Crevasse Rescue pulley provides the mechanical advantage you need in the unlikely event you must haul your partner out of a crevasse.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Hardware","product_group":"Pulleys","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s453247.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l453247.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=453247&tt=df","retail_price":"14.95","sale_price":"14.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=453247\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m453247.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=855700&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8557000002":{"sku":"8557000002","vendor_sku":"157303","upc":"087044900560","color":"ORANGE","retail_price":"14.95","sale_price":"14.95"}},"categories":["climbing","climbing-hardware","pulleys"]}
