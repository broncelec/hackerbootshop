{"sku":"859536","manufacturer_id":"A130300901192","brand_name":"Line","product_name":" Line Sick Day 125 Skis - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Supplying massive flotation for epic powder days with rockered tips and powerful construction, the Line Sick Day 125 skis are light, playful, and easy to handle when you're surfing the deep stuff. Tip and tail rocker floats high in backcountry powder whether skiing forward or switch; relatively low rise planes through powder instead of plowing up and over. Core consists of light and strong maple wood stringers surrounded by aspen wood to provide power, stability and long-lasting responsiveness. Widest points of the tip and tail are close to the center of the ski, reducing tail drag and hooking in powder. Cap construction on top of skis reduces weight and sidewalls over the edges enhance responsiveness. Softer tips float and initiate turns easily while stiffer tails provide powerful turn exits and stability. Geometry of skis incorporates 5 different turn radii to create effortless turn initiation with solid edge hold and responsive exits. Thin core in the tips reduces weight and makes the skis easier to control. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo. Line Sick Day 125 skis feature 125mm waists that require bindings with wide brakes.","short_description":"Supplying massive flotation for epic powder days with rockered tips and powerful construction, the Line Sick Day 125 skis are light, playful, and easy to handle when you're surfing the deep stuff.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382191.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382191.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382191&tt=df","retail_price":"749.95","sale_price":"449.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382191\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382191.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859536&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8595360002":{"sku":"8595360002","vendor_sku":"A130300901192","upc":"886745207658","size":"192 CM","retail_price":"449.93","sale_price":"449.93"},"8595360003":{"sku":"8595360003","vendor_sku":"A130300901186","upc":"886745226109","size":"186 CM","retail_price":"449.93","sale_price":"449.93"}}}
