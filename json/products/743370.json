The TRV lets you carry snowboard or ski boots, helmet and much more. Waterproof, triangular center compartment keeps your clothing and gear separate from the vented, zippered side boot compartments. Stowable padded neoprene shoulder straps let you carry your gear on your back in comfort, freeing up your hands for your board or skis and poles. Additional ripstop side pockets offer ample storage for tools, keys or other miscellaneous quick-access items. Zippered pockets on the lid and inside offer additional organization; all pocket zippers have toggle pulls for ease of use with gloves or mittens. Durable 1,680-denier coated ballistic nylon shell with rubberized bottom endures the wear and tear of travel and storage.","short_description":"It could be the ultimate design in a boot bag!
