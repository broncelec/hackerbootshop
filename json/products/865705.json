FOX 32 Float 29 Evolution CTD Air suspension fork boasts 100mm of travel that can be easily adjusted with the 3-mode setting adjustment (Climb, Trail, Descend). RideLoc system provides remote, bar-top control of the suspension travel and lockout, letting you customize performance on the fly. Lightweight, butted aluminum frame is tuned to optimize efficiency in the climbs and remain responsive when descending. Shimano XT rear derailleur and SLX shifters and front derailleur provide reliable shifting performance throughout the 30 gears of the 3x10 drivetrain. Shimano hydraulic disc brakes provide easy, progressive braking with a 180mm rotor up front and a 160mm rotor in the back. Sturdy wheels are wrapped with the excellent all-arounder Schwalbe Rocket Ron tires to ensure great traction and fast-rolling performance on the trail. Full-length cable housing deters gunky buildup that saps shifting performance; replaceable rear derailleur hanger helps extend the frame's usable lifespan.
