{"sku":"814315","manufacturer_id":"MTI-705A-0GB56","brand_name":"Mti","product_name":"MTI PFDiva PFD - Women's","long_description":"The PFDiva by MTI takes your paddling comfort to the next level with women-specific padding. Memory foam pads inside front of the vest personalize fit and add support. By filling the space under the bust, the memory foam evens out the contact between the body and the jacket, resulting in a remarkable difference in fit. 2 cargo pockets, 4-way lash tab and a single mesh pocket provide plenty of room for storing essentials. Short torso cut and racerback allows maximum mobility, minimal ride-up and great fit. Adjustable shoulder, waist and Z-adjust side straps make fine-tuning your fit quick and easy. Reflective tape accents on front, back and shoulders of the MTI PFDiva enhance visibility in low light. Cordura(R) nylon and closed-cell foam offer lasting performance.","short_description":"The PFDiva by MTI takes your paddling comfort to the next level with women-specific padding.","category":"Paddling","subcategory":"Pfds","product_group":"Women's Pfds","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s431995.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l431995.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=431995&tt=df","retail_price":"140.00","sale_price":"140.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=431995\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m431995.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=814315&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8143150003":{"sku":"8143150003","vendor_sku":"MTI-705A-0GB34","upc":"762894033730","size":"S/M","color":"FRACTAL GREEN/BLUE","retail_price":"140.00","sale_price":"140.00"},"8143150004":{"sku":"8143150004","vendor_sku":"MTI-705A-0GB56","upc":"762894033747","size":"L/XL","color":"FRACTAL GREEN/BLUE","retail_price":"140.00","sale_price":"140.00"}},"categories":["paddling","pfds","womens-pfds"]}
