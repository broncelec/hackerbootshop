{"sku":"857900","manufacturer_id":"B130303901120","brand_name":"K2","product_name":"K2 Stark Kwicker Snowboard Boots - 2013/2014","long_description":"K2 Stark Kwicker Snowboard boots are made to work exclusively with K2 Kwicker bindings. With Boa(TM) lacing and Intuition(TM) liners, these boots bring amazing comfort all over the mountain. Kwicker outsoles let you step into Kwicker bindings (sold separately)-no fussing with straps; to release boots, simple pull handle on bindings. The Kwicker system is one of the lightest splitboard-specific systems available. Endo internal highbacks provide support when cranking turns, making it possible to ride bindings without built-in highbacks. Intuition(TM) Pro Foam 3D stitched liners feature high-density Ultralon(TM), internal/external J bars for support, and a powerstrap for a snug, secure fit around legs. K2 Boa Conda liner lacing system allows on-the-fly control of ankle support and heel hold while the shells are still fully laced by external Boa reels. Smooth-functioning Boa reels anchor shells and liners together for perfect alignment; harness lacing through the floating tongue allows a personalized fit. 3D-formed, dual-density EVA footbeds feature Harshmellow(TM) cushioning to smooth out bumps and landings. Kwicker light outsoles provide traction on slick surfaces, and feature the Kwicker Outsole plates for easy binding attachment.","short_description":"K2 Stark Kwicker Snowboard boots are made to work exclusively with K2 Kwicker bindings.
