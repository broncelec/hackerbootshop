{"sku":"860490","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":"REI Carbon Power Lock Women's Trekking Poles - Pair","long_description":"Offering high-performance stability and power for diverse hiking terrains, REI Carbon Power Lock Women's Trekking Poles have a lightweight design and reliable, easily adjusted locking mechanisms. Women-specific design is lighter and shorter, and features a smaller grip than its unisex counterpart. Carbon fiber creates ultralight poles that damp vibration and retain strength over a wide temperature range. Power Lock external locking mechanisms are easy to use-even at low temperatures and when wearing gloves. REI Carbon Power Lock Women's Trekking Poles have EVA foam grips that are contoured to fit comfortably in your hands; adjustable, padded wrist straps add support. Poles are fitted with trekking baskets and durable tungsten carbide tips; included tip protectors are for travel/packing protection (not intended for hiking). Trekking baskets promote stability on soft terrain; baskets are easily twisted on and off if you want to replace them with snow baskets (sold separately).","short_description":"Offering high-performance stability and power for diverse hiking terrains, REI Carbon Power Lock Women's Trekking Poles have a lightweight design and reliable, easily adjusted locking mechanisms.","category":"Camping & Hiking","subcategory":"Hiking Staffs And Trekking Poles","product_group":"Trekking Poles","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s351227.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l351227.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=351227&tt=df","keywords":"collapsible,climbing,adjustable,stick,Pole","retail_price":"129.00","sale_price":"129.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=351227\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m351227.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=860490&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8604900001":{"sku":"8604900001","vendor_sku":"175 23 250-10","upc":"486049000018","color":"BACHELOR BUTTON","retail_price":"129.00","sale_price":"129.00"}}}
