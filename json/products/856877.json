{"sku":"856877","manufacturer_id":"FI13M5FUSTBLK5X","brand_name":"Flow","product_name":" Flow Fuse-AT Snowboard Bindings - 2013/2014","long_description":"If you prefer the feeling of molded baseplates instead of aluminum ones but don't want to compromise performance, choose the Flow Fuse-AT snowboard bindings for your all-mountain pursuits. Rockered nylon baseplates feature 2.5deg Canted BankBeds for response, support and a natural feel when strapped in. Modback highbacks feature separated upper flexible zones and lower nylon heel cup zones; upper zone uses independently adjustable support panels for fine-tuned performance. New Active Strap Technology (N.A.S.T.Y) straps automatically lift up when you open the reclining highbacks and actively tighten when you close the highback. N.A.S.T.Y straps reduce friction and create more room for easy in and out of bindings-using Flow bindings is now even easier. Four-way adjustable ATM.7 support lets you fine-tine the flex and shape for overall support. Power Triangle design links the highbacks directly to the center area of the baseplates with a high-tensile steel cable, increasing control and power transfer. One-piece active I-FUSION PowerStrap wraps around boots for a secure and comfortable hold. LockingSlapRatchet (LSR) buckles offer dual entry into bindings, either SpeedEntry or SideEntry-just slap them to open or lock them down to shred. Bindings are compatible with Burton The Channel snowboards and include disc kit.","short_description":"If you prefer the feeling of molded baseplates instead of aluminum ones but don't want to compromise performance, choose the Flow Fuse-AT snowboard bindings for your all-mountain pursuits.","category":"Snowboarding","subcategory":"Snowboard Bindings","product_group":"Speed-Entry Snowboard Bindings","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382915.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382915.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382915&tt=df","retail_price":"249.95","sale_price":"199.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382915\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382915.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=856877&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8568770001":{"sku":"8568770001","vendor_sku":"FI13M5FUSTBLK4L","upc":"845493039126","size":"L","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"199.93","sale_price":"199.93"},"8568770002":{"sku":"8568770002","vendor_sku":"FI13M5FUSTBLK5X","upc":"845493039133","size":"XL","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"199.93","sale_price":"199.93"}},"categories":["snow","snowboard-bindings","speedentry-snowboard-bindings"]}
