{"sku":"838199","manufacturer_id":"F2300-10E","brand_name":"Wigwam","product_name":" Wigwam Merino Light Hiker Socks","long_description":"The Wigwam Merino Light Hiker socks offer no-itch, odor-resistant insulation and provide a comfortable, foot-hugging fit. Wool is the original easy-care fiber; it's crimp acts like a tiny spring that coils back into position for great cushioning and insulation. Wool has resilient shape recovery and it breathes with your body; it also keeps feet drier because it absorbs as much as 30% of its own weight in moisture before feeling damp. Nylon and polyester are versatile, hard-wearing fibers, and a measure of stretch makes them fit like a soft glove. Durable heels and toes; seamless toe closures ensure comfort for the long haul. Wigwam Merino Light Hiker socks have a fully cushioned fit and stay-put, crew-height legs. *Discount will be applied when you check out.
