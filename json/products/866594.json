{"sku":"866594","manufacturer_id":"234098-021","brand_name":"Scott","product_name":"Scott Solace 30 Compact Bike - 2014","long_description":"With reliable Shimano 105 components, a compact crankset and an all-carbon frame, the Scott Solace 30 Compact Bike provides dedicated riders with a balance of comfort and speed for long rides. Carbon-fiber frame features two zones, a stiff Power Zone around the drivetrain that transfers energy efficiently and a flexible and shock-damping cockpit Comfort Zone. Geometry is not as aggressive as a full-bred race bike, but it offers plenty of efficiency for long days in the saddle. The 1-1/8 in. full-carbon steerer enhances precision. Lightweight Shimano 105 derailleurs and shifters offer precise, dependable shifts throughout the 20 gear combinations. Geared for speed, the Shimano 105 50/34 compact crankset is paired with a 12-30 cassette to give you a \"just right\" gear for tough gradients and wide-open flats. Lightweight and smooth Syncros RP2.0 wheels are outfitted with fast and grippy Schwalbe Durano tires. Pedals sold separately. Specs on the Scott Solace 30 Compact road bike are subject to change.","short_description":"With reliable Shimano 105 components, a compact crankset and an all-carbon frame, the Scott Solace 30 Compact Bike provides dedicated riders with a balance of comfort and speed for long rides.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bikes","product_group":"Road Bikes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s465555.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l465555.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=465555&tt=df","retail_price":"2549.00","sale_price":"2549.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=465555\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m465555.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=866594&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8665940001":{"sku":"8665940001","vendor_sku":"234098-021","upc":"886118604640","size":"52 CM","color":"BLACK/WHITE/BLUE","retail_price":"2549.00","sale_price":"2549.00"},"8665940002":{"sku":"8665940002","vendor_sku":"234098-022","upc":"886118604657","size":"54 CM","color":"BLACK/WHITE/BLUE","retail_price":"2549.00","sale_price":"2549.00"},"8665940003":{"sku":"8665940003","vendor_sku":"234098-023","upc":"886118604664","size":"56 CM","color":"BLACK/WHITE/BLUE","retail_price":"2549.00","sale_price":"2549.00"},"8665940004":{"sku":"8665940004","vendor_sku":"234098-024","upc":"886118604671","size":"58 CM","color":"BLACK/WHITE/BLUE","retail_price":"2549.00","sale_price":"2549.00"},"8665940005":{"sku":"8665940005","vendor_sku":"234098-025","upc":"886118604688","size":"61 CM","color":"BLACK/WHITE/BLUE","retail_price":"2549.00","sale_price":"2549.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bikes","road-bikes"]}
