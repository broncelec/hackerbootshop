{"sku":"838150","manufacturer_id":"B120301502060","brand_name":"K2","product_name":"K2 Contour Snowboard Boots - Women's - 2012/2013","long_description":"K2 Contour snowboard boots are built for women who enjoy cozy feet and Boa(R) no-fuss adjustability. Internal and external Boa lacing personalize liner and shell fit while shock-absorbing Harshmellow padding soaks up the speed bumps. Intuition(TM) Control Foam 3D stitched liners feature dual-density Ultralon(R), a flexible thermal-formable EVA foam designed to resist pressure-related pack out. Internal and external J-bars hold heels securely; highly-supportive liner bottoms include molded, dual EVA insoles with Harshmellow pods for extra damping and support. K2 Boa Conda liner lacing system allows on-the-fly control of ankle support and heel hold while the shells are still fully laced by external Boa reels. Smooth-functioning Boa reels anchor shells and liners together for perfect alignment; harness lacing through the floating tongue allows a personalized fit. Dual-density, 3D-formed tongues prevent pressure points on legs. Boa(R) Coiler shell lacing, with ankle and cable guides along entire edge of eyestays, distributes closure force evenly for a dialed-in fit that won't loosen up. The Coiler scoops up loose cable when entering as well as exiting the boot; put your foot in, pull back on the tongue, twist the reel a few times and you're off. Grip-Light outsoles are constructed of super lightweight Phylon with areas of rubber and cushioned Harshmellow for lightweight support and superior traction.","short_description":"K2 Contour snowboard boots are built for women who enjoy cozy feet and Boa(R) no-fuss adjustability.","category":"Snowboarding","subcategory":"Snowboard Boots","product_group":"Women's Snowboard Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s461619.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l461619.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=461619&tt=df","retail_price":"279.95","sale_price":"139.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=461619\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m461619.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=838150&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8381500001":{"sku":"8381500001","vendor_sku":"B120301502060","upc":"886745008064","size":"6","color":"BROWN","retail_price":"139.83","sale_price":"139.83"},"8381500002":{"sku":"8381500002","vendor_sku":"B120301502065","upc":"886745008071","size":"6.5","color":"BROWN","retail_price":"139.83","sale_price":"139.83"},"8381500003":{"sku":"8381500003","vendor_sku":"B120301502070","upc":"886745008088","size":"7","color":"BROWN","retail_price":"139.83","sale_price":"139.83"},"8381500006":{"sku":"8381500006","vendor_sku":"B120301502085","upc":"886745008118","size":"8.5","color":"BROWN","retail_price":"139.83","sale_price":"139.83"}},"categories":["snow","snowboard-boots","womens-snowboard-boots"]}
