{"sku":"829624","manufacturer_id":"010-00741-20","brand_name":"Garmin","product_name":"Garmin Forerunner 910XT GPS Fitness Monitor","long_description":"You're a swimmer, a cyclist and a runner, and you crave data and details. Get the Garmin Forerunner(R) 910XT GPS fitness monitor to track your performance and help you hit a new personal record. Water resistant to 50m (165 ft.), 910XT handles open-water and pool swimming; watch measures swimming distance, identifies strokes and tracks strokes and pool lengths. Computes your \"Swim Golf\" (SWOLF) score, which is determined by adding the number of strokes taken per lap to the time it took to swim the lap, to help improve efficiency. On land, the 910XT uses GPS technology to accurately capture your time, distance, speed, pace and more to help you meet your running and biking goals. High-sensitivity GPS receiver stays locked onto satellites, even near tall buildings and under tree cover; HotFix(R) satellite prediction locks onto satellites quickly. GPS also captures the path you travel while swimming in open water so you can analyze it later to help improve your technique. Virtual Racer(TM) feature lets you race against your previous best time or challenge other users' times that have been uploaded to the Garmin Connect(TM) website. Virtual Partner(R) allows you to compete against a static pace that you set before heading out for your run. Interval training function lets you set up custom exercise sessions and automatically see your pace for each interval. Switch between sport modes with just 1 button press, so you don't waste precious time in transition. Barometric altimeter provides accurate elevation data, including ascent, descent and grade. Mark locations, save locations or navigate back to the starting point with the basic navigation capabilities. Customize the display of training pages for each sport; set up vibration alerts to nudge you when you hit a split time, need to eat or want feedback so you can stay on track.","short_description":"You're a swimmer, a cyclist and a runner, and you crave data and details.
