{"sku":"856999","manufacturer_id":"7022917","brand_name":"Giro","product_name":"Giro Edit Snow Helmet - Men's","long_description":"Pull on the Giro Edit snow helmet and attach your GoPro camera (sold separately) to the sleek, integrated mount to capture every epic descent, back flip and big crash on video. GoPro easily affixes to the mount on the front of the Edit helmet without straps or adhesives; stealthy mount is barely visible when when you remove the camera. In-mold technology fuses the helmet's tough outer shell to the internal expanded polystyrene (EPS) liner, creating a light, cool and strong 1-piece helmet. 10 vents move cool, fresh air through the helmet while allowing heat and stale air out; Stack Vent(TM) at the center front of the helmet helps move moisture from goggles. Fine-tune the airflow using 2 low-profile Thermostat(TM) control buttons located on the outside of the helmet; buttons open and close vents. Roc Loc 5 fit system lets you easily tune the fit tension and fore/aft tilt of the helmet in just seconds with a single hand. X-Static(R) antimicrobial padding helps control odors. Giro Edit snow helmet is compatible with all Giro audio systems (sold separately). This snow helmet complies with ASTM F 2040 and/or CE EN 1077 alpine ski and snowboard helmet safety standards; for additional information please see REI expert advice.","short_description":"Pull on the Giro Edit snow helmet and attach your GoPro camera (sold separately) to the sleek, integrated mount to capture every epic descent, back flip and big crash on video.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Helmets","product_group":"Men's Ski Helmets","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s381447.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l381447.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=381447&tt=df","retail_price":"180.00","sale_price":"125.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=381447\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m381447.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=856999&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8569990001":{"sku":"8569990001","vendor_sku":"7022921","upc":"768686939754","size":"S","color":"MATTE BLACK FADER","retail_price":"125.93","sale_price":"125.93"},"8569990002":{"sku":"8569990002","vendor_sku":"7022922","upc":"768686939761","size":"M","color":"MATTE BLACK FADER","retail_price":"125.93","sale_price":"125.93"},"8569990004":{"sku":"8569990004","vendor_sku":"7022931","upc":"768686946844","size":"M","color":"MATTE ORANGE","retail_price":"125.93","sale_price":"125.93"},"8569990005":{"sku":"8569990005","vendor_sku":"7022932","upc":"768686946851","size":"L","color":"MATTE ORANGE","retail_price":"125.93","sale_price":"125.93"},"8569990006":{"sku":"8569990006","vendor_sku":"7022913","upc":"485699900068","size":"M","color":"MATTE GREEN","retail_price":"125.93","sale_price":"125.93"},"8569990014":{"sku":"8569990014","vendor_sku":"7022916","upc":"768686941955","size":"M","color":"HIGHLIGHT YELLOW","retail_price":"125.93","sale_price":"125.93"},"8569990015":{"sku":"8569990015","vendor_sku":"7022917","upc":"768686941962","size":"L","color":"HIGHLIGHT YELLOW","retail_price":"125.93","sale_price":"125.93"}},"categories":["snow","ski-helmets","mens-ski-helmets"]}
