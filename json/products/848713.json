{"sku":"848713","manufacturer_id":"53440","brand_name":"Camelbak","product_name":" CamelBak Glass eddy Bottle - 24 fl. oz.","long_description":"Enjoy spill-proof sipping at home or in the office with the crystal-clear CamelBak Glass eddy(TM) water bottle. Redesigned cap and Big Bite valve provide faster flow than previous versions; just bite and sip, and your beverage flows through the valve. Bottle is made from glass, which is naturally BPA free and doesn't retain taste; silicone sleeve protects the bottle from impacts and ensures you have a good grip on it. If lifting and tipping is your preferred method for drinking, no problem; just remove the straw inside. Carry the integrated handle in the crook of a finger, or connect it to a pack or waistbelt with a small carabiner (not included). Simply unscrew the cap to uncover bottle's wide-mouth opening for easy filling and cleaning; opening is compatible with standard 63mm caps, filters and accessories. Not for use with hot liquids. All CamelBak Glass eddy water bottle components are dishwasher safe (top rack only). CamelBak does not recommend the use of carbonated beverages with the straw configuration; remove straw and drink by tipping and sipping.","short_description":"Enjoy spill-proof sipping at home or in the office with the crystal-clear CamelBak Glass eddy(TM) water bottle.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Water Bottles And Treatment","product_group":"Water Bottles, Flasks And Jugs","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s425771.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l425771.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=425771&tt=df","retail_price":"25.00","sale_price":"25.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=425771\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m425771.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=848713&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8487130001":{"sku":"8487130001","vendor_sku":"53439","upc":"886798534398","size":".7 LTR","color":"CHARCOAL","retail_price":"25.00","sale_price":"25.00"},"8487130002":{"sku":"8487130002","vendor_sku":"53440","upc":"886798534404","size":".7 LTR","color":"AQUA","retail_price":"25.00","sale_price":"25.00"},"8487130003":{"sku":"8487130003","vendor_sku":"53441","upc":"886798534411","size":".7 LTR","color":"PURPLE","retail_price":"25.00","sale_price":"25.00"},"8487130004":{"sku":"8487130004","vendor_sku":"53442","upc":"886798534428","size":".7 LTR","color":"LIME","retail_price":"25.00","sale_price":"25.00"}}}
