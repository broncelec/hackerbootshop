Meant for kids weighing less than 44 lbs., they encourage confidence with their flexible, lightweight construction. Princess skis with bindings are ideal for groomed trails at low to medium speeds. Cap construction keeps skis light and fun and boosts durability. Forgiving microcell-foam core won't punish a developing skier for small mistakes, yet it's responsive enough to encourage skill progression. Comp Kid Princess 25 bindings feature lightweight composite materials that ease turn transitions and make carrying skis a breeze. Design makes it easy to step into and exit the bindings, so kids can get in and out of their skis quickly. Catering to very lightweight skiers, DIN range of 0.5 - 2.5 allows bindings to release boots easily in the event of a tumble. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.","short_description":"Girls making their first turns will love the Rossignol Princess skis with bindings.
