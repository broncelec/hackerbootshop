{"sku":"850810","manufacturer_id":"W40075","brand_name":"Hydro Flask","product_name":"Hydro Flask Wide-Mouth Vacuum Bottle - 40 fl. oz.","long_description":"Whether you're climbing a mountain or heading to a friend's house, the 40 fl. oz. Hydro Flask Wide-Mouth vacuum bottle keeps your favorite cold beverage or hot soup at just the right temperature. Double-wall vacuum insulation keeps the contents hot for 12 hrs. or cold for 24 hrs. so you can warm up with cocoa or cool down with your favorite cold beverage. The inside temperature won't affect the outside temperature of the container-that means no burned fingers from hot beverages or condensation from ice-cold drinks. Wide-mouth opening is 2.19 in. in diameter, making it easy to fill the bottle with coffee, hot cocoa, soup, chili or your favorite cold beverage. Tough, food-grade 18/8 stainless steel is BPA free and resistant to bacteria and odors. Please note: Hydro Flask can't guarantee against leaks when the bottle is filled with carbonated beverages; keep the bottle upright.","short_description":"Whether you're climbing a mountain or heading to a friend's house, the 40 fl. oz.
