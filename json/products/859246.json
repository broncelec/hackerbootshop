{"sku":"859246","manufacturer_id":"L32598300","brand_name":"Salomon","product_name":"Salomon Quest 90 Ski Boots - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Strap on the intermediate-level Salomon Quest 90 ski boots, flip the switch to \"hike\" and go find untracked powder. Specialized ski/hike mechanism frees the upper cuff from the lower part of the boot and offers enough movement for comfortable hikes to untouched stashes. When you're ready to ski, the cuffs lock directly into the lower shells to maximize power transmission on the descent. Innovative V-shaped lower shell and magnesium backbone virtually eliminate flex when backbone is engaged. Waterproof gussets along the sides of the tongues help keep feet dry, even when hiking in deep powder. Comfortable liners feature a layer of custom-moldable foam that personalizes the fit around the shins. Liners disperse more moisture than standard liners; they feature wicking layers of mesh, foam and insulation to transfer sweat away from feet to keep them dry and warm. Closed-cell foam under the boot boards softens hard landings. With a medium flex index of 90, Salomon Quest 90 ski boots offer the responsive flex preferred by intermediate skiers.","short_description":"Strap on the intermediate-level Salomon Quest 90 ski boots, flip the switch to \"hike\" and go find untracked powder.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Downhill Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382539.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382539.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382539&tt=df","retail_price":"399.00","sale_price":"318.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382539\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382539.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859246&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8592460001":{"sku":"8592460001","vendor_sku":"L32598300","upc":"080694079407","size":"Mondo 26.5","color":"CRYSTAL TRANS/BLACK","retail_price":"318.93","sale_price":"318.93"},"8592460004":{"sku":"8592460004","vendor_sku":"L32598300","upc":"080694064762","size":"Mondo 29.5","color":"CRYSTAL TRANS/BLACK","retail_price":"318.93","sale_price":"318.93"}},"categories":["snow","ski-boots","downhill-ski-boots"]}
