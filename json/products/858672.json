{"sku":"858672","manufacturer_id":"301551","brand_name":"Dalbello","product_name":"Dalbello KR 2 Core Ski Boots - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Responsive and smooth, the advanced-level Dalbello KR Two Core ski boots offer the precision to aggressively romp down the mountain with ease thanks to snug lasts and anatomic boot molds. 98mm footbeds provide a responsive, precision fit designed for discriminating feet, but thanks to a new boot mold, the boots don't squeeze your feet like a vice. Boot mold enhances power, precision and comfort by matching 4 critical fit points: the heels, ankles, 5th metatarsals near your toes and the naviculars near insteps. Offering a precise foothold and a progressive forward flex, 3-piece shell optimizes responsiveness for today's relatively short, wide skis. Separate cuff, shell and tongue sections are joined together to create a smooth forward flex with precise side-to-side support. Enhancing side-to-side response and providing a snugger wrap, bi-injected cuffs feature stiff plastic on sides and soft plastic on the straps that wrap around shins. Medium-flex tongues enhance responsiveness, control and sensitivity to skis and snow surface. Liners feature soft comfort foam around the rearfoot areas and tongues, and the toe boxes stretch to enhance comfort and fit. Liners are engineered to fit correctly right out of the box, but they can be custom formed as well, a procedure best performed in an REI specialty ski shop. Twin canting adjusts the cuffs to fit the angles of your lower legs, levels the soles of the boots above the skis and offers a versatile range of adjustment. Flex index of 110 offers the responsive power transfer preferred by advanced skiers.","short_description":"Responsive and smooth, the advanced-level Dalbello KR Two Core ski boots offer the precision to aggressively romp down the mountain with ease thanks to snug lasts and anatomic boot molds.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Downhill Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382519.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382519.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382519&tt=df","retail_price":"499.95","sale_price":"399.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382519\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382519.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=858672&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8586720002":{"sku":"8586720002","vendor_sku":"301551","upc":"616438301000","size":"Mondo 26.5","color":"BLACK/ANTHRACITE","retail_price":"399.93","sale_price":"399.93"},"8586720003":{"sku":"8586720003","vendor_sku":"301551","upc":"616438301024","size":"Mondo 27.5","color":"BLACK/ANTHRACITE","retail_price":"399.93","sale_price":"399.93"},"8586720004":{"sku":"8586720004","vendor_sku":"301551","upc":"616438301048","size":"Mondo 28.5","color":"BLACK/ANTHRACITE","retail_price":"399.93","sale_price":"399.93"},"8586720005":{"sku":"8586720005","vendor_sku":"301551","upc":"616438301062","size":"Mondo 29.5","color":"BLACK/ANTHRACITE","retail_price":"399.93","sale_price":"399.93"}},"categories":["snow","ski-boots","downhill-ski-boots"]}
