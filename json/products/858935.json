{"sku":"858935","manufacturer_id":"115063","brand_name":"Black Diamond","product_name":" Black Diamond Stigma Telemark / Randonee Skis - 2012/2013 Closeout","long_description":"As classic touring skis, the Black Diamond Stigma telemark/randonee skis are lightweight, nimble-but-stable performers from the skin track to tight, technical couloirs. Part of the Tour series, the Stigma specializes in long approaches and technical descents on both soft and hard snow. Lightweight paulownia wood core is surrounded by Torsion Box construction and carbon fiber reinforcements. Torsion Box technology wraps fiberglass around the core like a burrito, creating excellent torsional power and energy pop. Dual Torsion Bow(R) construction features two ribs that run the length of each ski to distribute loads. Soft tip flex pattern and a tight turning radius with 80mm waists make the Stigma skis ideal for quick turns on variable snow. Feature flat tails you can easily plunge into firm snow when building anchors or staking out a tent. Stainless-steel notches at the tails keep climbing skins (not included) securely attached and centered. Black Diamond Stigma skis have high-speed sintered bases that feature a cross-hatch stone grind for a balance of durability, glide and maintenance. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.
