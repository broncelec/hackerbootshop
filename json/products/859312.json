{"sku":"859312","manufacturer_id":"S131900401295","brand_name":"K2","product_name":"K2 SpYne 90 Ski Boots - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Ideal for new intermediates, the men's K2 SpYne 90 ski boots feature an innovative spine design, rivet-free technology and top-notch liners with very roomy 102mm footbeds for an emphasis on comfort. Innovative rigid spine connects cuff to shell without traditional rivets to smooth out the flex of the boots and provide lateral stiffness for performance on uneven terrain. Rigid spines allow the use of soft plastic in the cuffs and shells to damp vibrations in rough terrain and make boots easier to put on when it's cold. Top-notch liners boost precision and heat-moldable tongues absorb impacts and smooth vibrations. LuxFit INTUITION(R) liners offer a precise fit out of the box, but can be custom molded using a heat treatment. Asymmetric tongues enhance fit and offer a soft feel while you flex your knees into the turn, and adjustable spoilers allow you to personalize the angle of forward lean. Rubberized outsole pads between toes and heels increase traction when walking on rocks or riding on snowmobiles. The men's K2 SpYne 90 ski boots offer a medium flex suited to intermediate skiers.","short_description":"Ideal for new intermediates, the men's K2 SpYne 90 ski boots feature an innovative spine design, rivet-free technology and top-notch liners with very roomy 102mm footbeds for an emphasis on comfort.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Downhill Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382555.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382555.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382555&tt=df","retail_price":"399.95","sale_price":"239.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382555\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382555.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859312&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8593120004":{"sku":"8593120004","vendor_sku":"S131900401295","upc":"886745204640","size":"Mondo 29.5","color":"BLUE","retail_price":"239.93","sale_price":"239.93"}},"categories":["snow","ski-boots","downhill-ski-boots"]}
