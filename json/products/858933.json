{"sku":"858933","manufacturer_id":"115031","brand_name":"Black Diamond","product_name":"Black Diamond Warrant Telemark / Randonee Skis - 2012/2013 Closeout","long_description":"Like it or not, conditions aren't always full blown powder. Enter the Black Diamond Warrant skis. Their construction provides solid bite into firm snow, yet they remain light and lively in soft snow. 95mm waists with full-length camber create a lively, snappy feel out of every turn. Traditional tip and tail curvature offers full-lenth edge contact and great stability on variable snow. 3D Sandwich poplar wood core construction and tapered ABS sidewalls pair with Dual Torsion Bow Technology for reliable torsional stiffness and edge hold when it counts. Dual Torsion Bow construction features two ribs that run the length of each ski to distribute loads and direct power to the edges. Notches at the tails keep climbing skins attached and centered (skins not included). High-speed sintered bases on the Black Diamond Warrant kis feature a cross-hatch stone grind for the best balance of durability, glide and maintenance. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo. Closeout.","short_description":"Like it or not, conditions aren't always full blown powder. Enter the Black Diamond Warrant skis.
