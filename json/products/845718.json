{"sku":"845718","manufacturer_id":"14415","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":"REI Radiant Down Sleeping Bag","long_description":"Take the REI Radiant down sleeping bag on all of your 3-season adventures. It's designed for the backpacker who prioritizes comfort over weight and wants a balance of performance and price. High-quality 650-fill-power duck down is warm, lightweight and compressible; bag has a temperature rating of 20degF. Relaxed fit from the shoulders to the hips increases comfort by providing ample space to move around. Exclusive REI Down Fill Calculator optimizes the amount of down per baffle for the most warmth with the least amount of down. Baffle spacing allows the down to remain fully lofted and keeps it from shifting, preventing cold spots. Ripstop nylon shell resists water and abrasion; smooth polyester taffeta lining is comfortable against your skin. Shell fabric is treated with a Durable Water Repellent finish to repel moisture and stains. Contoured hood, insulated full-face muffler and full-length draft tube with ground-level seams keep body heat in and cold air out. The REI Radiant down sleeping bag has an external chest pocket that stows your watch, glasses or other small essentials. Differentiated drawcords (1 round, 1 flat) let you adjust hood and neck easily in the dark. Full-length of zipper is backed by wide, antisnag binding tape. Any REI backpacking bag can be zipped to any other REI backpacking bag because of the consistent 63 in., No. 5, YKK zipper; women's bags zip on the right, men's on the left. Pad loops provide attachment points to keep your sleeping bag and pad together to avoid rolling off onto the cold ground (straps and sleeping pad sold separately). Includes stuff sack and storage bag. European Norm (EN) is an independent third-party temperature rating, allowing accurate comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags.","short_description":"Take the REI Radiant down sleeping bag on all of your 3-season adventures.
