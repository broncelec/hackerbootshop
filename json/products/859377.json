{"sku":"859377","manufacturer_id":"RRC03EJ","brand_name":"Rossignol","product_name":" Rossignol Temptation 82 Skis with Bindings - Women's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Built for advanced skiers, the women's Rossignol Temptation 82 skis with bindings boost confidence on difficult groomed terrain with stable 83mm waists and vibration-reducing laminates. Poplar wood core creates light and lively skis that transmit the feel of the snow and put you in touch with the terrain, and stiff basalt laminates reduce vibrations. Varying shapes of laminates reduce the weight of the tips, making them easier to control. Layered laminates in tips also smooth out turn initiation, improve edge contact during turns and increase side-to-side response. Subtle rocker in tips and tails offers easy steering in any snow conditions, and traditional camber underfoot provides tenacious edge grip. Extended sidecut works with the rockered tips and tails to provide full engagement of edges during turns at high speeds and easy maneuverability at low speeds. Vertical sidewalls in center of skis deliver excellent power transfer for superb grip on hardpack snow. Integrated bindings are designed for ease of use and comfort; lightweight composite materials ease turn initiation for effortless skiing. Integrated bindings feature DIN 3.5 - 11 release settings, a range suited to intermediate or advanced skiers at medium to high speeds. Base or topsheet color on the women's Rossignol Temptation 82 skis with bindings may vary from online photo.","short_description":"Built for advanced skiers, the women's Rossignol Temptation 82 skis with bindings boost confidence on difficult groomed terrain with stable 83mm waists and vibration-reducing laminates.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382131.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382131.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382131&tt=df","retail_price":"699.95","sale_price":"699.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382131\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382131.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859377&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8593770001":{"sku":"8593770001","vendor_sku":"RRC03EJ","size":"152 CM","retail_price":"699.95","sale_price":"699.95"},"8593770002":{"sku":"8593770002","vendor_sku":"RRC03EJ","size":"160 CM","retail_price":"699.95","sale_price":"699.95"}}}
