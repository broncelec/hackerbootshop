Slightly rockered tips make it easy to start turning at a moment's notice and offer forgiving stability in soft snow and crud. Very stable and easy to handle, the wood core of the Volkl RTM 75 skis offers a forgiving feel that won't punish you for small mistakes in technique. Raised reinforcement channels along the top edges of the skis, a distinct feature on all Volkl carvers, make the skis feel more stable at high speeds. Soft flexing tail makes it easy to release skis out of turns and avoid oncoming obstacles, a welcome feature if you are tackling tough slopes. Bindings attach to skis via integrated rails, eliminating screws and promoting superb edge hold and natural flex. Integrated bindings features DIN 3 - 10 release settings, a range suited to beginning and intermediate skiers at low to medium speeds. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.","short_description":"The Volkl RTM 75 skis with bindings are silky smooth carvers with rockered tips that make linking a series of turns down the mountain easy and fun.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382239.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382239.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382239&tt=df","retail_price":"599.00","sale_price":"399.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382239\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382239.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=860309&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8603090002":{"sku":"8603090002","vendor_sku":"113191.D21.166","upc":"821264547786","size":"166 CM","retail_price":"399.83","sale_price":"399.83"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
