Freestanding design means it also works well as a traditional shelter; 10 x 10 ft. floor dimensions fit nicely around a campground table. Accessory walls (sold separately) can be attached to the sides and ends to provide extra protection. The REI InCamp Shelter 100 offers ample headroom, thanks to an arched roof and vertical end walls. Coated polyester taffeta shelter fabric is waterproof, seam sealed and resistant to UV rays. Sturdy prebent aluminum poles simplify setup; perimeter webbing stabilizes the pole feet.","short_description":"The REI InCamp Shelter 100 is designed to easily dock with any REI InCamp tent (sold separately): Simply slide the shelter over the front door frame of your InCamp tent.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Tents","product_group":"Shelters","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s424651.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l424651.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=424651&tt=df","keywords":"canopy,beach","retail_price":"199.00","sale_price":"199.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=424651\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m424651.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=862436&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8624360001":{"sku":"8624360001","vendor_sku":"16404","upc":"486243600014","size":"10x10 FT","color":"MESA ORANGE/PLATINUM","retail_price":"199.00","sale_price":"199.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","tents","shelters"]}
