{"sku":"832059","manufacturer_id":"WS1111","brand_name":"Bob","product_name":" BOB Revolution Stroller Weather Shield","long_description":"Providing protection for passengers, the BOB Revolution Stroller weather shield offers easy-to-install fortification from the elements. Made of a water- and wind-resistant polyurethane-coated nylon shell with clear water-resistant TPU window so your child can see out, and you can see in. Vents are positioned to allow proper airflow while keeping your child completely dry. Designed specifically for BOB Revolution strollers, sold separately. Please note: stroller canopy must be in correct position for proper Weather Shield installation; 2011 and newer strollers have rip-and-stick tabs to facilitate this. Older strollers must use retrofit kit to replace the canopy drawcord; kit can be obtained from BOB by contacting their customer service department.","short_description":"Providing protection for passengers, the BOB Revolution Stroller weather shield offers easy-to-install fortification from the elements.","category":"Fitness","subcategory":"Running","product_group":"Strollers","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s427471.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l427471.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=427471&tt=df","retail_price":"55.00","sale_price":"55.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=427471\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m427471.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=832059&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8320590001":{"sku":"8320590001","vendor_sku":"WS1111","upc":"692176705461","retail_price":"55.00","sale_price":"55.00"}}}
