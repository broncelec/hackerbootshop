{"sku":"851437","manufacturer_id":"F1700269","brand_name":"Fizik","product_name":"Fizik Antares Versus Saddle - Men's","long_description":"Offering a full-length central channel, the Fizik Antares Versus bike saddle offers comfort and support for you, whether pushing the pace in the weekend group ride or putting in long base miles. Synthetic Microtex cover is durable, water resistant and washable, and will not fade; plus, it's lighter weight than leather. Central channel spans the length of the saddle to offer a relief zone for sensitive tissues. Nylon/carbon-reinforced shell provides lightweight support and comfort. K:ium alloy rails offer an excellent strength-to-weight ratio and comfort-enhancing vibration damping. The Antares Versus saddle is designed to offer support for those with moderate flexibility-when bent forward fully, one's hands hang midway down shins, not touching toes.","short_description":"Offering a full-length central channel, the Fizik Antares Versus bike saddle offers comfort and support for you, whether pushing the pace in the weekend group ride or putting in long base miles.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Components","product_group":"Bike Saddles And Seatposts","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s388983.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l388983.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=388983&tt=df","retail_price":"179.00","sale_price":"142.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=388983\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m388983.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=851437&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8514370001":{"sku":"8514370001","vendor_sku":"F1700269","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"142.93","sale_price":"142.93"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-components","bike-saddles-and-seatposts"]}
