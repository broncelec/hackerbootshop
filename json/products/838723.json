Its detachable sleeves let it double as a long-sleeve jacket and a short-sleeve jersey! Gore WINDSTOPPER(R) fabric eliminates windchill, yet it's breathable and quickly dissipates excess moisture to keep you dry and warm. Stretch inserts deliver superior freedom of movement. With a quick unzipping, long raglan sleeves come away to expose additional short sleeves-a great option to enjoy when the day warms up. Soft collar lies comfortably against skin. 3 rear pockets expand to store cycling essentials and food; the 2 end pockets are slanted for easy access. 4-way-stretch cuffs provide a snug yet flexible fit; stretch hem keeps cold air from creeping up your backside. Pre-shaped elbows allow a nonbinding fit and full range of motion while in cycling postion. A full-length zipper with draft flap lets you easily regulate heat inside the jersey. The GORE BIKE WEAR Phantom 2.0 soft-shell bike jacket has a slim fit to minimize wind resistance. Multiple reflective accents on the front, back and sides enhance your visibility in low light.","short_description":"The GORE BIKE WEAR Phantom 2.0 Soft-Shell Lady bike jacket is a smart choice for fall-to-spring riding.
