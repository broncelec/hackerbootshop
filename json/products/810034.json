{"sku":"810034","manufacturer_id":"05136","brand_name":"Msr","product_name":"MSR Carbon Reflex 1 Tent","long_description":"The Carbon Reflex 1 tent is the lightest, double-wall solo tent from MSR. It crosses the barrier from ultralight to hyperlight, and is ideal for any 3-season adventure you're ready to take on. And one of the best things about the Carbon Reflex 1 is its livability-it packs over 7 ft. of length, has plenty of room to sit up in and includes a roomy vestibule. Comparable to the MSR Hubba tent in volume, the carbon fiber poles and efficient design make the Carbon Reflex 1 nearly a pound lighter. Much lighter and stronger than aluminum, cutting-edge carbon fiber poles reduce frame weight by up to 30% over aluminum while adding significant strength. Unique geometry provides ample center height and steep sidewalls to maximize usable space; non-freestanding design saves precious weight. Clip construction ensures a fast and easy setup. Taped DuraShield(R)-coated fly and bathtub floor are durable and waterproof; all-mesh body offers livability beyond your expectations. 4 internal mesh pockets organize small gear. For a lightweight setup during nice weather, leave tent body behind; use the rainfly and footprint (sold separately) with the poles and stakes.","short_description":"The Carbon Reflex 1 tent is the lightest, double-wall solo tent from MSR.
