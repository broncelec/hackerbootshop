{"sku":"869146","manufacturer_id":"RMA-PC2FW-230","brand_name":"Aqua-Bound","product_name":"Aqua-Bound Manta Ray Hybrid Posi-Lok Kayak Paddle","long_description":"Designed for high-angle paddling, the broad blades of the Aqua-Bound Manta Ray Hybrid Posi-Lok carbon shaft paddle supply huge bite for athletic touring, workout paddling and racing. Simple, intuitive and strong, the Posi-Loc(R) ferrule uses a 2-button release to detach and adjust feather angle. To join, simply slide the Posi-Lok ferrule together and listen for the audible click. Posi-Lok ferrule resists corrosion and completely eliminates play between each piece of the paddle. Feathering is adjustable in the increments of 0 / 15 / 30 / 45 / 60 / 75deg right or left. Lightweight carbon shaft provides low swing weight and slight flex, promoting a comfortable experience in the cockpit from launch until takeout. Fiberglass-reinforced nylon blades provide excellent durability when pushing off rocks or barnacles. Wide, asymmetrical dihedral blade face is optimized for high-angle paddling and produces a smooth stroke with minimal flutter.","short_description":"Designed for high-angle paddling, the broad blades of the Aqua-Bound Manta Ray Hybrid Posi-Lok carbon shaft paddle supply huge bite for athletic touring, workout paddling and racing.","category":"Paddling","subcategory":"Paddles","product_group":"Kayak Paddles","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s463731.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l463731.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=463731&tt=df","retail_price":"139.95","sale_price":"139.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=463731\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m463731.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=869146&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8691460002":{"sku":"8691460002","vendor_sku":"RMA-PC2FW-220","upc":"717320485010","size":"220 CM","color":"WHITE","retail_price":"139.95","sale_price":"139.95"}},"categories":["paddling","paddles","kayak-paddles"]}
