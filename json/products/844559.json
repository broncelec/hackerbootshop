Lightweight, flexible synthetic textile and polyester mesh uppers offer maximum breathability and comfort. Wicking polyester linings move excess moisture away from feet and dry fast. Footbeds supply additional cushioning, offer antimicrobial performance and manage moisture for a cool, dry and comfortable interior.

Forefoot and hindfoot GEL(R) silicone-based cushioning inserts absorb excess shock in all directions for great stability. Impact Guidance System (IGS(R)) slows pronation for an optimal gait and natural foot movement from heel strike through toe-off. Nylon plates offer tosional rigidity and support. Heel Clutching System(TM) exoskeletal heel counters provide improved support and heel fit. High-performance blown rubber outsoles have abrasion-resistant material in the heels; forefoot material cushions and boosts traction. Vertical flex groove in outsoles follows the line of progression throughout the gait cycle to enhance gait efficiency.
