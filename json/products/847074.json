{"sku":"847074","manufacturer_id":"00.7018.011.001","brand_name":"Sram","product_name":" SRAM X0 10-Speed Grip Shifters - Double / Triple","long_description":"SRAM X0 10-speed grip shifters deliver simple, fast shifts with a flick of a wrist, all with a low-profile, lightweight and tough design that'll be at home on any trail. All-metal indexing delivers precise shifts with positive feel; shifter rotates on 3 rows of ball bearings for smooth action with minimal effort as well as excellent longevity. Twist design enables the full range of up/down shifts so you can jump a bunch of gears in one go (instead of one-at-a-time with trigger setups). Also, the design provides a low-profile look with plenty of clearance for brake and/or handlebar remote levers. Exact Actuation design takes the 1:1 actuation ratio of cable travel/derailleur movement and optimizes it for easy, dependable setup and 10-speed application. Includes an integrated lock-on grip system, which can be converted to work with other lock-on grips. Choose between either 2x or 3x 10-speed drivetrains; compatible with all SRAM 2x or 3x 10-speed Exact Actuation derailleurs. The X0 10-Speed Grip Shifters are sold as a set (front and rear shifters) and come with cables and housing.","short_description":"SRAM X0 10-speed grip shifters deliver simple, fast shifts with a flick of a wrist, all with a low-profile, lightweight and tough design that'll be at home on any trail.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Components","product_group":"Drivetrain Components","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s390227.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l390227.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=390227&tt=df","retail_price":"229.00","sale_price":"229.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=390227\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m390227.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=847074&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8470740002":{"sku":"8470740002","vendor_sku":"00.7018.011.001","upc":"710845697029","size":"3 X 10S","retail_price":"229.00","sale_price":"229.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-components","drivetrain-components"]}
