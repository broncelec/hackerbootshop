Pinnacle-series hard-anodized aluminum pots and frypan distribute heat evenly for efficient cooking; Teflon(R) Radiance technology offers supreme scratch resistance.

BPA-free Infinity plastic mugs nest securely inside Infinity bowls, which in turn nest within the 2-liter pot; 4 plates nest within the 3-liter pot. Color-coded mugs, bowls and plates help you keep track of which set is yours. Infinity polypropylene has a high melting temperature, offers good impact resistance, won't retain odors and is dishwasher safe. EVA foam sleeves keep your beverages hot while the dual-port Sip-It tops help prevent spills; compact mug shape is comfortable for both left- and right-hand use. Included folding pot gripper locks to and removes easily from exterior brackets on the pots and frypan; gripper design prevents scratching of the nonstick surfaces. GSI Pinnacle Camper cookset includes a welded sink basin that doubles as a carry bag.","short_description":"The GSI Pinnacle Camper cookset sets you up with the gear you need to accommodate 4 hungry hikers.
