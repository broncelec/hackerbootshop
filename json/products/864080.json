{"sku":"864080","manufacturer_id":"21920-6210","brand_name":"Marmot","product_name":" Marmot Never Summer Sleeping Bag","long_description":"The Marmot Never Summer Sleeping Bag's treated down insulation delivers solid performance in a lightweight, durable design. It's a great year-round bag that can handle single-digit winter nights. With a European Norm (EN) lower-limit rating of 3degF, the Never Summer sleeping bag is suitable for fall, winter and spring use. 650-fill-power duck down insulation is protected by a durable nylon shell with a water-repellent finish. Down is treated to resist moisture to maintain warmth in damp weather; treated down stays drier 10x longer, maintains 150% more loft and dries 30% faster than untreated down. Nautilus 5-baffle hood envelops your head in warmth; face muff allows hood to be cinched snug without chafing your face. No more midnight drawcord fumbling-smooth, flat upper cord and hard, round lower cord make hood adjustments easy. Stretch tricot baffles provide strength and durability for long bag life. Trapezoidal footbox allows down to loft fully around your feet for optimum warmth and comfort; pocket in the footbox lets you slip in a hand warmer (sold separately). Stash pocket on the top chest near hood stows nighttime essentials. Ground-level side seams keep warm air from escaping. Heat bump draft tube backing full-length, snag-free zipper prevents cold air from seeping through; down-filled collar adds warmth. Locking, 2-way zipper prevents bag from inadvertently opening during the night. Marmot Never Summer Sleeping Bag includes stuff sack and large storage bag. European Norm (EN) is an independent third-party temperature rating, allowing accurate comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags.","short_description":"The Marmot Never Summer Sleeping Bag's treated down insulation delivers solid performance in a lightweight, durable design.
