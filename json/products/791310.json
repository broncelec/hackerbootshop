{"sku":"791310","manufacturer_id":"FLSHJAVA","brand_name":"Jetboil","product_name":" Jetboil Flash Java Kit","long_description":"The Jetboil Flash Java kit gives you everything you need to enjoy a hot cup of fresh coffee from your backcountry campsite. Kit includes Jetboil Flash burner, FluxRing(R) cooking cup, lid, insulated bottom cover/measuring cup, coffee press, coffee sample pack and a tripod base. Innovative thermochromic temperature indicator is integrated into the 3 stripes on the colorful neoprene cozy to show you when the cup contents are hot. When the indicator starts to turn orange you know your water is getting warm and will be boiling before long. Flash features a translucent drink-though lid that lets you check on the contents of the cup so you'll know precisely when your water begins to boil; lid is BPA free. Coffee press works just like a French press in your Jetboil cup; stows inside Jetboil cup so it won't take up any space in your pack. Enjoy the deep, rich and full-bodied flavor of the included sample pack of Fair Trade Organic House Blend coffee from Green Mountain Coffee. Translucent measuring cup with easy-to-read lines unsnaps from the bottom of the cooking cup, providing a convenient tool for preparing meals and hot drinks. Same as the original Jetboil Personal Cooking system, the Flash integrates the personal cooking cup and stove for fast setup and compact storage. FluxRing(R) heat exchanger on the bottom of the cooking cup creates excellent fuel efficiency. Adjustable-flame burner is housed in a windscreen, reducing heat loss when a breeze picks up. Stove burner and cooking cup twist together to create a single convenient system for cooking; disconnect the stove burner and cooking cup for storage. Stove burner and 110g fuel canister (sold separately) stow inside the cup; lid snaps shut for storage. Neoprene cozy on the cooking cup stays in place during cooking without melting, thereby increasing heat retention and efficiency.","short_description":"The Jetboil Flash Java kit gives you everything you need to enjoy a hot cup of fresh coffee from your backcountry campsite.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Camp Kitchen","product_group":"Stoves","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s416475.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l416475.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=416475&tt=df","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=416475\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m416475.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=791310&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7913100002":{"sku":"7913100002","vendor_sku":"FLSHJAVA","upc":"894383000786","color":"TOMATO","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","camp-kitchen","stoves"]}
