{"sku":"767989","manufacturer_id":"8004042","brand_name":"Yakima","product_name":"Yakima BowDown Kayak Rack","long_description":"Taking J-cradles to the next level, the Yakima BowDown has all the features you've been looking for in a kayak rack! Cradle arms fold down when not in use-now you don't have to worry about parking garages with limited clearance. Accommodates most hull shapes; cradles and protects your kayak with soft pads. Because kayak is propped up on its side, it leaves more space on your crossbars for other gear. Universal mounting hardware fits round, square and most factory bars. Includes heavy-duty straps with padded buckles for secure transport; also includes bow and stern tie-down straps. Locks to crossbar with SKS lock core system (sold separately).","short_description":"Taking J-cradles to the next level, the Yakima BowDown has all the features you've been looking for in a kayak rack!","category":"Car Racks","subcategory":"Watercraft Racks","product_group":"Kayak Racks","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s383899.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l383899.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=383899&tt=df","retail_price":"199.00","sale_price":"199.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=383899\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m383899.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=767989&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7679890017":{"sku":"7679890017","vendor_sku":"8004042","upc":"736745040420","retail_price":"199.00","sale_price":"199.00"}},"categories":["car-racks","watercraft-racks","kayak-racks"]}
