The relaxed and upright pedaling position lets you stay comfortable and allows you to go just 1 more mile. And then another .... Flat Foot Technology(TM) geometry places rider upright for comfortable, heads-up positioning; aft positioning allows a rider to place both feet on the ground at a stop. The result is a low center of gravity, full leg extension and increased comfort-somewhat similar to the recumbent bike at a gym. Shimano Revo twist shifter and rear derailleur provide smooth shifting through the 7 gears. Linear-pull brakes provide controlled deceleration for easy stopping. Semi-slick 26x2.0 tires ensure a smooth and stable ride over a variety of road or gravel surfaces. Platform pedals deliver total convenience-no special shoes required. Ergonomic saddle offers a comfortable, shock-absorbent ride. Extras include a full-length chainguard, kickstand and internal cable routing. 1 size fits most.
