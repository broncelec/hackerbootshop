{"sku":"858705","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":"REI Kimtah Rain Jacket - Men's","long_description":"Thanks to eVent(R) fabric technology, the men's REI Kimtah Jacket helps backpackers stay dry and comfortable when they get caught out in a spring or summer rain squall. Waterproof/breathable eVent(R) fabric's unique membrane allows sweat vapor to easily pass through; so you can go all out, yet stay dry and enjoy chill-free rest stops. Fabric is also windproof to 60+ mph. Lightweight nylon fabric makes the jacket easy to pack and well suited to spring and summer temperatures. Pit zips provide additional ventilation when you're at peak exertion levels. Tricot lining in the torso helps the jacket slip easily over other layers; soft brushed tricot lines the collar for added comfort. Adjustable brimmed hood features easy-to-use ripcord-style cinches; hem has an adjustable drawcord. Jacket's front zipper has a stormflap and a chin guard. Cuffs have adjustment tabs; angled cuffs extend coverage over the backs of the hands. Zippered hand pockets are placed for easy access with a pack on; mesh lining and long zippers boost breathability. Jacket also includes a zippered chest pocket and an inner pocket with a cord port. For added protection, exterior zippers are water resistant. The men's REI Kimtah Jacket has an active fit that provides for a full range of motion.","short_description":"Thanks to eVent(R) fabric technology, the men's REI Kimtah Jacket helps backpackers stay dry and comfortable when they get caught out in a spring or summer rain squall.","category":"Men's","subcategory":"Men's Jackets","product_group":"Men's Rain Jackets","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s357695.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l357695.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=357695&tt=df","keywords":"rain,windproof,men's rain jackets,raingear,breathable","retail_price":"239.00","sale_price":"239.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=357695\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m357695.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=858705&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8587050001":{"sku":"8587050001","vendor_sku":"16066","upc":"485870500018","size":"S","color":"DEEP RED","retail_price":"239.00","sale_price":"239.00"},"8587050002":{"sku":"8587050002","vendor_sku":"16066","upc":"485870500025","size":"M","color":"DEEP RED","retail_price":"239.00","sale_price":"239.00"},"8587050003":{"sku":"8587050003","vendor_sku":"16066","upc":"485870500032","size":"L","color":"DEEP RED","retail_price":"239.00","sale_price":"239.00"},"8587050004":{"sku":"8587050004","vendor_sku":"16066","upc":"485870500049","size":"XL","color":"DEEP RED","retail_price":"239.00","sale_price":"239.00"},"8587050005":{"sku":"8587050005","vendor_sku":"16066","upc":"485870500056","size":"XXL","color":"DEEP RED","retail_price":"239.00","sale_price":"239.00"},"8587050006":{"sku":"8587050006","vendor_sku":"16066","upc":"485870500063","size":"S","color":"PUGET SOUND","retail_price":"239.00","sale_price":"239.00"},"8587050007":{"sku":"8587050007","vendor_sku":"16066","upc":"485870500070","size":"M","color":"PUGET SOUND","retail_price":"239.00","sale_price":"239.00"},"8587050008":{"sku":"8587050008","vendor_sku":"16066","upc":"485870500087","size":"L","color":"PUGET SOUND","retail_price":"239.00","sale_price":"239.00"},"8587050009":{"sku":"8587050009","vendor_sku":"16066","upc":"485870500094","size":"XL","color":"PUGET SOUND","retail_price":"239.00","sale_price":"239.00"},"8587050010":{"sku":"8587050010","vendor_sku":"16066","upc":"485870500100","size":"XXL","color":"PUGET SOUND","retail_price":"239.00","sale_price":"239.00"}}}
