At only 1 oz., it's the lightest carabiner Black Diamond makes. Patent-pending, stainless-steel wire hood brings keylock functionality to a wiregate carabiner so it won't snag on slings and bolt hangers. Oz 'biner is the same size and has the same ease of use as the Black Diamond Neutrino carabiner, but it's 8g lighter. Useful in mountaineering or ice climbing applications because the 1-piece gate and spring mechanism won't freeze up. Black Diamond Oz HoodWire carabiner is hot-forged from aluminum for lightweight strength.","short_description":"The best way to lighten your climbing rack is to replace your heavy oval carabiners with airy Black Diamond Oz HoodWire 'biners.
