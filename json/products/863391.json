{"sku":"863391","manufacturer_id":"569","brand_name":"Sea To Summit","product_name":"Sea to Summit Hydraulic Dry Bag with Harness - 35L","long_description":"With enough space for extra layers or gear for day trips, the 35L Sea to Summit Hydraulic dry bag with harness protects gear while you paddle and then makes it easy to haul everything backpack-style. Hydraulic dry bags are designed for heavy use and feature very tough, laminated fabric and welded seams; they also have a high resistance to UV light and cold temperatures. Harness promotes cooling airflow with EVA foam and quick-drying mesh, and it features adjustable back length and a height-adjustable sternum strap to personalize the fit. Removable harness attaches via a series of very tough, corrosion-resistant anodized aluminum buckles; low-profile attachment points reduce snagging when harness is removed. Thermoplastic urethane roll-top closure seals easily and provides reliable waterproof performance. Oval base resists rolling and stays where you put it. Durable attachment points secure dry bag to a pack or kayak. The 35L Sea to Summit Hydraulic dry bag with harness is PVC free.","short_description":"With enough space for extra layers or gear for day trips, the 35L Sea to Summit Hydraulic dry bag with harness protects gear while you paddle and then makes it easy to haul everything backpack-style.","category":"Paddling","subcategory":"Paddling Bags And Cases","product_group":"Dry Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s459623.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l459623.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=459623&tt=df","retail_price":"139.95","sale_price":"139.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=459623\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m459623.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=863391&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8633910004":{"sku":"8633910004","vendor_sku":"569","size":"35 LTR","color":"YELLOW","retail_price":"139.95","sale_price":"139.95"}},"categories":["paddling","paddling-bags-and-cases","dry-bags"]}
