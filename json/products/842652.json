{"sku":"842652","manufacturer_id":"F13D590001","brand_name":"Pieps","product_name":" Pieps iProbe ONE Probe","long_description":"Speed up the fine search for buried victims with the Pieps iProbe ONE probe. It works like a standard avalanche probe with the added feature of being able to detect the signal of a buried transceiver. iProbe One has a built-in receiver in the tip that can detect any brand of avalanche transceiver; probe emits an audible alert when you're close to the victim. When the tip is within 2m the probe emits \"piep, piep\" and when it's within 50cm it emits a continuous \"piiiiiiiep\". If the buried transceiver supports iProbe technology, the transceiver's signal can be temporarily suppressed by the iProbe to make searching for other victims easier. Probe tubes are made of high-quality carbon fiber and aluminum for good strength at a light weight. Centimeter markings help you determine burial depth. Grippy coating ensures you have a good hold on the probe, even when wearing gloves. 1 AA battery (included) powers the Pieps iProbe ONE probe for up to 150 hrs. Includes a storage sack.","short_description":"Speed up the fine search for buried victims with the Pieps iProbe ONE probe.
