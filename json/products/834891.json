{"sku":"834891","manufacturer_id":"14164","brand_name":"Novara","product_name":"Novara Conversion Bike Jacket - Men's","long_description":"From foggy mornings to sunny afternoons, the lightweight, water-resistant and breathable Novara Conversion bike jacket converts to a vest to take changing riding conditions in stride. Polyester microfiber shell is lightweight, water resistant and breathable; windproof to 23 mph. Durable water repellent finish causes water to bead up and roll off, fending off light rain showers and snow. Vented back yoke with mesh panel underneath enhances breathability. Mesh-lined back ensures breathable comfort. Stow detachable sleeves in large zippered back pocket; sleeves detach as 1 piece. Single zippered chest pocket provides easy access and storage of sunglasses and energy gel. Cut long in back for full coverage when you're in the riding position. Reflective piping increases visibility in low light. Seal in warmth with elastic stretch cuffs and 1-hand-adjustable drawcord hem. Polyester brushed tricot collar lies soft next to skin. Front zipper is backed by an internal stormflap to keep cold air from seeping through.","short_description":"From foggy mornings to sunny afternoons, the lightweight, water-resistant and breathable Novara Conversion bike jacket converts to a vest to take changing riding conditions in stride.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Cycling Clothing","product_group":"Cycling Jackets","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s391443.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l391443.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=391443&tt=df","retail_price":"79.50","sale_price":"79.50","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=391443\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m391443.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=834891&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8348910002":{"sku":"8348910002","vendor_sku":"14164","upc":"483489100025","size":"M","color":"SUNBEAM/TIRE GRAY","retail_price":"79.50","sale_price":"79.50"},"8348910003":{"sku":"8348910003","vendor_sku":"14164","upc":"483489100032","size":"L","color":"SUNBEAM/TIRE GRAY","retail_price":"79.50","sale_price":"79.50"},"8348910004":{"sku":"8348910004","vendor_sku":"14164","upc":"483489100049","size":"XL","color":"SUNBEAM/TIRE GRAY","retail_price":"79.50","sale_price":"79.50"},"8348910005":{"sku":"8348910005","vendor_sku":"14164","upc":"483489100056","size":"XXL","color":"SUNBEAM/TIRE GRAY","retail_price":"79.50","sale_price":"79.50"},"8348910008":{"sku":"8348910008","vendor_sku":"14164","upc":"483489100087","size":"L","color":"PUGET SOUND/TIRE GRAY","retail_price":"79.50","sale_price":"79.50"},"8348910009":{"sku":"8348910009","vendor_sku":"14164","upc":"483489100094","size":"XL","color":"PUGET SOUND/TIRE GRAY","retail_price":"79.50","sale_price":"79.50"},"8348910010":{"sku":"8348910010","vendor_sku":"14164","upc":"483489100100","size":"XXL","color":"PUGET SOUND/TIRE GRAY","retail_price":"79.50","sale_price":"79.50"}},"categories":["cycling","cycling-clothing","cycling-jackets"]}
