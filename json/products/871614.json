{"sku":"871614","manufacturer_id":"SLTL","brand_name":"Omega Pacific","product_name":" Omega Pacific Solution Nut Tool","long_description":"The Omega Pacific Solution Nut Tool brings together a number of vital features and has a very thin profile so you can retrieve gear you'd otherwise give up on. Working end of the tool features a dimple to rest against stubborn nuts to pop them loose. There's also a hook for pulling on unreachable cam trigger bars; there's even a little nub that's perfect for pulling on the cavity of a cam's lobe. Opposite end of the tool is flat, instead of rounded, so you can strike frustrating nuts or stoppers. Includes a 0.5 in. wrench for tightening loose bolts. Omega Pacific Solution Nut Tool can also be used to open up a celebratory post-climb beverage.","short_description":"The Omega Pacific Solution Nut Tool brings together a number of vital features and has a very thin profile so you can retrieve gear you'd otherwise give up on.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Protection","product_group":"Climbing Protection Accessories","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s443367.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l443367.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=443367&tt=df","retail_price":"15.95","sale_price":"15.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=443367\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m443367.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=871614&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8716140001":{"sku":"8716140001","vendor_sku":"SLTL","upc":"821273508167","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"15.95","sale_price":"15.95"}},"categories":["climbing","climbing-protection","climbing-protection-accessories"]}
