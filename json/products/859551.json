{"sku":"859551","manufacturer_id":"A130301701162","brand_name":"Line","product_name":"Line Pandora Skis - Women's - 2013/2014","long_description":"When the powder is deep, the women's Line Pandora skis open up a whole new world of backcountry fun with maneuverable rockered tips and tails and 110mm waists that offer high flotation. Tip and tail rocker floats high in backcountry powder whether skiing forward or switch; relatively low rise planes through powder instead of plowing up and over. Jumbo 110mm waists offer massive surface area for excellent flotation. Aspen wood core consists of a blend of high-quality wood laminates that reduce weight and enhance overall strength. Symmetrical flex pattern in the tips and tails allows responsive riding forward or backward. Widest points of the tip and tail are close to the center of the ski, reducing tail drag and hooking in powder. Thin cores and sidewalls in the tips reduce weight and make skis easier to control. P-tex plastic sidewalls isolate vibrations, offering a smooth feel when charging at high speed. The women's Line Pandora skis feature 110mm waists that require bindings with wide brakes. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.","short_description":"When the powder is deep, the women's Line Pandora skis open up a whole new world of backcountry fun with maneuverable rockered tips and tails and 110mm waists that offer high flotation.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382211.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382211.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382211&tt=df","retail_price":"649.95","sale_price":"389.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382211\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382211.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859551&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8595510001":{"sku":"8595510001","vendor_sku":"A130301701162","upc":"886745208150","size":"162 CM","retail_price":"389.93","sale_price":"389.93"},"8595510002":{"sku":"8595510002","vendor_sku":"A130301701172","upc":"886745208174","size":"172 CM","retail_price":"389.93","sale_price":"389.93"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
