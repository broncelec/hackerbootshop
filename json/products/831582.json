{"sku":"831582","manufacturer_id":"10500","brand_name":"Poc","product_name":"POC Trabec Race Bike Helmet","long_description":"Ready for the trails, the POC Trabec Race bike helmet delivers resilient protection, ample airflow and stand-out style for your daily sessions and weekend races. Tough outer shell joins with an internal aramid shell bonded to a shock-absorbent expanded polystyrene layer, all of which produces a helmet of exceptional resiliency. Helmet design aims to protect more of the head, coming down lower on the sides and back to offer more coverage, and, in turn, more protection. 16 vents on the front, top, sides and rear of helmet channel fresh air over your head, helping keep you cool and comfortable. Helmet comes with a removable visor. It's easy to achieve a comfortable fit with the POC Trabec Race bike helmet, thanks to the adjustable straps and rear harness. Comfortable foam padding can be changed to personalize fit and can be removed for cleaning. Please note: while the Trabec Race helmet is designed to withstand multiple impacts, it should be inspected after any crash, using your best judgement for continued use.","short_description":"Ready for the trails, the POC Trabec Race bike helmet delivers resilient protection, ample airflow and stand-out style for your daily sessions and weekend races.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Helmets","product_group":"Mountain Bike Helmets","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s383583.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l383583.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=383583&tt=df","retail_price":"180.00","sale_price":"180.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=383583\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m383583.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=831582&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8315820001":{"sku":"8315820001","vendor_sku":"10500","size":"XS/S","color":"WHITE/ORANGE","retail_price":"180.00","sale_price":"180.00"},"8315820004":{"sku":"8315820004","vendor_sku":"10500","size":"XS/S","color":"ORANGE/WHITE","retail_price":"180.00","sale_price":"180.00"},"8315820006":{"sku":"8315820006","vendor_sku":"10500","size":"XL/XXL","color":"ORANGE/WHITE","retail_price":"180.00","sale_price":"180.00"},"8315820007":{"sku":"8315820007","vendor_sku":"10500","size":"XS/S","color":"BLACK/WHITE","retail_price":"180.00","sale_price":"180.00"},"8315820008":{"sku":"8315820008","vendor_sku":"10500","size":"M/L","color":"BLACK/WHITE","retail_price":"180.00","sale_price":"180.00"},"8315820009":{"sku":"8315820009","vendor_sku":"10500","size":"XL/XXL","color":"BLACK/WHITE","retail_price":"180.00","sale_price":"180.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-helmets","mountain-bike-helmets"]}
