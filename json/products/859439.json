{"sku":"859439","manufacturer_id":"LBC6020","brand_name":"Lange","product_name":" Lange SX 100 Ski Boots - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Combining a soft, intermediate-level flex with roomy footbeds, the Lange SX 120 men's ski boots emphasize comfort as you take on steeper terrain and faster turns. Soft flex index provides a power transfer suited to new intermediate skiers looking to expand their skills. Roomy, 102mm footbeds offer a comfortable fit and can accommodate wide feet. Uniform-density plastic shells ensure highly efficient power transfer, smooth flex and finely-tuned responsiveness, even in frigid temperatures. Shells are designed to create a centered, balanced stance on rockered skis to increase efficiency of technique and reduce fatigue. Liners comfortably contour your feet and precisely match the internal shape of the shell to create instant responsiveness, and they may be custom molded using a heat treatment. 1-piece toe boxes and tongues eliminate seams and overlaps in the tongue attachment area, reducing pressure points at the instep and top of the toes. Specially designed insteps provide an excellent fit at the midfoot, resulting in increased circulation and greater warmth. Saddle-stitched seams help reduce hotspots. Rubber soles of the Lange SX 120 ski boots offer excellent grip.","short_description":"Combining a soft, intermediate-level flex with roomy footbeds, the Lange SX 120 men's ski boots emphasize comfort as you take on steeper terrain and faster turns.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Downhill Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382607.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382607.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382607&tt=df","retail_price":"399.95","sale_price":"399.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382607\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382607.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859439&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8594390001":{"sku":"8594390001","vendor_sku":"LBC6020","size":"Mondo 26.5","color":"RED/BLACK/WHITE","retail_price":"399.95","sale_price":"399.95"},"8594390002":{"sku":"8594390002","vendor_sku":"LBC6020","size":"Mondo 27.5","color":"RED/BLACK/WHITE","retail_price":"399.95","sale_price":"399.95"},"8594390003":{"sku":"8594390003","vendor_sku":"LBC6020","size":"Mondo 28.5","color":"RED/BLACK/WHITE","retail_price":"399.95","sale_price":"399.95"},"8594390004":{"sku":"8594390004","vendor_sku":"LBC6020","size":"Mondo 29.5","color":"RED/BLACK/WHITE","retail_price":"399.95","sale_price":"399.95"}}}
