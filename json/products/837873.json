{"sku":"837873","manufacturer_id":"E78BHB","brand_name":"Petzl","product_name":"Petzl Pixa 2 Pro Headlamp","long_description":"The Petzl Pixa 2 Pro headlamp keeps your hands free for tasks at home and around the campsite. It has 2 modes to meet your distance and close-range lighting needs. Use the light on high to illuminate objects up to 30m away with 40 lumens of light; switch the light to low for proximity lighting that shines 20m and outputs 30 lumens. 2 AA batteries (included) provide up to 6 hrs. of use on high and 12 hrs. of use on low; battery indicator light lets you know when you need new batteries. Regulated output keeps the brightness and distance consistent throughout the life of the batteries. When the batteries are almost dead, the headlamp will continue to shine a 10m beam for 10 hrs. so you can still work until you have a chance to change the batteries. Reliable, strong and durable light is constructed to withstand 2m (6.6 ft.) falls and crushing by weights of up to 80kg (176 lbs.). Can be worn as a standard headlamp or mounted on a helmet with the included plate; compatible with Petzl Vertex (2010 version) and Alveo helmets (not included). Take the back mounting plate off and the light can be placed on any flat surface and aimed up to light up tight spaces. Large on/off and mode-selector dial is easy to manipulate with gloves on. Light body rotates up to 45deg so you can aim the beam right where you need it. Always working in dirty, wet places? Not to worry! Pixa 2 Pro's IP67 rating indicates complete protection against dust and protection against submersion to 1m for 30 min. Battery case is easy to open and close for quick battery changes; compatible with alkaline, NiMH, NiCd and lithium batteries. When storing the light, pivot the body so the LED faces the backing plate to protect the glass from scratches; this position also prevents the light from being turned on. Comfortable headband easily detaches from the Petzl Pixa 2 Pro headlamp when you want to clean the light.","short_description":"The Petzl Pixa 2 Pro headlamp keeps your hands free for tasks at home and around the campsite.
