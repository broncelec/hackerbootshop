{"sku":"855790","manufacturer_id":"05401-033S2","brand_name":"Ruffwear","product_name":" Ruffwear Swamp Cooler Cooling Dog Vest","long_description":"Help your dog keep its cool in the heat with the Ruffwear Swamp Cooler Dog Vest-so it can enjoy being with you hiking a desert canyon or walking a city park on a hot day. The evaporative cooling process is what makes this vest work-simply soak the vest with water, wring it out, strap it on and heat is dissipated as the water evaporates. Wicking mesh layer on top facilitates evaporation and releases heat, middle layer absorbs and stores cooling water, and bottom layer transfers the cool to your dog. Light-colored fabric reflects sunlight and heat to increase cooling efficiency. Ergonomic cut wraps back and chest to offer a comfortable fit that stays in place; quick-release buckles allow an adjustable fit and easy on/off convenience. Attachment loop situated between dog's shoulder blades offers a clip point for a beacon light (light sold separately); reflective trim enhances visibility in low light.","short_description":"Help your dog keep its cool in the heat with the Ruffwear Swamp Cooler Dog Vest-so it can enjoy being with you hiking a desert canyon or walking a city park on a hot day.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Dog Gear","product_group":"Dog Clothes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s417539.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l417539.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=417539&tt=df","keywords":"vest","retail_price":"55.00","sale_price":"55.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=417539\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m417539.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=855790&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8557900001":{"sku":"8557900001","vendor_sku":"05401-033S2","upc":"748960080969","size":"XXS","color":"GRAPHITE GRAY","retail_price":"55.00","sale_price":"55.00"},"8557900002":{"sku":"8557900002","vendor_sku":"05401-033S1","upc":"748960081966","size":"XS","color":"GRAPHITE GRAY","retail_price":"55.00","sale_price":"55.00"},"8557900003":{"sku":"8557900003","vendor_sku":"05401-033S","upc":"748960082963","size":"S","color":"GRAPHITE GRAY","retail_price":"55.00","sale_price":"55.00"},"8557900004":{"sku":"8557900004","vendor_sku":"05401-033M","upc":"748960083960","size":"M","color":"GRAPHITE GRAY","retail_price":"55.00","sale_price":"55.00"},"8557900005":{"sku":"8557900005","vendor_sku":"05401-033L","upc":"748960084967","size":"L","color":"GRAPHITE GRAY","retail_price":"55.00","sale_price":"55.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","dog-gear","dog-clothes"]}
