It's twice the size so adds twice the protection and privacy. The Asym Hex fly works with all Hennessy Hammock models. Use the A-Sym Hex rainfly in different ways: snugged down to the ground on both sides around your hammock or angled to provide a large covered area as a group shelter. Ties directly to trees for easy hanging. Includes neat little storage pockets on the corners for cord stowing. Use for group camping, car camping or kayak or motorcycle camping where the extra weight is less of a concern.","short_description":"The Hennessy Hammock Asym Hex rainfly can be substituted for the regular rainfly that comes with your Hennessy Hammock.
