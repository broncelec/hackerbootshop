{"sku":"857588","manufacturer_id":"BUS05428","brand_name":"Novara","product_name":" Novara Carema Pro Women's Bike - 2014","long_description":"Our Novara Carema Pro women's road bike offers swift all-around performance for club rides and tours thanks to a stiff aluminum frame with carbon fork and Shimano 105 drivetrain. Butted aluminum frame features shaped seatstays and top tube for enhanced comfort and performance; tapered head tube improves strength and handling precision. Fork boasts a tapered alloy steerer with a machined, 1-piece alloy crown for strength and stiffness where it counts; carbon legs help damp road vibrations and reduce weight. Carema Pro geometry is optimized to offer a comfortable, women-specific fit. Shimano 105 shifters and derailleurs offer high-end shifting performance and dependability without an astronomical price tag. Compact crankset and wide-ranging 12-30 cassette delivers the gearing versatility of a triple crankset without the weight or finicky shifting. Shimano long-reach caliper brakes are compatible with fenders (not included) and deliver dependable braking power. Sturdy Weinmann rims, Clement Strada LGG tires and dependable Novatech hubs provide sure rolling performance. Eyelets for fenders let you outfit the Carema Pro for wet-weather or commuting performance (fenders not included). Replaceable rear derailleur hanger helps extend the usable life of the frame.
