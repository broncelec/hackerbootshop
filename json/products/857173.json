The Union Contact Pro bindings are built extra strong, damp and light for amazing performance that doesn't restrict your board's natural flex. Contact Pro bases are made wth high-quality DuPont(TM) Zytel(R) ST nylon; they're strong, supportive and secure, and offer balanced comfort and response. The Contact Pro bases only have 5% contact with the board, offering supreme strength with the smallest footprint possible so your board flexes naturally. Extruded aluminum heel cups reduce weight and maintain strength; dual-density EVA bushings offering vibration damping that allows you to feel a natural board flex. Contact Pro highbacks are incredibly lightweight and comfortable; forward lean adjusts on the fly without tools. 3D Direct-Connect ankle straps eliminate elasticity and evenly distribute pressure across feet and ankles for increased comfort and board control. Multi-position toe straps offer an improved and updated fit for a wide range of boots. Magnesium buckles are 4 times stronger than aluminum with only half the weight. Union Contact Pro bindings are compatible with Burton The Channel M6 snowboards.","short_description":"You know if Gigi approves it, it's gotta be good.
