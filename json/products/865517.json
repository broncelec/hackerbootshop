{"sku":"865517","manufacturer_id":"14W350841","brand_name":"Vibram","product_name":"Vibram FiveFingers Bikila Evo Road-Running Shoes - Women's","long_description":"The fully redesigned women's Vibram FiveFinger Bikila Evo Road-Running Shoes are built for runners looking for shoes that give the benefits of going barefoot, but with a bit more cushion and support. With a total sole thickness of 8.5mm, the Bikila shoes are still very thin but have a bit more cushion so you can feel confident using the shoes on medium-distance road runs. Polyester mesh uppers breathe well to keep your feet cool and dry on long runs. Zero drop from heel to toe encourages a natural midfoot or forefoot strike to promote forward momentum and reduce the impact of heel striking. Individual toe slots enhance dexterity, control and stability to deliver a natural running motion; thermoplastic urethane toe bumpers enhance protection. 2mm-thick insoles provide comfort and cushioning underfoot. Quick-lace closure system and locking buckle allow for a comfortable custom fit with just 1 easy pull. Vibram(R) rubber pods on the bottoms add durability and provide great grip. In order to allow your feet to adapt to using different muscles, begin use of these shoes gradually and increase over time. Vibram FiveFingers Bikila Evo Road-Running Shoes are machine washable in cold water; air dry only, away from sun or heat source. To determine size, stand with heels against a wall and measure from the wall to the tip of the longest toe on each foot; use the longer of the 2 lengths with the size chart.","short_description":"The fully redesigned women's Vibram FiveFinger Bikila Evo Road-Running Shoes are built for runners looking for shoes that give the benefits of going barefoot, but with a bit more cushion and support.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Women's Footwear","product_group":"Women's Shoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s443179.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l443179.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=443179&tt=df","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=443179\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m443179.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=865517&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8655170001":{"sku":"8655170001","vendor_sku":"14W350536","upc":"847100041195","size":"36","color":"BLACK/YELLOW/MAGENTA","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8655170002":{"sku":"8655170002","vendor_sku":"14W350537","upc":"847100041201","size":"37","color":"BLACK/YELLOW/MAGENTA","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8655170003":{"sku":"8655170003","vendor_sku":"14W350538","upc":"847100041218","size":"38","color":"BLACK/YELLOW/MAGENTA","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8655170004":{"sku":"8655170004","vendor_sku":"14W350539","upc":"847100041225","size":"39","color":"BLACK/YELLOW/MAGENTA","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8655170006":{"sku":"8655170006","vendor_sku":"14W350541","upc":"847100041249","size":"41","color":"BLACK/YELLOW/MAGENTA","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8655170007":{"sku":"8655170007","vendor_sku":"14W350542","upc":"847100041256","size":"42","color":"BLACK/YELLOW/MAGENTA","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8655170010":{"sku":"8655170010","vendor_sku":"14W350838","upc":"847100041553","size":"38","color":"BLUE/GREEN","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8655170011":{"sku":"8655170011","vendor_sku":"14W350839","upc":"847100041577","size":"39","color":"BLUE/GREEN","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8655170012":{"sku":"8655170012","vendor_sku":"14W350840","upc":"847100041607","size":"40","color":"BLUE/GREEN","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"},"8655170013":{"sku":"8655170013","vendor_sku":"14W350841","upc":"847100041638","size":"41","color":"BLUE/GREEN","retail_price":"120.00","sale_price":"120.00"}},"categories":["footwear","womens-footwear","womens-shoes"]}
