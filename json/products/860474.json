{"sku":"860474","manufacturer_id":"7629N1.LW","brand_name":"Marker","product_name":" Marker Lord S.P. Downhill Ski Bindings","long_description":"High-performance bindings for those who use AT boots at the resort, the Marker Lord S.P. bindings can accommodate both alpine and A.T. soles using a unique pin system. Pin system allows the toe to be set in either of two distinct positions, then the fine adjustment can be made via the AFD height adjustment screw. The stand height of the Lord is also much lower than most AT bindings, increasing power transfer to skis. DIN settings from 5 - 14 offer high performance for advanced skiers. Lightweight and strong magnesium parts and wide toe baseplates increase durability and control of wide-waisted skis. Triple Pivot Elite toes absorb high levels of energy to help prevent prerelease, and updated horizontal torsion bar reinforcements enhance power and lateral precision. Lightweight Inter-Pivot heels focus power in the direction of the boot soles and offer superior holding power and energy transfer. Stainless-steel antifriction devices allow essential lateral boot movement despite dirty or worn soles or negative sliding friction. 110mm brakes fit all-mountain wide skis and some powder skis; mounting configuration of the Marker Lord S.P. downhill ski bindings requires a 78mm minimum ski width.","short_description":"High-performance bindings for those who use AT boots at the resort, the Marker Lord S.P. bindings can accommodate both alpine and A.T. soles using a unique pin system.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Bindings","product_group":"Downhill Ski Bindings","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s381615.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l381615.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=381615&tt=df","retail_price":"379.00","sale_price":"379.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=381615\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m381615.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=860474&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8604740001":{"sku":"8604740001","vendor_sku":"7629N1.LW","upc":"883295104055","size":"110 MM","color":"BLACK/WHITE/RED","retail_price":"379.00","sale_price":"379.00"}},"categories":["snow","ski-bindings","downhill-ski-bindings"]}
