{"sku":"854699","brand_name":"Patagonia","product_name":"Patagonia Rubicon Insulated Pants - Women's","long_description":"The women's Patagonia Rubicon insulated pants deliver waterproof protection for all conditions, and strategically placed insulation to keep you dry and warm as you charge up and down the mountain. Rugged, 2-layer recycled polyester shell is backed with a waterproof, breathable H2No(R) laminate to deliver all-weather protection. Durable Water Repellent finish causes water to bead up and roll off, fending off melting snow to help keep you dry. Synthetic insulation, 90% of which is recycled material, is placed in critical areas to provide insulating warmth, even if it gets damp; it also compresses for compact stowing. Embedded RECCO(R) reflector enhances radio signals from search-and-rescue RECCO detectors, helping speed up the search for a buried avalanche victim. Polyester lining helps move sweat away from your body and glides smoothly over base layers; mesh-backed thigh vents let you release excess body heat while keeping snow out. Brushed lining on waistband wicks sweat and provides against-the-skin comfort; zip-fly, 2-snap closure and adjustable waistband tabs provide a personalized fit. Snow gaiters securely wrap around boots to keep snow from entering pants; scuff guards protect cuffs from abrasion and sharp edges. Patagonia Rubicon insulated pants have zippered handwarmer pockets, zippered back pockets and a thigh cargo pocket.","short_description":"The women's Patagonia Rubicon insulated pants deliver waterproof protection for all conditions, and strategically placed insulation to keep you dry and warm as you charge up and down the mountain.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Women's Ski Clothing","product_group":"Women's Ski Pants","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s338839.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l338839.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=338839&tt=df","keywords":"snowpant,snow pants,pants,pant,hardshell pants","retail_price":"249.00","sale_price":"249.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=338839\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m338839.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=854699&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8546990001":{"sku":"8546990001","vendor_sku":"30675","upc":"887187119912","size":"XS","color":"PRAIRIE GOLD","retail_price":"249.00","sale_price":"249.00"},"8546990002":{"sku":"8546990002","vendor_sku":"30675","upc":"887187119929","size":"S","color":"PRAIRIE GOLD","retail_price":"249.00","sale_price":"249.00"},"8546990003":{"sku":"8546990003","vendor_sku":"30675","upc":"887187119943","size":"M","color":"PRAIRIE GOLD","retail_price":"249.00","sale_price":"249.00"},"8546990006":{"sku":"8546990006","vendor_sku":"30675","upc":"887187119264","size":"S","color":"GRAPHITE NAVY","retail_price":"249.00","sale_price":"249.00"},"8546990007":{"sku":"8546990007","vendor_sku":"30675","upc":"887187119271","size":"M","color":"GRAPHITE NAVY","retail_price":"249.00","sale_price":"249.00"},"8546990008":{"sku":"8546990008","vendor_sku":"30675","upc":"887187119288","size":"L","color":"GRAPHITE NAVY","retail_price":"249.00","sale_price":"249.00"}}}
