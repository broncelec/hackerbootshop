{"sku":"865708","manufacturer_id":"234196-008","brand_name":"Scott","product_name":"Scott Contessa Scale 720 27.5 Women's Bike - 2014","long_description":"The Scott Contessa Scale 720 27.5 women's mountain bike offers reliable trail performance with its nimble 27.5 in. wheels, 30 gears for any terrain and a 100mm-travel fork for big bumps. The Contessa Scale 720 27.5 bike is quicker and lighter than 29ers, but offers the same benefits of large-diameter wheels-more speed and better traction. Compared to 26 in. wheels, larger-diameter wheels roll over obstacles more easily so you won't stall going uphill over roots and loose soil. Aluminum frame geometry is designed specifically for women, creating a more comfortable ride compared to unisex frames. Suntour XCR-RL suspension fork has 100mm of travel; suspension can be locked out when not needed. Shimano Deore shifters and front derailleur and Deore Shadow rear derailleur offer fast and reliable shifting performance across the 30 gears. Shimano hydraulic disc brakes provide easy, progressive braking with a 180mm rotor up front and a 160mm rotor in the back. Sturdy rims are outfitted with Impac Ridgepac tires for all-terrain handling and traction. Full-length cable housing deters gunky buildup that saps shifting performance; replaceable rear derailleur hanger helps extend the frame's usable lifespan.
