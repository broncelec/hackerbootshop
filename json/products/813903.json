{"sku":"813903","manufacturer_id":"RX-922LSE","brand_name":"Serfas","product_name":" Serfas RX Saddle - Women's","long_description":"Serfas RX saddle for women is medically tested and proven to reduce cycling-related discomfort and numbness. A groove from tip to tail shifts rider's weight to inner thighs and buttocks, avoiding contact with the perineum, relieving pelvic discomfort. Also, the majority of rider weight is placed on the rear of the saddle, further reducing pressure against the perineal artery. Patented dual-density technology uses molded rubber inserts on base for shock absorption and an extra layer of Reactive Gel for added comfort. Hard frame provides excellent support and allows for increased ventilation. Compared to the men's RX saddle, the women's RX saddle design incorporates a wider back to accommodate wider pelvic bones and a slightly shorter nose.","short_description":"Serfas RX saddle for women is medically tested and proven to reduce cycling-related discomfort and numbness.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Components","product_group":"Bike Saddles And Seatposts","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s388887.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l388887.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=388887&tt=df","retail_price":"55.95","sale_price":"55.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=388887\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m388887.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=813903&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8139030001":{"sku":"8139030001","vendor_sku":"RX-922LSE","upc":"713835015940","retail_price":"55.95","sale_price":"55.95"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-components","bike-saddles-and-seatposts"]}
