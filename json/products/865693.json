{"sku":"865693","manufacturer_id":"CPD130INRE","brand_name":"Nemo","product_name":"NEMO Astro Insulated Sleeping Pad","long_description":"Forget the typical 1 in. thick backcountry pad and trade up for the NEMO Astro(TM) Insulated Sleeping Pad. It has 3 in. of insulated comfort that practically disappears into your pack. A layer of PrimaLoft(R) provides even and consistent insulation to keep you warm even when the ground is cold. I-beam baffle construction provides a flat pad surface and minimizes any bouncy feel when inflated. 3 in. thick lateral baffles are plush and tend to support body contours better than vertical baffles because the pad resists folding around the body's longitudinal axis. The pillow baffle at the head end is oversized to provide extra loft under your head and prevents your camp pillow from sliding off the end of the pad. Durable 75-denier polyester fabric is laminated with a polymer film that keeps the fabric airtight and creates strong welds. Inflation/deflation valve has 2 positions: pull out to inflate or push in to prevent air from escaping while you take your next breath; push all the way in and twist to close. The NEMO Astro(TM) Insulated Sleeping Pad includes a stuff sack, compression strap and repair kit.","short_description":"Forget the typical 1 in. thick backcountry pad and trade up for the NEMO Astro(TM) Insulated Sleeping Pad.
