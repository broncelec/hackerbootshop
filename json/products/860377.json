{"sku":"860377","manufacturer_id":"U130100301300","brand_name":"Atlas","product_name":"Atlas 1230 Snowshoes","long_description":"With aggressive traction, the Atlas 1230 snowshoes can handle anything you find between the trailhead and summit. Long-lasting durability and a secure fit make these snowshoes that you can depend on. Tenacious, stainless-steel toe crampons deeply penetrate the firmest snow and bite into icy slopes. Stainless-steel serrated heel cleats and side traction rails provide sure footing while traversing and descending the most technical terrain. Wrapp(TM) Pro bindings feature silicone straps that glide through low-friction buckles with a smooth buckle release for easy on/off use. 7075 V-shaped aluminum frames are the lightest and strongest Atlas offers, and have a stiff, responsive flex for smooth, easy striding. Spring-Loaded(TM) suspension uses offset webbing straps to create a springy platform beneath the feet that absorbs impact and allows natural side-to-side flex. Lightweight Duratek(TM) nylon decks are tough and built to withstand harsh, cold conditions; textured surfaces resist abrasion. Heel lift bars on the Atlas 1230 snowshoes relieve calf muscle fatigue while climbing; bars store flat when disengaged. Snowshoes measure 9.25 x 30 in. and have a recommended load weight of 150 to 250 lbs.","short_description":"With aggressive traction, the Atlas 1230 snowshoes can handle anything you find between the trailhead and summit.
