{"sku":"852955","manufacturer_id":"WZ1-SUPC-1","brand_name":"Wheeleez","product_name":"Wheeleez Stand Up Paddleboard Cart - Single","long_description":"The Wheeleez SUP cart safely transports your stand up paddleboard and paddle to the water using tough construction and an easy-to-load design. Set SUP into foam cradles so that the mid-point of the board is even with the upright tubes, secure paddle and SUP with the included straps, and handle by lifting nose or tail. 10 in. tires cruise easily over firm beach terrain and detach quickly with cotter pins. Foam-filled tires offer high durability and will not go flat. Durable, corrosion-resistant aluminum frame collapses like a pair of scissors and takes up little storage space. Stainless-steel hardware and axle resist corrosion from use in salt water. Foam padding carefully cradles your SUP. Comes with two 9.8 ft. tie-down straps to secure SUP and paddle. The Wheeleez SUP cart is an excellent choice for firm terrain such as asphalt, boat launches and packed sand. If transporting over sandy, soggy, or grassy terrain, Wheeleez recommends using the Wheeleez balloon wheels (not included).","short_description":"The Wheeleez SUP cart safely transports your stand up paddleboard and paddle to the water using tough construction and an easy-to-load design.","category":"Paddling","subcategory":"Paddleboarding","product_group":"Paddleboard Accessories","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s442359.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l442359.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=442359&tt=df","retail_price":"139.00","sale_price":"139.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=442359\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m442359.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=852955&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8529550001":{"sku":"8529550001","vendor_sku":"WZ1-SUPC-1","upc":"485295500013","retail_price":"139.00","sale_price":"139.00"}},"categories":["paddling","paddleboarding","paddleboard-accessories"]}
