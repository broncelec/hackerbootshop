Hyper Progressive sidecut mellows out the transitions, leaving you with a predictable, all-around board; you can make ultrafine adjustments at any speed and in all conditions. Hybritech construction minimizes the overall amount of materials used to unleash lightweight precision, powerful response and buttery-smooth performance.
