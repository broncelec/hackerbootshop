Magnetron Technology uses a steel insert in the nose of the carabiner and 2 magnetic arms in the gate for a super-secure, super-fast and easy-to-use locking mechanism. Gate can be opened with 1 hand. Key lock nose won't snag on pro, ropes or slings, making the 'biner simple to clip. Pear shape increases friction up to 30% over a non-pear-shaped 'biner when lowering or rappelling with a Black Diamond ATC Belay Device (sold separately). Magnetron VaporLock Locking Carabiner from Black Diamond is munter hitch compatible on ropes up to 9.4 mm.","short_description":"Black Diamond's lightest pear-shaped locking 'biner, outfitted with innovative Magnetron Technology, the Magnetron VaporLock Locking Carabiner is the ultimate lightweight locker for long free climbs.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Hardware","product_group":"Carabiners","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s451311.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l451311.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=451311&tt=df","retail_price":"27.95","sale_price":"27.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=451311\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m451311.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=867069&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8670690001":{"sku":"8670690001","vendor_sku":"BD2102890000ALL","upc":"793661198987","color":"LIME","retail_price":"27.95","sale_price":"27.95"}},"categories":["climbing","climbing-hardware","carabiners"]}
