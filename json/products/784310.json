Covers national, state and local parks, national and state forests, and national and state wilderness areas. Also features interstates, major highways, rural roads, trails, city neighborhood roads, railroads, power lines, borders and more. Searchable database of cities, geographic names, summits, lakes and other points of interest makes locating a special spot quick and easy. Summit locations feature elevation information, handy for calibrating altimeters. Topographic contours with shading enhance relief viewing; elevation profile displays on PC and some compatible units to estimate terrain difficulty. 24K Topo ships on a 4GB Micro SD card; older GPS devices may require a firmware update in order to read a 4GB and larger card.
