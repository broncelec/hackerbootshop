{"sku":"822577","manufacturer_id":"126538","brand_name":"Salomon","product_name":"Salomon Active 8 Skate Boots - Men's","long_description":"The sporty Salomon Active 8 skate boots offer lots of performance for dedicated skiers who want to have fun and get in a great workout. SNS(R) Pilot(R)2 Equipe outsoles feature 2 connection points with the SNS Pilot skate bindings (sold separately) for excellent stability and control while skiing. Front connection points are placed 10mm back from the front of the boots for a natural kick and good energy transfer. Supportive Energyzer cuffs enhance lateral support and help position your lower legs properly before and after kick. Proper leg positioning allows your lower legs and feet to relax, reducing leg and foot fatigue while also lifting the tips of the skis for less drag and quick ski return. Rip-and-stick ankle straps let you adjust cuff tension for desired support. Salomon Quicklace Kevlar(R) laces pull snug with a single tug. Lace covers feature soft-shell material and diagonal zippers to keep snow and ice out. Salomon Sport Fit features a 102mm forefoot width and medium volume for great foothold, comfort and fit. Salomon Active 8 skate boots are compatible with SNS Pilot bindings.","short_description":"The sporty Salomon Active 8 skate boots offer lots of performance for dedicated skiers who want to have fun and get in a great workout.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Cross-Country Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s450615.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l450615.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=450615&tt=df","retail_price":"229.95","sale_price":"183.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=450615\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m450615.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=822577&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8225770001":{"sku":"8225770001","vendor_sku":"126538","upc":"080694343447","size":"8 UK","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"183.93","sale_price":"183.93"},"8225770002":{"sku":"8225770002","vendor_sku":"126538","upc":"080694394753","size":"8.5 UK","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"183.93","sale_price":"183.93"}},"categories":["snow","ski-boots","crosscountry-ski-boots"]}
