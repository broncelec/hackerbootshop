The Granite Gear Blaze A.C. 60 Ki pack is made of 100-denier ripstop and 210-denier Cordura(R) nylon for durability and light weight.","short_description":"The Granite Gear Blaze A.C. 60 Ki pack for women combines Spartan simplicity with a well-engineered suspension and 40 lb. capacity for the ultimate in lightness, comfort and ease of use.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Backpacks","product_group":"Backpacking Packs","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s410463.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l410463.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=410463&tt=df","keywords":"multiday","retail_price":"239.95","sale_price":"239.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=410463\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m410463.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=824384&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8243840001":{"sku":"8243840001","vendor_sku":"532561","upc":"782922532561","size":"Short","color":"TIGER/JAVA","retail_price":"239.95","sale_price":"239.95"},"8243840002":{"sku":"8243840002","vendor_sku":"532660","upc":"782922532660","size":"Regular","color":"TIGER/JAVA","retail_price":"239.95","sale_price":"239.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","backpacks","backpacking-packs"]}
