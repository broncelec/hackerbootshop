Rockered profile means catch-free fun no matter where you ride. V-Rocker-center rocker with additional rockers in front of your feet-ups edge control underfoot while disengaging tip and tail contact points for a catch-free feel. For as loose and skatelike as they feel, V-Rocker boards turn on a dime thanks to the added grip of specially tuned edges underfoot that dig into hardpack. The Channel system offers unlimited, on-the-fly stance adjustability and enhances board feel; compatible with EST(TM), Re:Flex(TM) and Disc(R) bindings. The Channel lets you fine-tune your stance width to the millimeter, and then dial in your toe-to-heel centering and rotate your angles in one fell swoop. Directional shape concentrates pop in the tail and offers plenty of overall float and control; twin flex makes riding regular or switch simple. Tip-to-tail wood core is durable and provides a forgiving flex for edge control and solid turns; edges are tuned to slice and dice the entire mountain. Biax(TM) React fiberglass construction provides torsional forgiveness, board feel and edge hold, perfect for advancing to the next level. Easy-to-maintain extruded base enhances speed and durability to keep you moving fast in all snow conditions. Catch-free edge tune gives entry-level to intermediate riders a progression-tuned platform to learn and improve on; you'll cruise with more control. .","short_description":"Perfect for new and progressing snowboarders, the Burton Clash snowboard gets you on the hill without costing you a fortune.
