{"sku":"847526","manufacturer_id":"00601613RR","brand_name":"Sierra Designs","product_name":" Sierra Designs Eleanor 24 Sleeping Bag - Women's","long_description":"Stuffed with 700-fill DriDown(TM) insulation, the women's Sierra Designs Eleanor 24 sleeping bag will keep you toasty on cold-weather camping trips. Down is widely considered the best insulation available, but when wet it quickly loses loft and the ability to keep you warm; DriDown is treated to resist moisture. Proprietary process treats each individual goose down plume with a molecular-level polymer so the down stays dry longer, lofts better and dries faster than untreated down. DriDown insulation stays dry 10 times longer, retains 170% more loft when exposed to moisture and dries 33% faster than untreated down. Women-specific bags are cut to match a woman's shape, and provide extra insulation and warmth in the hood and feet areas. Lightweight yet durable 30-denier micro-ripstop polyester shell and comfortable, moisture-wicking polyester lining warm up fast. Baffle construction keeps down from migrating, eliminating cold spots. Full-length 2-way, double sliding zipper allows easy venting; locking slider is backed by wide, antisnag binding tape. Snag-free zipper tracks prevent the dreaded stuck zipper by creating a barrier between the lining and the zipper track. Fully insulated draft tube backing the zipper keeps body heat in and cold air out. Ergonomic, nonrestrictive hood cradles your head in warmth; hood features differentiated drawcords that make fit adjustments easy, even in the dark. Roomy, ergonomically shaped footbox enhances comfort and warmth of feet. Sierra Designs Eleanor 24 comes with stuff sack and storage bag. European Norm (EN) is an independent third-party temperature rating, allowing accurate comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags.","short_description":"Stuffed with 700-fill DriDown(TM) insulation, the women's Sierra Designs Eleanor 24 sleeping bag will keep you toasty on cold-weather camping trips.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags And Accessories","product_group":"Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s421419.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l421419.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=421419&tt=df","keywords":"compact","retail_price":"279.95","sale_price":"279.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=421419\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m421419.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=847526&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8475260001":{"sku":"8475260001","vendor_sku":"00601613RR","upc":"054003729253","size":"Regular Right","color":"SCUBA","retail_price":"279.95","sale_price":"279.95"}}}
