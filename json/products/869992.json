{"sku":"869992","manufacturer_id":"00.1918.035.010","brand_name":"Zipp","product_name":" Zipp 303 Firecrest Carbon Clincher Disc Wheel - Front","long_description":"A light and tough carbon wheel that's compatible with disc brakes, the Zipp 303 Firecrest Carbon Clincher front wheel delivers podium-level performance and weighs in at 780g. Ultralight carbon rim uses Firecrest(R) shaping to optimize the aerodynamic profile of both the front and back halves of the wheel. This rim shape also offers incredible crosswind stability, performing closer to a box-section rim despite the 45mm deep profile; dimpled surface dramatically reduces drag. Wider rim profile increases side-to-side stiffness for responsive sprinting and cornering; also offers great control, comfort, and strength. Zipp 188 hub uses Swiss-made cartridge bearings with extremely smooth-rolling grade 10 steel balls. Oversize 17mm diameter axle delivers significant stiffness for minimal deflection and precise response to input; axle spacing is 100mm. The Zipp 303 Firecrest Carbon Clincher Disc Front Wheel has a maximum tire pressure of 125 psi (8.62 bar). Please note: this wheel is clincher-compatible only and comes with a quick-release skewer, rim tape, valve extender and Tangente butyl tube. Zipp recommends a maximum weight of 250 lbs. (113kg), including rider, bike and gear.","short_description":"A light and tough carbon wheel that's compatible with disc brakes, the Zipp 303 Firecrest Carbon Clincher front wheel delivers podium-level performance and weighs in at 780g.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Components","product_group":"Bike Tires, Tubes And Wheels","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s457299.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l457299.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=457299&tt=df","retail_price":"1272.00","sale_price":"1272.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=457299\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m457299.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=869992&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8699920001":{"sku":"8699920001","vendor_sku":"00.1918.035.010","upc":"710845727658","size":"700C","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"1272.00","sale_price":"1272.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-components","bike-tires-tubes-and-wheels"]}
