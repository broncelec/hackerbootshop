{"sku":"866944","manufacturer_id":"S4BRAMXBR","brand_name":"Ticla","product_name":"Ticla Rambler Sleeping Bag","long_description":"If it's looking a little too chilly for your go-to summer bag, the luxe Ticla Rambler Sleeping Bag has just the right amount of extra insulation to keep you warm on 3-season car-camping trips. Flip it! It it's balmy out, sleep with the warmer side of the Rambler sleeping bag down; when there's a nip to the air, flip it over for a little extra insulation. Rambler bag has hollow-core synthetic insulation that is rated to keep you warm down to about 15degF with the warmer side up and 25degF with the warmer side down. Soft polyester lining feels great next to skin; tapered shape keeps your feet warm without restricting them. 2-way zipper lets your feet be free and get some air; unzip the bag all the way for use as a comforter. Packs up without a fuss using the roomy Get Out Of Dodge (G.O.O.D.) System storage bag. G.O.O.D. bag is designed to hold a slightly deflated Tsubo sleeping pad (sold separately) around a loosely stuffed Rambler bag, with room for your pillow, headlamp and book. Ticla Rambler Sleeping Bag also comes with a sleeping bag stuff sack.","short_description":"If it's looking a little too chilly for your go-to summer bag, the luxe Ticla Rambler Sleeping Bag has just the right amount of extra insulation to keep you warm on 3-season car-camping trips.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags And Accessories","product_group":"Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s443547.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l443547.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=443547&tt=df","keywords":"compact","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=443547\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m443547.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=866944&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8669440004":{"sku":"8669440004","vendor_sku":"S4BRAMMBR","upc":"636533116293","size":"M","color":"CHEVRON","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"},"8669440006":{"sku":"8669440006","vendor_sku":"S4BRAMXBR","upc":"636533116316","size":"XL","color":"CHEVRON","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"},"8669440007":{"sku":"8669440007","vendor_sku":"S4BRAMSBR","upc":"636533116286","size":"S","color":"CHEVRON","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sleeping-bags-and-accessories","sleeping-bags"]}
