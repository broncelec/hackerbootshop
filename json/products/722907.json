{"sku":"722907","manufacturer_id":"422152","brand_name":"Granite Gear","product_name":" Granite Gear Original Stowaway Canoe Seat Pack","long_description":"A great storage place to keep items accessible and out of the bilge water, this bag attaches under your canoe seat with two side release buckles. Unlike thwart bags, the Original Stowaway Seat Pack can be left in your canoe during portages. Rigid plastic bottom keeps the bag from sagging when it is heavily loaded. Updated design is now built with Cordura(R) nylon--it's every bit as strong as former material but much lighter. Fits bench style seats best but will also work with most tractor style seats.","short_description":"A great storage place to keep items accessible and out of the bilge water, this bag attaches under your canoe seat with two side release buckles.","category":"Paddling","subcategory":"Canoeing","product_group":"Canoe Accessories","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s430331.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l430331.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=430331&tt=df","retail_price":"45.95","sale_price":"45.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=430331\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m430331.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=722907&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7229070011":{"sku":"7229070011","vendor_sku":"422152","upc":"782922422152","size":"700 Cu In","color":"SAGE","retail_price":"45.95","sale_price":"45.95"}},"categories":["paddling","canoeing","canoe-accessories"]}
