{"sku":"835983","manufacturer_id":"SW056-001","brand_name":"Smartwool","product_name":"SmartWool PhD Graduated Compression Ultra Light Socks","long_description":"SmartWool PhD Graduated Compression Ultralight socks combine the performance-enhancing benefits of merino wool with recovery-enhancing compression technology. New, improved SmartWool PhD socks feature innovative new fabric, a more comfortable fit and smart design details that enhance performance. 4 Degree Elite Fit System improves comfort; 2 elastics provide greater stretch and recovery to keep the socks in place. Ankle bands, upper instep bands, lower instep bands and arch bands connect to the feet for a great fit and feel. ReliaWool is a patent-pending reinforcement construction that puts more wool in high wear/high impact areas to increase durability and comfort. Performance-enhancing merino wool helps your body maintain a stable core body temperature minimizing lactic acid build-up. Your body doesn't have to work as hard to keep you warm when it's cold and cool when it's warm. Recovery-enhancing compression improves blood flow: oxygenated blood and nutrients return to muscles faster to help muscles rebuild and repair. Lactic acid is efficiently flushed from the lower legs providing relief from muscle soreness. Reduces fluid build-up that can impede the recovery process. 20 - 30mmHg graduated compression throughout. Virtually seamless toes offer durability and a low profile. PhD Graduated Compression socks have a 14 in. height. *Discount will be applied when you check out.
