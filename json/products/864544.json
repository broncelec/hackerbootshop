{"sku":"864544","manufacturer_id":"A1Q9P66","brand_name":"The North Face","product_name":" The North Face Furnace 20 Sleeping Bag","long_description":"The down-insulated The North Face Furnace 20 Sleeping Bag has a less-tapered cut than a standard backpacking bag, giving you more room to move around on your spring, summer and fall adventures. With a European Norm (EN) lower-limit rating of 20degF, the Furnace 20 is a versatile bag for 3-season backpacking adventures when temps might dip below freezing. 550-fill-power ProDown(TM) natural goose down insulation is light and lofty. ProDown(TM) is enhanced with a hydrophobic finish that improves warmth by allowing it to dry faster and repel moisture up to 10x longer than untreated down. Anti-compression pads made from Heatseeker(TM) Eco synthetic insulation are sewn into high-pressure areas that contact the ground to create an insulating buffer. Shaped hood and down-insulated draft collar hold in warmth. Insulated draft tube backs the zipper to prevent warm air from escaping; antisnag tape keeps the zipper from catching on the draft tube. 3/4-length, 2-way zipper lets you make adjustments for ventilation. Comfort-oriented shape has a less-tapered cut than some backpacking sleeping bags, allowing you more room to move around. Footbox allows natural foot movement while also eliminating excess lateral space so you stay warm and comfortable all night long. The North Face Furnace 20 Sleeping Bag comes with a standard stuff sack. European Norm (EN) is an independent third-party temperature rating, allowing accurate comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags.","short_description":"The down-insulated The North Face Furnace 20 Sleeping Bag has a less-tapered cut than a standard backpacking bag, giving you more room to move around on your spring, summer and fall adventures.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags And Accessories","product_group":"Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s421663.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l421663.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=421663&tt=df","keywords":"compact","retail_price":"189.00","sale_price":"189.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=421663\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m421663.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=864544&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8645440001":{"sku":"8645440001","vendor_sku":"A1Q9P66","upc":"715752282528","size":"Regular Left","color":"STRIKER BLUE/ASPHALT GREY","retail_price":"179.00","sale_price":"179.00"},"8645440002":{"sku":"8645440002","vendor_sku":"A1Q9P66","upc":"715752282504","size":"Long Left","color":"STRIKER BLUE/ASPHALT GREY","retail_price":"189.00","sale_price":"189.00"}}}
