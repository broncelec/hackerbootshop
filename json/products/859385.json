{"sku":"859385","manufacturer_id":"RRC01WV","brand_name":"Rossignol","product_name":" Rossignol Roostie Skis with Bindings - Kids' - 2013/2014","long_description":"Get your little one started out right with the Rossignol Roostie skis with bindings. Meant for kids weighing less than 44 lbs., they encourage confidence with their flexible, lightweight construction. Stable and forgiving, the Rossignol Roostie skis with bindings are ideal for groomed trails at low to medium speeds. Cap construction keeps skis light and fun and boosts durability. Forgiving microcell-foam core won't punish a developing skier for small mistakes, yet it's responsive enough to encourage skill progression. Lightweight composite materials ease turn transitions and make carrying skis a breeze. Design makes it easy to step into and exit the bindings, so kids can get in and out of their skis quickly. Catering to very lightweight skiers, DIN range of 0.5 - 2.5 allows bindings to release boots easily in the event of a tumble. The Rossignol Roostie skis with bindings are recommended for kids who weigh 44 lbs. or less. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.","short_description":"Get your little one started out right with the Rossignol Roostie skis with bindings.
