{"sku":"697449","manufacturer_id":"210076","brand_name":"Black Diamond","product_name":" Black Diamond Oval Wiregate Carabiner","long_description":"This low-profile, lightweight 'biner is perfect for the aid climber looking for a strong, inexpensive high-tech oval. Simple design is actually stronger than gated biners in cross-loading or edge-loading situations--steel wire bends and stretches instead of breaking. Slender wire gate occupies less working space, leaving more room for fingers and rope. Cold-forged aluminum alloy for exceptional strength-to-weight ratio.","short_description":"This low-profile, lightweight 'biner is perfect for the aid climber looking for a strong, inexpensive high-tech oval.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Hardware","product_group":"Carabiners","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s375911.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l375911.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=375911&tt=df","retail_price":"6.95","sale_price":"6.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=375911\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m375911.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=697449&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"6974490010":{"sku":"6974490010","vendor_sku":"210076","upc":"793661030621","retail_price":"6.95","sale_price":"6.95"}},"categories":["climbing","climbing-hardware","carabiners"]}
