{"sku":"845300","manufacturer_id":"14470","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":"REI Flash Insulated Air Sleeping Pad","long_description":"The lightest backcountry pad we've ever made, the REI Flash Insulated Air Sleeping Pad also takes up very little space in your pack. Pad baffles are insulated with ultralight and ultrawarm PrimaLoft(R) Infinity fill. Air-tube construction provides cushioning; larger tubes on the outside keep you from rolling off. Advanced inflation technology features 2 flat valves: 1 for inflation and 1 for deflation. Laminated 30-denier ripstop polyester provides a good compromise between low weight and durability. Tapered mummy shape reduces weight and packed size. R-Value equals 3.2; most sleeping pads REI sells range in R-value from 1.0 (minimally insulated) to 9.5 (highly insulated). The REI Flash Insulated Air Sleeping Pad includes a stuff sack.","short_description":"The lightest backcountry pad we've ever made, the REI Flash Insulated Air Sleeping Pad also takes up very little space in your pack.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Pads, Cots And Hammocks","product_group":"Sleeping Pads","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s463451.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l463451.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=463451&tt=df","keywords":"mattress,mats","retail_price":"109.00","sale_price":"109.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=463451\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m463451.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=845300&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8453000001":{"sku":"8453000001","vendor_sku":"14470","upc":"484530000011","size":"Regular","color":"LIME SPRITZ","retail_price":"99.50","sale_price":"99.50"},"8453000002":{"sku":"8453000002","vendor_sku":"14470","upc":"484530000028","size":"Long","color":"LIME SPRITZ","retail_price":"109.00","sale_price":"109.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sleeping-pads-cots-and-hammocks","sleeping-pads"]}
