{"sku":"858646","manufacturer_id":"61308-0011-24.5","brand_name":"Dynafit","product_name":" Dynafit Mercury TF Randonee Boots - Women's - 2013/2014","long_description":"The women's Dynafit Mercury TF randonee boots offer great walkability and lightness for the approach and excellent skiing performance for backcountry descents at mach speeds and landing big drops. Women-specific design features a lower profile than the men's version to better accommodate female leg shapes. Grilamid(R) shells and fiberglass-reinforced thermoplastic urethane and Pebax(R) cuffs provide stiffness for fast descents without being too heavy for backcountry tours. Comfortable, custom thermal-formable liners are premolded on anatomic lasts for use right out of the box; liner instep areas are low volume for responsive ski performance. Roomy toe areas in the liners allow good circulation so your toes stay warm; abrasion-resistant external fabric ensures the liners will stand up to regular use. Liners are not likely to require custom thermal-forming, but they can be molded to your feet by a qualified ski shop employee. Cuff and central buckle retention system prevents unwanted release; retention system maintains the desired tension so you don't have to make adjustments before skiing down. Rear spoilers slide inside the cuffs, allowing the widest and smoothest cuff rotation possible; spoilers alleviate friction between cuffs and liners. 3mm-thick polyethylene layer in the shell provides adequate insulation to help keep your feet warm. The ski/walk mechanisms can be set between 15deg and 18deg of forward lean, as well as loosened for walking. Insert the included Downhill Booster tongues on the descent for added support, then remove them on the way back up for greater comfort and agility. Power straps help close the boots securely around your legs; straps can be removed from the rear cuffs and fixed to the Booster tongues to help you keep track of the tongues. Soles feature a mix of soft, medium and hard rubber compounds for excellent grip when hiking and compression resistance when skiing.","short_description":"The women's Dynafit Mercury TF randonee boots offer great walkability and lightness for the approach and excellent skiing performance for backcountry descents at mach speeds and landing big drops.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Randonee Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382731.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382731.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382731&tt=df","retail_price":"799.95","sale_price":"799.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382731\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382731.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=858646&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{},"extended_xml_attributes":"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"}
