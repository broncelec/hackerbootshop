{"sku":"858173","manufacturer_id":"8A315000001","brand_name":"Blizzard","product_name":" Blizzard Gunsmoke Skis - Men's - 2013-2014","long_description":"With powder-seeking, 114mm waists and naturally rockered tips and tails, the Blizzard Gunsmoke skis offer advanced skiers a lightweight, playful ride in the deep stuff. Not as stiff as metal-reinforced skis, the Gunsmoke skis use a fiberglass layup to create a softer flex for smearing pillow lines and skidding around in pow. Blizzard builds the rocker without bending the core, creating a naturally flexing, responsive ski that turns easily, resists high-speed chatter and shreds crud and pow. Light camber underfoot assists with grip on hardpack. Wood core is constructed like a sandwich with layers of precisely-milled strips reinforcing each other to create a lightweight, snappy ski with smooth and easy handling. True twin profile provides equal responsiveness whether you're skiing forward or backward. Sidewalls direct power right to the edges of the skis, resulting in quick side-to-side response. 114mm waists require bindings with wide brakes.","short_description":"With powder-seeking, 114mm waists and naturally rockered tips and tails, the Blizzard Gunsmoke skis offer advanced skiers a lightweight, playful ride in the deep stuff.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s381959.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l381959.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=381959&tt=df","retail_price":"699.95","sale_price":"489.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=381959\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m381959.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=858173&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8581730001":{"sku":"8581730001","vendor_sku":"8A315000001","upc":"885315549631","size":"179 CM","color":"BLUE/GREEN","retail_price":"489.83","sale_price":"489.83"},"8581730002":{"sku":"8581730002","vendor_sku":"8A315000001","upc":"885315549648","size":"186 CM","color":"BLUE/GREEN","retail_price":"489.83","sale_price":"489.83"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
