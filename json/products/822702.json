Zip-off bottoms convert pants to shorts. Perfect for commuting or cruising, the quick drying, lightweight stretch outer pants endure daily use; gusseted crotch allows unrestricted range of motion. Fabric is treated with a durable water repellent finish for water resistance and quick drying. Features removable and moisture-wicking polyester/spandex stretch mesh liner shorts. Built-in Zoic Assault ZO-Wick chamois is anatomically molded for comfort and support. Integrated knit mesh panels facilitate cooling airflow between outer and inner shorts. Liner shorts feature a tagless waistline; leg grippers keep liner shorts in place as you move. Zoic Black Market Convertible pants feature 2 front hand pockets, twin angled zip pockets on thigh and a rear zippered pocket; right thigh pocket features a sunglass wipe. Lower back side features a MP3/cell phone pocket with headphone port and cord loop that keeps cord close to body. Dial in the fit with the partially elaticized waistband, adjustable belt and traditional zip fly with snap closure. Pant-leg hem rolls up to keep fabric away from chain and crank, exposing the reflective stripe on the underside of cuff; hold up pant legs with buttons and button holes.","short_description":"An all-weather friend for work and play, the Zoic Black Market Convertible pants transform from a weekday commuter to a weekend assaulter of the trail.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Cycling Clothing","product_group":"Cycling Tights And Pants","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s451331.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l451331.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=451331&tt=df","retail_price":"75.00","sale_price":"75.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=451331\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m451331.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=822702&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8227020001":{"sku":"8227020001","vendor_sku":"111BMC11","upc":"716550066976","size":"M","color":"BLACK-ISH","retail_price":"75.00","sale_price":"75.00"},"8227020002":{"sku":"8227020002","vendor_sku":"111BMC11","upc":"716550066983","size":"L","color":"BLACK-ISH","retail_price":"75.00","sale_price":"75.00"},"8227020003":{"sku":"8227020003","vendor_sku":"111BMC11","upc":"716550066990","size":"XL","color":"BLACK-ISH","retail_price":"75.00","sale_price":"75.00"},"8227020007":{"sku":"8227020007","vendor_sku":"111BMC11","upc":"716550067003","size":"XXL","color":"BLACK-ISH","retail_price":"75.00","sale_price":"75.00"}},"categories":["cycling","cycling-clothing","cycling-tights-and-pants"]}
