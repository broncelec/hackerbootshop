{"sku":"876328","manufacturer_id":"234184-014","brand_name":"Scott","product_name":"Scott Contessa Solace 35 Compact Women's Bike - 2014","long_description":"With reliable Shimano components and a featherlight carbon frame designed for women, the 17.75 lb. Scott Contessa Solace 35 Compact road bike balances comfort and speed during long rides. Carbon-fiber frame features 2 zones: a stiff Power Zone around the drivetrain that transfers energy efficiently and a flexible, shock-damping cockpit Comfort Zone. Geometry is not as aggressive as a full-bred race bike, but it offers plenty of efficiency for long days in the saddle; frame is designed to maximize comfort for women. The 1-1/8 in. full-carbon steerer enhances precision. Shimano 105 rear derailleur and shifters along with Tiagra front derailleur offer reliable, precise shifts throughout the 20 gear combinations. Compact crankset drives a wide-ranging 12-30 cassette for a versatile range of 20 gears to handle tough hills and speedy flats. Lightweight and smooth Syncros RR2.0 wheels are outfitted with fast and grippy Schwalbe Durano tires. Pedals sold separately. Specs on the Scott Contessa Solace 35 Compact road bike are subject to change.","short_description":"With reliable Shimano components and a featherlight carbon frame designed for women, the 17.75 lb.
