{"sku":"860800","manufacturer_id":"AA0024856157","brand_name":"Atomic","product_name":"Atomic Supreme Skis - Women's - 2013/2014","long_description":"A speedy ride with nimble 87mm waists and rockered tips and tails, the women's Atomic Supreme skis shred groomed runs with authority and confidence-inspiring stability. When skis are weighted, there is a slight rise in the tips that makes it easy to initiate turns. When skis are put on edge after starting a turn, the camber flattens out to deliver full-length contact with snow and excellent edge hold. Wood core provide smooth handling at high speeds and in deep powder, and carbon \"backbone\" insert enhances edge grip and reduces vibrations for excellent stability. Sidewall construction ensures maximum torsional rigidity, uncanny edge grip and controlled tip-to-tail flex; sidewall is reinforced in binding area with 3 layers of material. Half cap construction in tip and tail reduces swing weight and chipping when your skis bang together. The women's Atomic Supreme skis features a directional sidecut that favors skiing forward but allows you to ski and land jumps backward. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.","short_description":"A speedy ride with nimble 87mm waists and rockered tips and tails, the women's Atomic Supreme skis shred groomed runs with authority and confidence-inspiring stability.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382323.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382323.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382323&tt=df","retail_price":"399.00","sale_price":"319.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382323\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382323.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=860800&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8608000001":{"sku":"8608000001","vendor_sku":"AA0024856157","upc":"884397739589","size":"157 CM","retail_price":"319.93","sale_price":"319.93"},"8608000002":{"sku":"8608000002","vendor_sku":"AA0024856165","upc":"884397739596","size":"165 CM","retail_price":"319.93","sale_price":"319.93"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
