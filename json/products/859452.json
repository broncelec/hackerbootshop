{"sku":"859452","manufacturer_id":"RC1A022","brand_name":"Rossignol","product_name":" Rossignol Axium 110 XL Downhill Ski Bindings","long_description":"The intermediate-level Rossignol Axium 110 XL downhill ski bindings are exceptionally lightweight and incredibly simple to enter and use. They fit all-mountain wide skis to 95mm in waist width. Streamlined design and lightweight materials create a low total weight for skis and bindings combined, which reduces skier fatigue. Toepieces decrease the friction in twisting falls and allow the boots to exit the bindings in multiple directions. Four points of contact enhance power transmission, and wide mounting area works well with today's shaped and rockered skis. Heels provide natural, simple step-in; long lever arms make exiting the bindings simple. 100mm brakes accommodate all-mountain-wide skis; Rossignol recommends mounting bindings on skis up to 95mm underfoot. The intermediate-level Rossignol Axium 110 XL downhill ski bindings feature DIN 3.5 - 11 release settings.","short_description":"The intermediate-level Rossignol Axium 110 XL downhill ski bindings are exceptionally lightweight and incredibly simple to enter and use.
