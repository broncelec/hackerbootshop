{"sku":"857901","manufacturer_id":"B130302002070","brand_name":"K2","product_name":"K2 Haven Snowboard Boots - Women's - 2013/2014","long_description":"K2 Haven snowboard boots have all-mountain performance and style at a price that begs for a full-time shred and part-time job. Boa(TM) lacing ensures a great fit, every time you lace up your boots. Boa(R) Coiler lacing system, with ankle and cable guides along entire edge of eyestays, distributes closure force evenly for a dialed-in fit that won't loosen up. The Coiler scoops up loose cable when entering as well as exiting the boot; put your foot in, pull back on the tongue, twist the reel a few times and you're off. Intuition(TM) Comfort-Foam 3D liners conform to feet after a few days of riding; moldable, internal J-bars enhance heel hold. Quick, single-pull liner lacing requires only one hand to use and stays locked until you release it with the comfortable webbing loop pulls. Low-profile, low-bulk cushioned soles absorb impact, enhance board feel and provide tractorlike grip.","short_description":"K2 Haven snowboard boots have all-mountain performance and style at a price that begs for a full-time shred and part-time job.
