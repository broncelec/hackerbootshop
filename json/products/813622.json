{"sku":"813622","manufacturer_id":"SOL-AL","brand_name":"Jetboil","product_name":"Jetboil Sol Stove","long_description":"The lightweight, compact Jetboil Sol(TM) stove features a fuel regulator for consistent heat-output whether you're camped out in the dead of winter or perched atop an alpine peak. Burner features a fuel regulator that maintains consistent flow of gas down to 20degF, making the Sol suitable for 4-season use. Includes a 0.8-liter aluminum FluxRing(R) cooking cup with insulating cozy. Same as the original Jetboil, the stove burner and cooking cup twist together to create a single convenient cooking system; disconnect the burner and cooking cup for storage. FluxRing(R) heat exchanger on the bottom of the cooking cup creates excellent fuel efficiency. Adjustable-flame burner is housed in a windscreen, reducing heat loss when a breeze blows through. Push-button piezo igniter sparks the stove to life quickly and easily. Drink-through lid features a pour spout and a built-in strainer. Stove burner and 100g fuel canister (sold separately) stow inside the cup; lid snaps shut for storage. Bottom cover unsnaps from the cooking cup to double as a measuring cup or bowl; measuring cup comes in handy when preparing meals and hot drinks. Includes a stabilizer tripod that clips onto fuel canister (sold separately). Please note: 10.5 oz. weight specification does not include the weight of the fuel stabilizer and measuring cup. Sol stove is compatible with all Jetboil accessories, sold separately; Sol companion cups can be purchased separately. Due to flammable item shipping restrictions, we cannot sell fuel canisters online; they are available at REI retail stores. Because this stove system has a capacity of less than 1 liter, the average boil time specification represents the time required to do 2 separate boils of 0.5 liter of water.","short_description":"The lightweight, compact Jetboil Sol(TM) stove features a fuel regulator for consistent heat-output whether you're camped out in the dead of winter or perched atop an alpine peak.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Camp Kitchen","product_group":"Stoves","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s463327.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l463327.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=463327&tt=df","retail_price":"119.95","sale_price":"119.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=463327\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m463327.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=813622&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8136220001":{"sku":"8136220001","vendor_sku":"SOL-AL","upc":"893483000618","color":"GRAPHITE","retail_price":"119.95","sale_price":"119.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","camp-kitchen","stoves"]}
