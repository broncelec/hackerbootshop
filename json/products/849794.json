{"sku":"849794","manufacturer_id":"06951","brand_name":"Platypus","product_name":"Platypus GravityWorks Water Filter System Reservoir Kit - 2 Liter","long_description":"Platypus took the already fast and easy-to-use GravityWorks(TM) filter system and came up with this smaller and lighter 2-liter version for your backcountry travels. System includes a 2-liter dirty collection reservoir, a 2-liter Platy bottle, GravityWorks filter cartridge, in-line adapter and hoses. Fill the dirty collection reservoir, hang it above the clean Platy bottle and let gravity carry the water through the filter-filtering water has never been so easy! Hollow fiber filter technology offers a high flow rate of 1.5 liters per minute-that's 2 liters in less than 90 sec. Filter physically removes particles, protozoa, and bacteria down to 0.2 microns in size, including giardia, salmonella, cryptosporidia and others. Unfiltered reservoir features a quick-disconnect valve that automatically shuts off the flow of water when hose is disconnected. Use the included push/pull adapter to connect the GravityWorks system directly into any Platy bottle with a push/pull cap; also works with many other bottles and reservoirs. Clean the system by simply holding the filtered-water reservoir above the unfiltered-water reservoir to backflush the filter. Taste-free reservoirs and silicone hoses ensure great-tasting water. Platypus GravityWorks 2-liter water filter system reservoir kit weighs only 11.5 oz.","short_description":"Platypus took the already fast and easy-to-use GravityWorks(TM) filter system and came up with this smaller and lighter 2-liter version for your backcountry travels.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Water Bottles And Treatment","product_group":"Water Treatment","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s426411.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l426411.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=426411&tt=df","retail_price":"109.95","sale_price":"109.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=426411\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m426411.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=849794&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8497940001":{"sku":"8497940001","vendor_sku":"06951","upc":"040818069516","retail_price":"109.95","sale_price":"109.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","water-bottles-and-treatment","water-treatment"]}
