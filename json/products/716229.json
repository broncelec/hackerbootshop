They'll shave ounces off your alpine pack. Extremely strong, lightweight alloy construction keeps the weight to a single pound for the pair. Ideal for ski touring, ski mountaineering and classic alpine mountaineering routes. Heel and toe harness pieces accommodate a wide variety of footwear; single webbing strap secures crampon in place. Low-profile crampon frame places the foot closer to rock or ice. Flexible connecting rod allows the foot free movement without over-stressing the crampon. Latex Antibott (included) sheets prevent snow build-up beneath the crampons. Tool-free adjustment; fits U.S. sizes from 4 - 12.","short_description":"When weight's a determining factor, pack these crampons along.
