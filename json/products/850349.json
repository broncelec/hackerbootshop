{"sku":"850349","manufacturer_id":"M53D 17","brand_name":"Petzl","product_name":"Petzl Spirit Express Quickdraw Set","long_description":"The Petzl Spirit Express quickdraw set is designed for quickly clipping bolts and extending gear placements so you can get through the crux and continue on to the top of the climb. Includes a Spirit straight gate carabiner on one end and a Spirit bent gate carabiner on the other; bent gate 'biner has been reworked to make clipping the rope even easier. H-shaped profiles offer an improved strength-to-weight ratio over the previous versions of the Spirit carabiners; each 'biner is 10g lighter than the previous version. Both 'biners feature keylock noses that won't snag on pro, ropes or slings, making them simple to clip. Surfaces that come into contact with the climbing rope are wider than other parts of the carabiner for smooth passage of the rope and reduced wear on the 'biner. 'Biners are connected with either a 12cm or 17cm Express polyester sewn sling. Rubber webbing protector at the bottom of the sling reduces abrasion while also keeping the rope-end carabiner properly positioned. The Petzl Spirit Express quickdraw set is available in 12cm or 17cm lengths.","short_description":"The Petzl Spirit Express quickdraw set is designed for quickly clipping bolts and extending gear placements so you can get through the crux and continue on to the top of the climb.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Hardware","product_group":"Quickdraws","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s380227.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l380227.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=380227&tt=df","retail_price":"22.95","sale_price":"22.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=380227\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m380227.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=850349&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8503490002":{"sku":"8503490002","vendor_sku":"M53D 17","size":"17 CM","color":"MULTI","retail_price":"22.95","sale_price":"22.95"}},"categories":["climbing","climbing-hardware","quickdraws"]}
