Edge Pressure System equalizes the force between the heel and toe piece, directing it over the edge of the ski for smooth-carving turns. During a backwards or twisting fall, the upward-release system in the toe reduces the forces that could damage young joints and bones. Gliding antifriction device under the ball of the foot allows boot position to adjust to changing forces for enhanced safety and performance. Built for junior skiers weighing 53 to 165 lbs. The Marker M7.0 EPS Junior downhill ski bindings feature a brake width of 74mm.","short_description":"The Marker M7.0 EPS Junior downhill ski bindings have the same safety and performance features found in Marker adult bindings.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Bindings","product_group":"Downhill Ski Bindings","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s381531.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l381531.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=381531&tt=df","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=381531\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m381531.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=824135&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8241350001":{"sku":"8241350001","vendor_sku":"6220M1.WS","upc":"883295100729","color":"WHITE/BLACK","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"}},"categories":["snow","ski-bindings","downhill-ski-bindings"]}
