{"sku":"806818","manufacturer_id":"101370SML","brand_name":"Black Diamond","product_name":" Black Diamond O1 Midstiff Telemark Binding - Small","long_description":"The Black Diamond O1 Midstiff telemark bindings (small size) give you resistance-free touring with powerful downhill performance so you can go farther and ski harder. With the push of a ski pole tip, these high-performance bindings convert to an efficient, resistance-free touring machine. Stainless-steel, 1-piece toe box and variable-height toe riser design provide a natural, solid boot interface for power transfer. Under-the-boot cable routing serves up a progressive flex and keeps the springs away from your edges. Oversized, precompressed spring cartridges create consistent tension; comes with midstiff cartridges installed. Midstiff cartridges provide an all-around flex that's well suited for backcountry touring and inbounds skiing. 3 cartridge stiffness levels allow you to tune bindings to match boot stiffness and skiing style (stiff/freeflex cartridges available from Black Diamond; not available at REI). Long climbing wires snap into position to reduce climbing fatigue. Attach ski leashes (sold separately) to prevent runaway skis when skiing at the resort. Black Diamond O1 small bindings fit boot sole lengths 265mm - 295mm.","short_description":"The Black Diamond O1 Midstiff telemark bindings (small size) give you resistance-free touring with powerful downhill performance so you can go farther and ski harder.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Bindings","product_group":"Telemark Ski Bindings","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s381735.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l381735.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=381735&tt=df","retail_price":"299.95","sale_price":"299.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=381735\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m381735.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=806818&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8068180010":{"sku":"8068180010","vendor_sku":"101370SML","upc":"793661137733","color":"SILVER","retail_price":"299.95","sale_price":"299.95"}}}
