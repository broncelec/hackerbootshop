{"sku":"866722","manufacturer_id":"20108025","brand_name":"Hoka One One","product_name":" Hoka One One Conquest Road-Running Shoes - Women's","long_description":"The women's Hoka One One Conquest Road-Running Shoes are ideal for runners looking for highly responsive and cushioned shoes for moving fast on paved trails and city streets. EVA midsoles feature foam that is 30% softer than traditional running shoe foam, and 2.5 times more voluminous; this extra cushioning dissipates shock from heel striking. 4mm heel-to-toe drop encourages a natural midfoot or forefoot strike to promote forward momentum and further reduce the impact of heel striking. Active Foot Frame midsole geometry allows the feet to sink into the shoes as opposed to sitting on top to provide great feedback to the feet while you're running. Highly breathable, no-sew uppers provide a seamless and secure fit; shoes are designed to drain water if you step in a puddle. Polyester linings wick moisture away from feet for extended comfort ; comfort collars won't irritate your ankles. The Hoka One One Conquest Road-Running Shoes feature single-pull lacing for easy and quick on/off. Sticky rubber outsoles grip wet and dry surfaces with ease.","short_description":"The women's Hoka One One Conquest Road-Running Shoes are ideal for runners looking for highly responsive and cushioned shoes for moving fast on paved trails and city streets.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Women's Footwear","product_group":"Women's Shoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s388103.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l388103.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=388103&tt=df","retail_price":"170.00","sale_price":"170.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=388103\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m388103.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=866722&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8667220001":{"sku":"8667220001","vendor_sku":"20108025","upc":"887278725077","size":"6","color":"PARADISE/CASTLEROCK/CITRU","retail_price":"170.00","sale_price":"170.00"},"8667220002":{"sku":"8667220002","vendor_sku":"20108025","upc":"887278725084","size":"6.5","color":"PARADISE/CASTLEROCK/CITRU","retail_price":"170.00","sale_price":"170.00"},"8667220004":{"sku":"8667220004","vendor_sku":"20108025","upc":"887278725107","size":"7.5","color":"PARADISE/CASTLEROCK/CITRU","retail_price":"170.00","sale_price":"170.00"},"8667220005":{"sku":"8667220005","vendor_sku":"20108025","upc":"887278725114","size":"8","color":"PARADISE/CASTLEROCK/CITRU","retail_price":"170.00","sale_price":"170.00"},"8667220006":{"sku":"8667220006","vendor_sku":"20108025","upc":"887278725121","size":"8.5","color":"PARADISE/CASTLEROCK/CITRU","retail_price":"170.00","sale_price":"170.00"},"8667220007":{"sku":"8667220007","vendor_sku":"20108025","upc":"887278725138","size":"9","color":"PARADISE/CASTLEROCK/CITRU","retail_price":"170.00","sale_price":"170.00"},"8667220008":{"sku":"8667220008","vendor_sku":"20108025","upc":"887278725145","size":"9.5","color":"PARADISE/CASTLEROCK/CITRU","retail_price":"170.00","sale_price":"170.00"}}}
