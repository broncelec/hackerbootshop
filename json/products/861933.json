{"sku":"861933","manufacturer_id":"15918","brand_name":"Novara","product_name":" Novara Rhumba Bike Tank Top - Women's","long_description":"The women's Novara Rhumba Bike Tank Top is a great choice for either a casual summer cruise or a more intense day ride. It's also a good option for a spin or yoga class. Polyester/spandex fabric draws moisture away from skin to fabric's outer face for quick evaporation, so you stay dry and comfortable. Built-in \"free floating\" shelf bra lets tank move freely, adds support and creates a 2-layered look. Long length and a slight droptail hem ensure full coverage in the riding position. 2 zippered side pockets. The Novara Rhumba Bike Tank Top has reflective detailing to increase your visibility in low light.","short_description":"The women's Novara Rhumba Bike Tank Top is a great choice for either a casual summer cruise or a more intense day ride.
