{"sku":"860311","manufacturer_id":"113151.D04.171","brand_name":"Volkl","product_name":"Volkl RTM 81 Skis with Bindings - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Light, lively and rockered, the advanced-level Volkl RTM 81 skis with bindings use reinforced sidewalls to increase precision on groomers and transition easily to soft snow when given the chance. Built with all features of the RTM 80 skis, the RTM 81 skis raise the performance one more notch by using reinforced sidewalls to directly transfer energy into precise turns. When tipped over and put on edge, the smooth, gradual rocker from tip to tail creates uninterrupted edge contact during the turn, ripping graceful arcs into groomed terrain. Full rocker also increases maneuverability in soft snow, so you can play on the backside of the mountain or hunt down overlooked stashes of pow. You'll notice a lively, snappy feel when powering through turns thanks to the steel laminate built into the wood core. High-performance bindings are integrated into the body of the skis, creating a rigid connection that precisely transfers your motions. Extremely lightweight toe and heel components securely wrap the boot lugs and make driving skis through the turns that much easier. Bindings feature DIN 4 - 12 release settings, a range suited to advanced skiers at medium to high speeds. Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo.","short_description":"Light, lively and rockered, the advanced-level Volkl RTM 81 skis with bindings use reinforced sidewalls to increase precision on groomers and transition easily to soft snow when given the chance.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382247.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382247.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382247&tt=df","retail_price":"899.00","sale_price":"599.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382247\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382247.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=860311&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8603110001":{"sku":"8603110001","vendor_sku":"113151.D04.166","upc":"821264547595","size":"166 CM","retail_price":"599.83","sale_price":"599.83"},"8603110002":{"sku":"8603110002","vendor_sku":"113151.D04.171","upc":"821264547601","size":"171 CM","retail_price":"599.83","sale_price":"599.83"},"8603110003":{"sku":"8603110003","vendor_sku":"113151.D04.176","upc":"821264547618","size":"176 CM","retail_price":"599.83","sale_price":"599.83"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
