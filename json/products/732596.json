{"sku":"732596","manufacturer_id":"RS5510","brand_name":"Stan's Notubes","product_name":" Stan's NoTubes Stan's No Tubes Tubeless System","long_description":"This kit will allow you to convert your non-tubeless wheelset to a tubeless system. System offers puncture resistence, reduced wheelset weight, and vastly decreased rolling resistence. Unique two-seal-point design allows you to break the bead lock seal without losing air pressure. Inner seal flexes inwards with the tire to maintain air pressure. Patented rim strip makes installation simple; it can be removed as easily as a tube and can be used over and over again. The rim strip features a new presta valve stem with a removable core allowing you to add sealant without removing the tire. Rim Sealant can also be used in tubeless tires for puncture resistance and to stop leaks. Works well with 24 in. - 26 in. rims measuring 21.5 mm - 24 mm in width.","short_description":"This kit will allow you to convert your non-tubeless wheelset to a tubeless system.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Components","product_group":"Bike Tires, Tubes And Wheels","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s389167.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l389167.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=389167&tt=df","retail_price":"60.00","sale_price":"60.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=389167\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m389167.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=732596&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7325960016":{"sku":"7325960016","vendor_sku":"RS5510","upc":"183720000014","size":"26","retail_price":"60.00","sale_price":"60.00"}}}
