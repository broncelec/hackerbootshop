{"sku":"822571","manufacturer_id":"892578","brand_name":"Salomon","product_name":"Salomon Elite 8 Edge Grip Cross-Country Skis","long_description":"Salomon Elite 8 Edge Grip cross-country skis are great for general touring and off-trail exploring. Their partial metal edges and high-performance waxless pattern offer good control. Densolite 2000 cores features preshaped Densolite foam with bidirectional fiberglass wraps to keep the skis light and torsionally stiff. Make your way down icy slopes with added control thanks to partial steel edges located toward the front and back of the skis. G2 Plus waxless pattern on the bases delivers a combination of excellent grip and glide; sharp grip edges bite into snow when you kick and are smooth and quiet when you glide. Camber is tuned for easy compression and good grip when pressing with the forefoot; grip zone remains lifted when pressing with the mid or rear of the foot for good glide. Light carving sidecut near the middle of the skis and a wider platform near the front provides good control and stability when descending out of the groomed tracks. Quality bases on the Salomon Elite 8 Edge Grip cross-country skis retain wax for good performance on all types of snow.","short_description":"Salomon Elite 8 Edge Grip cross-country skis are great for general touring and off-trail exploring.
