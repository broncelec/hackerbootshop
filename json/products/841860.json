{"sku":"841860","manufacturer_id":"05081600 9C5","brand_name":"Nordica","product_name":"Nordica Ace of Spades Team Ski Boots - Juniors' - 2012/2013","long_description":"Perfect for up-and-coming freestylers, the Nordica Ace of Spades Team ski boots offers the shock-absorbent comfort of adult boots in a smaller size. The Nordica Ace of Spades Team ski boots feature a 3-piece shell construction that makes it easy to get feet into boots. Boots flex lightly at first, then as you put greater pressure on tongues during turn, the resistance increases and enhances precision. After flexing, boots return to upright position, setting skis up for the next turn. Middle buckles clamp down on feet at a 45deg angle to keep heels securely seated and increase comfort in forefeet. Shock-absorbent technology helps them hone their park-and-pipe skills while enjoying comfort. Additional padding in the tongues and cuffs absorbs shock and damps vibrations, making the ride smooth and easy. Kids' liners feature soft padding and a warm fleecy lining. Loop on tongues aids in putting the boots on and taking them off. 3-buckle closures offer solid leverage to ensure the best possible wrappings of the feet; instep retention promotes safe and comfortable landings. All 3 aluminum buckles are microadjustable, so young skiers can dial in the fit for comfort and performance. Cuff straps act as a fourth buckle, letting the user adjust tightness around the upper ankle. Flex index of 90 offers resistance appropriate for young skiers.","short_description":"Perfect for up-and-coming freestylers, the Nordica Ace of Spades Team ski boots offers the shock-absorbent comfort of adult boots in a smaller size.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Downhill Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382491.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382491.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382491&tt=df","keywords":"jstp7615","retail_price":"249.00","sale_price":"173.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382491\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382491.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=841860&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8418600001":{"sku":"8418600001","vendor_sku":"05081600 9C5","upc":"885315290991","size":"Mondo 23.5","color":"BLACK/GREEN","retail_price":"173.83","sale_price":"173.83"},"8418600002":{"sku":"8418600002","vendor_sku":"05081600 9C5","upc":"885315291011","size":"Mondo 24.5","color":"BLACK/GREEN","retail_price":"173.83","sale_price":"173.83"},"8418600003":{"sku":"8418600003","vendor_sku":"05081600 9C5","upc":"885315291035","size":"Mondo 25.5","color":"BLACK/GREEN","retail_price":"173.83","sale_price":"173.83"},"8418600004":{"sku":"8418600004","vendor_sku":"05081600 9C5","upc":"885315291059","size":"Mondo 26.5","color":"BLACK/GREEN","retail_price":"173.83","sale_price":"173.83"}},"categories":["snow","ski-boots","downhill-ski-boots"]}
