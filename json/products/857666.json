{"sku":"857666","manufacturer_id":"10551100962","brand_name":"Burton","product_name":" Burton Infidel Snowboard Bindings - 2013/2014","long_description":"With a soft flex made for the park and extra-soft highbacks that move with you, Burton Infidel snowboard bindings are finely-tuned bindings built for throwing down tricks. Single-component, lightweight yet tough, polycarbonate baseplates create moderate flex and consistent response for a versatile ride. Single-component, Gumbo highbacks are ultra responsive; minimized design saves precious weight, and they rotate to follow natural leg contours, optimizing comfort and power. Highbacks feature Over The Top padding for extra cushioning that won't bite your calves. Tool-free, forward-lean micro adjustment lets you dial in and lock forward your lean angle on the fly; forward lean adjusts independently of side-to-side rotation. FullBED cushioning covers the entire baseplate to maximize comfort and minimize fatigue; extendable toe ramps reduce toe drag and increase responsiveness. Primo Capstrap(TM) toe straps lock you into the bindings; lushly padded, precurved ankle straps feature telescoping and multi-location adjustability. Smooth Glide(TM) buckles are strong and easy to grab for quick closure and release. Burton Custom bindings are compatible with traditional 3D(TM), 4x4 bolt patterns and The Channel.","short_description":"With a soft flex made for the park and extra-soft highbacks that move with you, Burton Infidel snowboard bindings are finely-tuned bindings built for throwing down tricks.","category":"Snowboarding","subcategory":"Snowboard Bindings","product_group":"Strap Snowboard Bindings","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s383047.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l383047.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=383047&tt=df","retail_price":"179.95","sale_price":"125.83","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=383047\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m383047.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=857666&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8576660001":{"sku":"8576660001","vendor_sku":"10551100962","upc":"886888615709","size":"M","color":"IRIE","retail_price":"125.83","sale_price":"125.83"},"8576660002":{"sku":"8576660002","vendor_sku":"10551100962","upc":"886888615693","size":"L","color":"IRIE","retail_price":"125.83","sale_price":"125.83"}}}
