{"sku":"819973","manufacturer_id":"N0812211","brand_name":"Kelty","product_name":"Kelty Salida 2 Tent","long_description":"The Kelty Salida tent is designed for 3-season use and is a great all-around, lightweight backpacking tent. A quote from the 2011. \"Tents tend to seesaw between weight and price: As one goes up, the other goes down. The light-load, low-cost Salida 2 turns that equation on its head\". With over 10 ft. of vestibule space and a spacious interior, this tent offers a comfortable backcountry escape. Freestanding design with color-coded clip construction is easy to set up and maneuver around. Mesh walls encourage good cross-ventilation. DAC(R) Pressfit aluminum poles offer durability and longevity. Polyester rainfly won't sag when wet; adjustable webbing/side-release buckles attach rainfly to tent. ArcEdge(TM) catenary floor/wall design keeps seams off the ground and watertight; taped seams ensure weather protection. Kelty Salida 2 tent features internal storage pockets, gear loft loops, noiseless zipper pulls and multiple guyout points. Includes stuff sacks, guyline/tighteners and stakes.","short_description":"The Kelty Salida tent is designed for 3-season use and is a great all-around, lightweight backpacking tent.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Tents","product_group":"Backpacking Tents","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s423807.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l423807.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=423807&tt=df","retail_price":"169.95","sale_price":"169.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=423807\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m423807.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=819973&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8199730001":{"sku":"8199730001","vendor_sku":"N0812211","upc":"727880016678","color":"DEEP ORANGE/GREY","retail_price":"169.95","sale_price":"169.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","tents","backpacking-tents"]}
