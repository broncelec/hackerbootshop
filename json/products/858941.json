{"sku":"858941","manufacturer_id":"1493975-6D1-825","brand_name":"Louis Garneau","product_name":" Louis Garneau Yeti 825 Snowshoes","long_description":"When steep ascents are your ticket to the summit, the Louis Garneau Yeti 825 snowshoes will get you there. High-performance double Boa(R) closures provide a precise fit that's simple to adjust. Contact Pro harnesses with EVA padding and Boa closures wrap the feet for secure, all-around support; they accommodate any shoe, including climbing, ski and snowboard boots. Two lightweight Boa dial closures allow for quick, easy micro-adjustments for a perfect fit that eliminates pressure points and slippage. The Boa dial retention system weighs up to 80% less than traditional strapping systems; made of stainless steel, the system won't absorb water which also keeps weight low. Free-flexing pivot points help absorb shock and allow feet to rotate freely for an efficient stride with more control. Quick-release buckles at heels offer easy entry/exit. Lightweight, puncture-proof HyperDeck decking stays pliable in very cold temperatures and stands up to the elements for long-lasting use. Contoured 7076-T6 aircraft-grade aluminum frame won't rust, sheds snow and has an ergonomic design for a natural stride; decking fastening system enhances lateral traction. Lightweight V-rail stainless-steel crampons are extremely durable and ensure maximum traction uphill, downhill and traversing; heel risers reduce calf fatigue while climbing. Louis Garneau Yeti 825 snowshoes measure 8 x 25 in. and have a recommended load weight of 100-200 lbs.","short_description":"When steep ascents are your ticket to the summit, the Louis Garneau Yeti 825 snowshoes will get you there.
