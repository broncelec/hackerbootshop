{"sku":"850786","manufacturer_id":"F6003-072","brand_name":"Wigwam","product_name":" Wigwam Merino Airlite Pro Socks","long_description":"For those who want minimal fabric between their feet and shoes, the Wigwam Merino Airlite Pro socks are ultralight, non-cushioned socks that wick moisture and add a little protection. Merino wool wicks naturally away moisture and breathes to regulate temperature for outstanding comfort in a variety of conditions. dri-release(R) is a blend of natural and man-made fibers that work together to absorb and move moisture away from the skin; it dries more rapidly than other fibers. Stretch nylon and polyester add durability and a fit that conforms to your feet. FreshGuard elements are permanently embedded in dri-release fabric; together they absorb moisture and quickly push it through the fabric into the air to minimize odor creation. Wigwam Merino Airlite Pro socks feature non-cushioned bottoms; stay-put, crew-height legs pull moisture from skin for stay-dry comfort. Seamless toe closures prevent toe irritation. dri-release content: 85% polyester/15% cotton. *Discount will be applied when you check out. Offer not valid for sale-price items ending in $._3 or $._9.","short_description":"For those who want minimal fabric between their feet and shoes, the Wigwam Merino Airlite Pro socks are ultralight, non-cushioned socks that wick moisture and add a little protection.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Socks","product_group":"Hiking Socks","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s378043.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l378043.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=378043&tt=df","retail_price":"14.00","sale_price":"14.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=378043\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m378043.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=850786&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8507860001":{"sku":"8507860001","vendor_sku":"F6003-072","upc":"048323513173","size":"M","color":"GREY","retail_price":"14.00","sale_price":"14.00"},"8507860002":{"sku":"8507860002","vendor_sku":"F6003-072","upc":"048323513180","size":"L","color":"GREY","retail_price":"14.00","sale_price":"14.00"},"8507860003":{"sku":"8507860003","vendor_sku":"F6003-072","upc":"048323513197","size":"XL","color":"GREY","retail_price":"14.00","sale_price":"14.00"},"8507860004":{"sku":"8507860004","vendor_sku":"F6003-052","upc":"048323513111","size":"M","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"14.00","sale_price":"14.00"},"8507860005":{"sku":"8507860005","vendor_sku":"F6003-052","upc":"048323513128","size":"L","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"14.00","sale_price":"14.00"},"8507860006":{"sku":"8507860006","vendor_sku":"F6003-052","upc":"048323513135","size":"XL","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"14.00","sale_price":"14.00"}},"categories":["footwear","socks","hiking-socks"]}
