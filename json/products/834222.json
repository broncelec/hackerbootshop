{"sku":"834222","manufacturer_id":"14-01-01","brand_name":"Switch","product_name":" Switch B7 Polarized Interchangeable Sunglasses","long_description":"Switch B7 polarized interchangeable sunglasses keep your eyes protected, featuring thick temples and oversize rectangular lenses for full coverage on bright days. Polarized lenses reduce 99% of visible glare from water, snow, sand and pavement for increased visual acuity and decreased eye strain. Switch interchangeable system uses high-energy embedded magnets, so lenses jump into place when brought near the frames. Magnets are engineered to stay in place when subjected to the intense jarring of skiing, snowboarding, running or mountain biking. Superior grade nylon frames offer a consistent fit and flexibility in all temperatures and are extremely impact resistant. Frames include 2 sets of lenses-1 set of polarized lenses for bright light and 1 set of non-polarized, rose-tinted lenses for low light. All frames come with gray polarized lenses, which provide true color definition on bright, sunny days; lens mirror coatings vary between frames. Lightweight and virtually shatterproof, polycarbonate lenses are 20 times more impact resistant than glass and one-third the weight. TriGuard(TM) thin-film lens coating is easy to clean, withstands rough handling and causes water to bead up and run off. Magnetic LensPod(TM) keeps your lenses protected in an easy-to-carry, contoured case. Switch B7 polarized sunglasses also come with a microfiber cleaning pouch. Medium to large fit.","short_description":"Switch B7 polarized interchangeable sunglasses keep your eyes protected, featuring thick temples and oversize rectangular lenses for full coverage on bright days.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sunglasses","product_group":"Sport Sunglasses","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s423007.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l423007.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=423007&tt=df","keywords":"Cycling","retail_price":"149.00","sale_price":"149.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=423007\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m423007.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=834222&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8342220001":{"sku":"8342220001","vendor_sku":"14-01-01","upc":"813046010892","size":"GREY POLAR/SILVER MIRROR","color":"MATTE BLACK","retail_price":"149.00","sale_price":"149.00"},"8342220003":{"sku":"8342220003","vendor_sku":"14-07-03","upc":"813046010939","size":"AMBER POLAR/BRONZE MIRROR","color":"CACTUS","retail_price":"149.00","sale_price":"149.00"}}}
