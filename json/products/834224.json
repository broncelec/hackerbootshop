{"sku":"834224","manufacturer_id":"08-01-01","brand_name":"Switch","product_name":" Switch H-Wall SweptBack Polarized Interchangeable Sunglasses","long_description":"Named for a steep, mogul-strewn black diamond ski run in Tahoe, the Switch H-Wall SweptBack polarized sunglasses help you navigate mountain terrain when light conditions make it tricky. Polarized lenses reduce 99% of visible glare from water, snow, sand and pavement for increased visual acuity and decreased eye strain. Switch interchangeable system uses high-energy embedded magnets, so lenses jump into place when brought near the frames. Magnets are engineered to stay in place when subjected to the intense jarring of skiing, snowboarding, running or mountain biking. Superior grade nylon frames offer a consistent fit and flexibility in all temperatures and are extremely impact resistant. Frames include 2 sets of lenses-1 set of polarized, amber-tinted lenses for bright light and 1 set of non-polarized, rose-tinted lenses for low light. Vented nose pads enhance airflow to minimize fogging. Lightweight and virtually shatterproof, polycarbonate lenses are 20 times more impact resistant than glass and one-third the weight. TriGuard(TM) thin-film lens coating is easy to clean, withstands rough handling and causes water to bead up and run off. Magnetic LensPod(TM) keeps your lenses protected in an easy-to-carry, contoured case. Switch H-Wall SweptBack polarized sunglasses also come with a microfiber cleaning pouch. Medium to large fit.","short_description":"Named for a steep, mogul-strewn black diamond ski run in Tahoe, the Switch H-Wall SweptBack polarized sunglasses help you navigate mountain terrain when light conditions make it tricky.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sunglasses","product_group":"Sport Sunglasses","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s423011.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l423011.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=423011&tt=df","keywords":"Cycling","retail_price":"129.00","sale_price":"129.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=423011\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m423011.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=834224&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8342240002":{"sku":"8342240002","vendor_sku":"08-01-01","upc":"813046018744","size":"GREY POLARIZED","color":"MATTE BLACK","retail_price":"129.00","sale_price":"129.00"}}}
