{"sku":"830988","manufacturer_id":"865","brand_name":"La Sportiva","product_name":"La Sportiva Miura VS Rock Shoes - Women's","long_description":"Pull on the La Sportiva Muira VS rock shoes, cinch the rip-and-stick straps and start up a steep climb with great control. The shoes excel when you're edging or sticking your toes in tiny pockets. Shoes have an aggressive cambered shape that is especially effective on small edges and in pockets. 3 rip-and-stick straps on each shoe give you precise control over the fit and let you put the shoes on and take them off quickly. Slip-lasted construction with leather uppers and wicking Dentex synthetic linings offer lasting performance, flexibility and stretch-resistance. Forefeet use 1.1mm Laspoflex midsole supports for effective edging power and reduced foot fatigue. The 4mm Vibram XS Grip2 soles supply incredible friction in all temperatures.","short_description":"Pull on the La Sportiva Muira VS rock shoes, cinch the rip-and-stick straps and start up a steep climb with great control.
