Aluminum frame features an S-bend down tube to optimize suspension performance, handling and fit and maintain strength. Suntour XCM suspension fork provides 80mm of travel to smooth out rough trails; suspension can be locked out. Truvativ triple crankset is paired with a wide-ranging cassette to power the 27 gear combinations, making easy work of conquering hills and technical switchbacks. Shimano Alivio trigger shifters guide the Acera front and Alivio rear derailleurs for responsive, precise shifts. Tektro HDC 300 hydraulic disc brakes provide reliable stopping power and controlled deceleration. Mineral oil system in the hydraulic disc brakes performs consistently in all conditions and is a great alternative to DOT chemical fluid systems. Weinmann rims use double-wall construction for strength and are decked out with WTB Nano Comp tires for excellent traction.
