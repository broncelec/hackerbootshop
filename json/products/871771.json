Bag has a temperature rating of 15degF for comfort in cold conditions. Bag is designed for women, with a narrow cut at the shoulders, more width at the hips and extra insulation in the footbox and torso where it's needed most. Underside insulation has been eliminated and replaced with a sleeve for a Big Agnes 20 in. wide rectangular pad (not included). Modified mummy bag features short staple synthetic insulation with 97% recycled content that provides high loft, superior warmth-to-weight ratio and excellent compressibility. Ripstop nylon shell is treated with a durable water repellent finish; soft, breathable nylon taffeta lining cocoons you in comfort. Comes with a 2-way, full-length, locking zipper with big, easy-to-grab zipper pull. Large draft tube located behind the zipper prevents warm air from escaping and cold air from entering. Pillow pocket allows you to stuff extra clothing or a travel pillow inside; interior fabric loops stabilize a sleeping bag liner (not included). The Big Agnes Lulu Women's Petite Sleeping Bag includes a nylon stuff sack and large cotton storage bag.","short_description":"With quick-drying synthetic insulation to handle cold, damp weather, the Big Agnes Lulu Women's Petite Sleeping Bag is sized just right for women 5' 6\" and shorter.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags And Accessories","product_group":"Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s421971.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l421971.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=421971&tt=df","keywords":"compact","retail_price":"159.95","sale_price":"119.73","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=421971\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m421971.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=871771&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8717710002":{"sku":"8717710002","vendor_sku":"BWLUPR11","upc":"487177100021","size":"Petite Right","color":"RASPBERRY/GRAY","retail_price":"119.73","sale_price":"119.73"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sleeping-bags-and-accessories","sleeping-bags"]}
