Dual cooking surfaces enable open-air grilling and stove-top heating at the same time; independent burner controls allow total command of heat output. PerfectFlow(TM) propane pressure control system regulates fuel flow for constant output and steady temperature. Adjustable burners kick out 10,000 BTUs each to get your cooking done in short order. WindBlock(TM) lid and foldout side shields block wind from the burner surface; when folded down, the side shields serve as trays for holding food and utensils. Easy-to-use InstaStart(TM) ignition takes the worry out of remembering matches. Grill grate and stove grate remove for cleaning; removable grease tray eases clean up. Operates on 16.4-oz. propane canisters, sold separately. Due to flammable item shipping restrictions, we cannot sell fuel canisters online; they are available at REI retail stores.
