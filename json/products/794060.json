Ball head accommodates full 360deg pans and 90deg tilt and can support an SLR or camcorder up to 6.6 lbs. Ball head is equipped with a standard 0.25 in. adapter and can be used atop other tripods. Includes a quick-release bubble-level clip that can remain attached to your camera for effortless and speedy setup. Unlike traditional tripods, the Gorillapod SLR-Zoom doesn't require an elevated flat surface for you to take the perfect shot. An adaptable screw (from 0.25 to 0.375 in.) lets you mount a digital SLR or a tripod head of your choosing. Flexible joints bend and rotate 360deg to form the perfect shape. Ring and foot grips work on most surfaces, providing extra holding power.","short_description":"Sporting a ball head, this new Joby Gorillapod SLR-Zoom tripod allows you to easily tilt and rotate your camera.","category":"Electronics","subcategory":"Photography","product_group":"Tripods And Monopods","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s426963.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l426963.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=426963&tt=df","retail_price":"80.00","sale_price":"80.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=426963\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m426963.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=794060&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7940600013":{"sku":"7940600013","vendor_sku":"JB00134-CEN","upc":"854630001346","color":"BLACK/GRAY","retail_price":"80.00","sale_price":"80.00"}},"categories":["electronics","photography","tripods-and-monopods"]}
