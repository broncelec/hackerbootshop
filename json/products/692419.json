{"sku":"692419","manufacturer_id":"CCP-44","brand_name":"Park Tool","product_name":"Park Splined Crank Puller","long_description":"This Park crank puller is designed to remove crank arms from Shimano(R) Octalink spindles and ISIS Drive(R) splined systems. It uses a long, comfortable handle and a fine thread for the leverage needed to remove tight crankarms. Rotating tip ensures smooth operation and long life. Note: Will not work on crank arms that fit square, tapered bottom bracket spindles. Crankarms with a \"one-key release\" system do not use any crank puller tool--the one-key system acts as the remover.","short_description":"This Park crank puller is designed to remove crank arms from Shimano(R) Octalink spindles and ISIS Drive(R) splined systems.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bike Accessories","product_group":"Bike Tools And Maintenance","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s379135.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l379135.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=379135&tt=df","retail_price":"15.50","sale_price":"15.50","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=379135\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m379135.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=692419&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"6924190017":{"sku":"6924190017","vendor_sku":"CCP-44","upc":"763477001436","retail_price":"15.50","sale_price":"15.50"}},"categories":["cycling","bike-accessories","bike-tools-and-maintenance"]}
