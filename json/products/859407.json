{"sku":"859407","manufacturer_id":"FCCW101","brand_name":"Look","product_name":"Look XM 16 L C130 Randonee Bindings - 2013/2014","long_description":"With the feel of alpine bindings and the ability to tour the backcountry, the burly Look XM 16 L C130 randonee bindings let you charge down the steepest lines and climb back up for more. Low binding height, a wide footprint and very high stiffness create the same performance as an alpine binding to give you the confidence to ski the most challenging terrain. Switching from touring mode to ski mode and back again is accomplished with a simple flick of your ski pole and can be done with the skis on your feet. Hard-charging skiers who like to hit jumps and cruise at high speeds will appreciate the adjustable DIN that ranges from 7 to 16. Bindings have a low overall stand height for great stability while skiing. Bindings include 130mm wide brakes to fit your fat powder skis. Flip the climbing bars up with a ski pole to take some stress off your legs when you're skinning uphill; two different positions let you choose the height that works for you. Look XM 16 L C130 randonee bindings fit boot sizes with sole lengths ranging from 305 - 360mm; bindings are only compatible with boots with alpine DIN soles or WTR soles.","short_description":"With the feel of alpine bindings and the ability to tour the backcountry, the burly Look XM 16 L C130 randonee bindings let you charge down the steepest lines and climb back up for more.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Bindings","product_group":"Randonee Ski Bindings","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s381683.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l381683.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=381683&tt=df","retail_price":"449.95","sale_price":"449.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=381683\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m381683.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859407&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8594070001":{"sku":"8594070001","vendor_sku":"FCCW101","color":"BLACK/WHITE","retail_price":"449.95","sale_price":"449.95"}},"categories":["snow","ski-bindings","randonee-ski-bindings"]}
