Yoga-inspired waistband features crossover stretch fabric in front for superior comfort while tucked over the bike. Novara Gel chamois conforms to body contours; a top layer of breathable foam and a bottom layer of thin, resilient foam enhances comfort on the bike. Full-coverage, women-specific Novara Gel chamois features a perforated gel pad to cushion; microfiber cover wicks moisture away. Gel pad system dissipates shock and reduces skin irritation by forming a fluid barrier between the hard saddle shell and the cyclist.

With a UPF 50+ rating, fabric provides excellent protection against harmful ultraviolet rays.","short_description":"As you follow the rolling contours of the road, let Novara Carema women's bike shorts support those hard working legs.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Cycling Clothing","product_group":"Bike Shorts","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s462223.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l462223.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=462223&tt=df","retail_price":"49.50","sale_price":"49.50","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=462223\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m462223.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=809712&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8097120011":{"sku":"8097120011","vendor_sku":"14072","upc":"480971200119","size":"S","color":"Black","retail_price":"49.50","sale_price":"49.50"},"8097120029":{"sku":"8097120029","vendor_sku":"14072","upc":"480971200294","size":"M","color":"Black","retail_price":"49.50","sale_price":"49.50"},"8097120037":{"sku":"8097120037","vendor_sku":"14072","upc":"480971200379","size":"L","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"49.50","sale_price":"49.50"},"8097120045":{"sku":"8097120045","vendor_sku":"14072","upc":"480971200454","size":"Xl","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"49.50","sale_price":"49.50"}},"categories":["cycling","cycling-clothing","bike-shorts"]}
