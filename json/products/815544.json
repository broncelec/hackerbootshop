Durable Cordura(R) nylon shell stands up to the tough love of paddling. Gaia(R) PVC-free foam is soft, flexible and won't break down in a wet environment. Adjustable shoulder straps follow your movement without hindering it. Unique cross-chest cinch strap design eliminates annoying ride up. Hand-beveled foam lends a closer, more feminine fit, and contoured inner cups wrap around body without uncomfortable pressure. Roomy, zippered pockets contain warm, soft fleece and a key keeper. Center-zip design with non-corroding zipper slider allows easy entry. 4-way lash tabs on front and back let you secure accessories such as strobes or knives (not included). Short length won't interfere with seat backs. Reflective accents of the Stohlquist BetSEA PFD enhance visibility in low light.","short_description":"The women-specific design of the Stohlquist BetSEA PFD fits comfortably and maximizes freedom of movement on the water.","category":"Paddling","subcategory":"Pfds","product_group":"Women's Pfds","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s431999.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l431999.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=431999&tt=df","retail_price":"129.95","sale_price":"129.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=431999\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m431999.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=815544&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8155440001":{"sku":"8155440001","vendor_sku":"520246","upc":"053242232563","size":"S/M","color":"SAGE/SAND","retail_price":"129.95","sale_price":"129.95"},"8155440003":{"sku":"8155440003","vendor_sku":"520248","upc":"053242232616","size":"Plus","color":"SAGE/SAND","retail_price":"129.95","sale_price":"129.95"}},"categories":["paddling","pfds","womens-pfds"]}
