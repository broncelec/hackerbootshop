{"sku":"840752","manufacturer_id":"R10100049","brand_name":"Rottefella","product_name":" Rottefella NTN Freedom Telemark Bindings","long_description":"The Rottefella NTN Freedom telemark bindings bring the benefits of NTN to a lightweight binding setup that enables you to tour deep into the backcountry for fresh powder. At 1,500g per pair (3 lbs. 5 oz.), the Freedom bindings are comparable to other telemark bindings, yet they have the benefits of a step-in design and releasability. Step-in design makes the bindings easy to get in and out of-no more bending down to attach heel levers to your boots. Unlike traditional telemark bindings, NTN bindings are symmetrical so you don't need to worry about which ski is for the left foot and which is for the right. Sideways release helps prevent injuries during falls. Free-pivot mode provides resistance-free touring while skinning up hills; flip-up climbing wires reduce fatigue on your legs as you skin up steep hills. Bindings provide great torsional rigidity for immediate energy transfer from boot to ski edge. NTN bindings require NTN-compatible boots (sold separately); such boots do not have the traditional 75mm duckbill, making walking easier. Power Tube spring cartridges create consistent resistance as you drop into a turn; Large bindings come with medium-flexing blue Power Tubes installed. Small bindings come with soft-flexing green Power Tubes installed. You can install green (soft), blue (medium) and red (stiff) cartridges (not included) for a desired flex. Rottefella NTN Freedom telemark bindings include 110mm ski brakes that fit most powder skis. Large bindings fit Garmont NTN boot sizes 26 mondo and up; fit Scarpa and Crispi NTN boot sizes 26.5 mondo and up. Small bindings fit Garmont NTN boot sizes 25.5 mondo and down; fit Scarpa and Crispi NTN boot sizes 26 mondo and down.","short_description":"The Rottefella NTN Freedom telemark bindings bring the benefits of NTN to a lightweight binding setup that enables you to tour deep into the backcountry for fresh powder.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Bindings","product_group":"Telemark Ski Bindings","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s381747.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l381747.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=381747&tt=df","retail_price":"449.95","sale_price":"449.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=381747\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m381747.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=840752&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8407520001":{"sku":"8407520001","vendor_sku":"R10100049","size":"S","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"449.95","sale_price":"449.95"}},"categories":["snow","ski-bindings","telemark-ski-bindings"]}
