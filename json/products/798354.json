{"sku":"798354","manufacturer_id":"400069","brand_name":"Black Diamond","product_name":"Black Diamond Contact Strap Crampons with ABS Plates","long_description":"Compact and easy to use, the 10-point Black Diamond Contact strap-on crampons are optimized for general mountaineering, backcountry skiing and glacier walking. Now constructed using stainless steel for a design that won't rust, crampons are lighter weight and more durable than previous version; stainless steel resists snow balling. Low profile creates a secure connection to modern climbing boots. Horizontal front points provide excellent stability on snow and glaciers. Secondary points create a stable platform while kicking steps; serrated points bite into snow and ice for secure hold. Flexible toe straps fit most footwear. Included dual-density ABS plates keep snow from sticking beneath your feet. Boots size 12 and larger require the Long Center Bars, sold separately.","short_description":"Compact and easy to use, the 10-point Black Diamond Contact strap-on crampons are optimized for general mountaineering, backcountry skiing and glacier walking.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Mountaineering Gear","product_group":"Crampons","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s407491.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l407491.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=407491&tt=df","retail_price":"129.95","sale_price":"129.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=407491\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m407491.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=798354&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7983540019":{"sku":"7983540019","vendor_sku":"400069","upc":"793661128526","color":"STAINLESS","retail_price":"129.95","sale_price":"129.95"}},"categories":["climbing","mountaineering-gear","crampons"]}
