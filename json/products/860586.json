{"sku":"860586","manufacturer_id":"313263","brand_name":"Dalbello","product_name":"Dalbello Aspire 75 Ski Boots - Women's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Designed for comfort and fun with a roomy fit and warm liners, the novice-level Dalbello Aspire 75 ski boots for women will help you hone your skills as you enjoy your days on the mountain. Women-specific fit is designed for your feet and calves; fabrics and extra insulation are selected for their softness and warmth. 105mm footbeds offer a very comfortable fit that you can ski all day long. Shells feature 2 differing densities fused into a single design: hard shell offers control and support, and soft shell enhances fit and comfort. Soft shell material over instep makes it easy to get your foot in and out of the boots. Soft, warm, and supportive liners are shaped specifically for women's feet, with tapered heels, roomy forefeet, high insteps and low-profile cuffs. Aspire 75 ski boots feature cuff inserts that, when removed, increase the circumference of the boot tops and boost the comfort of your calves. Ski/Walk mechanisms soften the flex of the boots while you're headed toward the lift and increase the flex when you're carving turns down the hill. With a soft flex index, Dalbello Aspire 75 ski boots offer light resistance against a forward lean, appropriate for novice skiers.","short_description":"Designed for comfort and fun with a roomy fit and warm liners, the novice-level Dalbello Aspire 75 ski boots for women will help you hone your skills as you enjoy your days on the mountain.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Downhill Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382655.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382655.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382655&tt=df","retail_price":"249.95","sale_price":"199.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382655\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382655.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=860586&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8605860001":{"sku":"8605860001","vendor_sku":"313263","upc":"616438303493","size":"Mondo 23.5","color":"BLACK TRANSPARENT/WHITE","retail_price":"199.93","sale_price":"199.93"},"8605860003":{"sku":"8605860003","vendor_sku":"313263","upc":"616438303530","size":"Mondo 25.5","color":"BLACK TRANSPARENT/WHITE","retail_price":"199.93","sale_price":"199.93"},"8605860004":{"sku":"8605860004","vendor_sku":"313263","upc":"616438303554","size":"Mondo 26.5","color":"BLACK TRANSPARENT/WHITE","retail_price":"199.93","sale_price":"199.93"},"8605860005":{"sku":"8605860005","vendor_sku":"313263","upc":"616438303578","size":"Mondo 27.5","color":"BLACK TRANSPARENT/WHITE","retail_price":"199.93","sale_price":"199.93"}},"categories":["snow","ski-boots","downhill-ski-boots"]}
