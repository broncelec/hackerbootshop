RC Combi / Skate boots offer good torsional support while remaining flexible for easy kicking and gliding motion. Lightweight hinged stabilizing cuffs provide side-to-side support while allowing good freedom of movement front to back. Rip-and-stick ankle straps allow you to personalize and secure the fit around the cuffs and help hold feet in place. External heel cups support and stabilize the heels and counter pronation and supination; slippery fabric inside the heels reduces friction on entry. NNN outsoles have a torsional rigidity optimized for comfortable skate skiing; medium-flex platforms and a snug fit provide comfort and efficient boot-to-ski power transfer. Easy entry loops and wide openings reduce on-and-off effort needed; slippery fabric inside the heels reduces friction on entry. Highly water-resistant lace covers with sealed zippers ensure moisture is kept out. EVA foam cushioning inside the Fischer RC3 Skate boots provides warmth and comfort; after several days of skiing, the linings comfortably conform to your feet.","short_description":"The Fischer RC3 Combi/Skate boots offer stability, control and easy entry for race newcomers who want the flexibility of a boot that can be used for both classic and skate skiing.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Boots","product_group":"Cross-Country Ski Boots","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382403.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382403.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382403&tt=df","retail_price":"179.95","sale_price":"161.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382403\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382403.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859276&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8592760001":{"sku":"8592760001","vendor_sku":"S01213,41","size":"41 EU","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"161.93","sale_price":"161.93"},"8592760002":{"sku":"8592760002","vendor_sku":"S01213,42","size":"42 EU","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"161.93","sale_price":"161.93"},"8592760003":{"sku":"8592760003","vendor_sku":"S01213,43","size":"43 EU","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"161.93","sale_price":"161.93"},"8592760004":{"sku":"8592760004","vendor_sku":"S01213,44","size":"44 EU","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"161.93","sale_price":"161.93"},"8592760005":{"sku":"8592760005","vendor_sku":"S01213,45","size":"45 EU","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"161.93","sale_price":"161.93"},"8592760006":{"sku":"8592760006","vendor_sku":"S01213,46","size":"46 EU","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"161.93","sale_price":"161.93"},"8592760007":{"sku":"8592760007","vendor_sku":"S01213,47","size":"47 EU","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"161.93","sale_price":"161.93"},"8592760008":{"sku":"8592760008","vendor_sku":"S01213,48","size":"48 EU","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"161.93","sale_price":"161.93"}},"categories":["snow","ski-boots","crosscountry-ski-boots"]}
