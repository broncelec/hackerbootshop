{"sku":"830412","manufacturer_id":"53349","brand_name":"Camelbak","product_name":" CamelBak eddy Water Bottle - 20 fl. oz.","long_description":"Enjoy spill-proof sipping at work or on the trail with the 20 fl. oz. CamelBak eddy(TM) water bottle. Redesigned cap and Big Bite valve provide faster flow than previous versions; just bite and sip, and your beverage flows through the valve. Made of Eastman Tritan(TM) copolyester, the bottle is completely BPA-free and is dishwasher safe. Tritan copolyester provides excellent impact resistance and is suitable for both warm and cold beverages. But if lifting and tipping is your preferred method, no problem; just remove the straw inside. Carry the integrated handle in the crook of a finger, or connect it to a pack or waistbelt with a small carabiner (not included). Simply unscrew the cap to uncover bottle's wide-mouth opening for easy filling and cleaning; opening is compatible with standard 63mm caps, filters and accessories. Sleek shape fits easily in your hand is compatible with most car cup holders. All CamelBak eddy water bottle components are dishwasher safe (top rack only); do not microwave. CamelBak does not recommend the use of carbonated beverages with the straw configuration; remove straw and drink by tipping and sipping.","short_description":"Enjoy spill-proof sipping at work or on the trail with the 20 fl. oz.
