{"sku":"847649","manufacturer_id":"N5413713LR","brand_name":"Kelty","product_name":" Kelty Cosmic Down 21 Sleeping Bag","long_description":"Turning the brrrrr into ahhhhh, the Kelty Cosmic Down 21degF sleeping bag warms you from head to toe, and from spring to fall in the high country. Soft, high-loft 550-fill-power duck down insulation provides exceptional warmth and light weight. Baffle construction with differential cut eliminates cold spots; inner layer is cut smaller than the outer layer to create consistent thickness of insulation. Polyester taffeta creates a smooth yet durable shell; polyester taffeta lining breathes for comfort and feels great against skin. Top baffle draft collar drapes comfortably over neck and shoulders, sealing out drafts. Formfitting hood has drawcords of differing widths at head and neck for easy identification and adjustment in the dark. Ground-level side seam keeps draft tube in place, further helping prevent cold air from seeping through the 2-way, locking zipper. Internal loops provide attachment for a liner (sold separately) to increase the warmth of the bag. Pad loops provide attachment points to keep your sleeping bag and pad together, so you needn't worry about rolling onto the cold, hard ground (straps sold separately). Hang loops allow easy drying and storage. Kelty Cosmic Down 21degF sleeping bag comes with a stuff sack.","short_description":"Turning the brrrrr into ahhhhh, the Kelty Cosmic Down 21degF sleeping bag warms you from head to toe, and from spring to fall in the high country.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags And Accessories","product_group":"Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s421447.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l421447.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=421447&tt=df","keywords":"compact","retail_price":"189.95","sale_price":"189.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=421447\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m421447.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=847649&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8476490003":{"sku":"8476490003","vendor_sku":"N5413713LR","upc":"727880038779","size":"Long Right","color":"CHILI PEPPER","retail_price":"189.95","sale_price":"189.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sleeping-bags-and-accessories","sleeping-bags"]}
