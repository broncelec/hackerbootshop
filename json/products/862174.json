Synapse aluminum frame is built to give riders great handling, stability and steering precision in a more comfortable, upright position than race-oriented road frames. The rear part of the frame and the carbon-bladed fork feature the Cannondale Synapse Active Vibration Elimination (S.A.V.E.) technology for damping road vibration. Drivetrain features an FSA Omega compact crankset and Shimano Tiagra components for dependable shifts throughout the 20 gears. Compact gearing offers a wide range of gear ratios so you can spin up hills and cruise the plateaus. Schwalbe Lugano tires supply low rolling-resistance and grippy handling. Cannondale components outfit the cockpit, including a Stage Ergo saddle for support and comfort; pedals sold separately. Specs on the Cannondale Synapse Alloy 6 Compact road bike are subject to change.","short_description":"The Cannondale Synapse Alloy 6 Compact road bike combines a comfort-enhancing frame with Shimano Tiagra parts for efficient performance during long-distance rides.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bikes","product_group":"Road Bikes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s374647.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l374647.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=374647&tt=df","retail_price":"1159.00","sale_price":"1159.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=374647\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m374647.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=862174&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8621740003":{"sku":"8621740003","vendor_sku":"CM21625602","upc":"884603507704","size":"56 CM","color":"JET BLACK MATTE","retail_price":"1159.00","sale_price":"1159.00"},"8621740004":{"sku":"8621740004","vendor_sku":"CM21625802","upc":"884603507711","size":"58 CM","color":"JET BLACK MATTE","retail_price":"1159.00","sale_price":"1159.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bikes","road-bikes"]}
