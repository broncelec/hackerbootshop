{"sku":"866710","manufacturer_id":"GIJL1215","brand_name":"Gibbon","product_name":" Gibbon Jibline X13 Slackline - 49 ft.","long_description":"The Gibbon Jibline X13 Slackline features trampoline-style webbing that's thin and dynamic to maximize your power for jumps and tricks on the line. Consisting of only 2 parts, the Gibbon Jibline X13 Slackline kit can be quickly rigged between 2 trees and set up at a length from 10 ft. to 49 ft. X13 slackline is 1.5 ft. longer on the ratchet side than the standard Gibbon Jibline Slackline, letting you set up around bigger trees; also includes a pad for the ratchet. 2 in. wide webbing can be mounted just a couple feet off the ground; webbing features rubber-based prints to add grip. Integrated ratchet lets you set the tension just right: keep it loose for lots of bounce or tighten it up some for more stability. Gibbon Jibline X13 Slackline kit includes slackline, ratchet and instruction manual.","short_description":"The Gibbon Jibline X13 Slackline features trampoline-style webbing that's thin and dynamic to maximize your power for jumps and tricks on the line.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Webbing And Cords","product_group":"Slacklines","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s407743.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l407743.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=407743&tt=df","retail_price":"85.00","sale_price":"85.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=407743\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m407743.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=866710&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8667100001":{"sku":"8667100001","vendor_sku":"GIJL1215","size":"49 FT","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"85.00","sale_price":"85.00"}}}
