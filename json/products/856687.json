{"sku":"856687","manufacturer_id":"20156-1","brand_name":"Saucony","product_name":" Saucony Ride 6 Road-Running Shoes - Men's","long_description":"The Saucony Ride 6 road-running shoes serve up plenty of comfort to neutral runners thanks to the highly breathable uppers and cushioned midsoles. Breathable nylon mesh uppers feature synthetic leather overlays for light support. Nylon linings and plush collars breathe well, wick moisture and dry quickly to keep your feet cool and comfortable. Breathable insoles are constructed from open-cell foam to provide plenty of cushioning underfoot; antimicrobial treatment deters odors. Responsive, dual-density EVA midsoles maintain rebound over the miles; strobel board construction increases cushioning and comfort. Thermoplastic urethane shanks control torsional flex at midfoot for light arch support. Special impact zones cushion heel and forefoot impact while setting foot for a smooth transition. 8mm heel-to-toe drop encourages a short, low-impact stride. Outsoles on the Saucony Ride 6 shoes use blown rubber under forefeet for cushioning and flex; carbon rubber at heels delivers traction and durability.","short_description":"The Saucony Ride 6 road-running shoes serve up plenty of comfort to neutral runners thanks to the highly breathable uppers and cushioned midsoles.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Men's Footwear","product_group":"Men's Shoes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s385899.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l385899.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=385899&tt=df","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=385899\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m385899.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=856687&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8566870001":{"sku":"8566870001","vendor_sku":"20156-1","upc":"720026520497","size":"8","color":"GREY/GREEN/CITRON","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"8566870002":{"sku":"8566870002","vendor_sku":"20156-1","upc":"720026520503","size":"8.5","color":"GREY/GREEN/CITRON","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"8566870003":{"sku":"8566870003","vendor_sku":"20156-1","upc":"720026520510","size":"9","color":"GREY/GREEN/CITRON","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"8566870004":{"sku":"8566870004","vendor_sku":"20156-1","upc":"720026520527","size":"9.5","color":"GREY/GREEN/CITRON","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"8566870005":{"sku":"8566870005","vendor_sku":"20156-1","upc":"720026520534","size":"10","color":"GREY/GREEN/CITRON","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"8566870006":{"sku":"8566870006","vendor_sku":"20156-1","upc":"720026520541","size":"10.5","color":"GREY/GREEN/CITRON","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"8566870007":{"sku":"8566870007","vendor_sku":"20156-1","upc":"720026520558","size":"11","color":"GREY/GREEN/CITRON","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"8566870008":{"sku":"8566870008","vendor_sku":"20156-1","upc":"720026520565","size":"11.5","color":"GREY/GREEN/CITRON","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"8566870009":{"sku":"8566870009","vendor_sku":"20156-1","upc":"720026520572","size":"12","color":"GREY/GREEN/CITRON","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"8566870010":{"sku":"8566870010","vendor_sku":"20156-1","upc":"720026520596","size":"13","color":"GREY/GREEN/CITRON","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"},"8566870011":{"sku":"8566870011","vendor_sku":"20156-1","upc":"720026520602","size":"14","color":"GREY/GREEN/CITRON","retail_price":"110.00","sale_price":"110.00"}},"categories":["footwear","mens-footwear","mens-shoes"]}
