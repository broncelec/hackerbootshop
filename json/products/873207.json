{"sku":"873207","manufacturer_id":"RH1WS05","brand_name":"Rossignol","product_name":" Rossignol BC 65 Positrack Backcountry Skis","long_description":"The Rossignol BC 65 Positrack Backcountry Skis are lightweight, metal edge touring skis designed for off-trail exploring or on-trail use. Designed primarily for off-trail light backcountry use, but will track nicely on-trail as well (for those spending about 70% of their time off-trail and 30% on-trail). Wood with air channel core construction creates structural spines, adding torsional rigidity while reducing weight. Waxless Positrack bases provide maximum grip and a good compromise between kick and glide in all snow conditions. Rossignol BC 65 Positrack Backcountry Skis have full-length metal edges and a taller camber height than some backcountry skis for off- and on-trail versatility.","short_description":"The Rossignol BC 65 Positrack Backcountry Skis are lightweight, metal edge touring skis designed for off-trail exploring or on-trail use.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Cross-Country Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s381911.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l381911.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=381911&tt=df","retail_price":"244.95","sale_price":"182.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=381911\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m381911.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=873207&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8732070001":{"sku":"8732070001","vendor_sku":"RH1WS05","size":"165 CM","color":"BLUE","retail_price":"182.93","sale_price":"182.93"},"8732070002":{"sku":"8732070002","vendor_sku":"RH1WS05","size":"175 CM","color":"BLUE","retail_price":"182.93","sale_price":"182.93"},"8732070003":{"sku":"8732070003","vendor_sku":"RH1WS05","size":"185 CM","color":"BLUE","retail_price":"182.93","sale_price":"182.93"},"8732070004":{"sku":"8732070004","vendor_sku":"RH1WS05","size":"195 CM","color":"BLUE","retail_price":"182.93","sale_price":"182.93"}}}
