{"sku":"862133","manufacturer_id":"CM2418XL01","brand_name":"Cannondale","product_name":" Cannondale F29 Alloy 4 Bike - 2014","long_description":"Get your stoke on with the Cannondale F29 Alloy 4 hardtail mountain bike, which is built to speed down cross-country trails thanks to an agile frame, 29 in. wheels, Lefty fork and SRAM components. F29 aluminum frame features a geometry that's designed to offer race-inspired, nimble handling; 1.5 in. headtube improves strength, stiffness and handling. Rear stays are shaped to help smooth out trail chatter and enhance rolling speed, acceleration and handling. Lefty 29er fork with Push-Button Rebound (PBR) offers 90mm of smooth, responsive travel and precise handling; easy-access lockout and rebound controls are glove-friendly. Large BB30 bottom bracket design increases stiffness for improved power-transfer. SRAM X7 shifters, x9 Type II rear derailleur and X7 front derailleur quickly guide the chain through the 20 gears of the 2x10 drivetrain. Magura MT2 hydraulic disc brakes provide great feel and progressive, powerful braking, thanks in part to the pairing of a 180mm rotor up front and a 160mm rotor in the back. Stan's ZTR Rapid rims and fast-rolling, corner-hungry Schwalbe Racing Ralph EVO Perfomance tires are tubeless-ready for an easy upgrade. Pedals sold separately. Specs on the Cannondale F29 Alloy 4 hardtail mountain bike are subject to change.","short_description":"Get your stoke on with the Cannondale F29 Alloy 4 hardtail mountain bike, which is built to speed down cross-country trails thanks to an agile frame, 29 in. wheels, Lefty fork and SRAM components.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Bikes","product_group":"Mountain Bikes","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s374859.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l374859.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=374859&tt=df","retail_price":"2499.00","sale_price":"2499.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=374859\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m374859.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=862133&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8621330001":{"sku":"8621330001","vendor_sku":"CM2418SM01","upc":"884603519042","size":"S","color":"MAGNESIUM WHITE GLOSS","retail_price":"2499.00","sale_price":"2499.00"},"8621330002":{"sku":"8621330002","vendor_sku":"CM2418MD01","upc":"884603519059","size":"M","color":"MAGNESIUM WHITE GLOSS","retail_price":"2499.00","sale_price":"2499.00"},"8621330003":{"sku":"8621330003","vendor_sku":"CM2418LG01","upc":"884603519066","size":"L","color":"MAGNESIUM WHITE GLOSS","retail_price":"2499.00","sale_price":"2499.00"},"8621330004":{"sku":"8621330004","vendor_sku":"CM2418XL01","upc":"884603519073","size":"XL","color":"MAGNESIUM WHITE GLOSS","retail_price":"2499.00","sale_price":"2499.00"}},"categories":["cycling","bikes","mountain-bikes"]}
