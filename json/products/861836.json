{"sku":"861836","manufacturer_id":"GD158","brand_name":"Skilogik","product_name":" SKILOGIK Goddess RL Skis - Women's - 2013/2014","long_description":"Built with easy-to-turn rockered tips and wide waists that love soft snow, the women's SKILOGIK Goddess RL skis offer women a beautifully-crafted wood veneer unlike anything else on the mountain. Rockered tips are easy to maneuver and offer excellent flotation in soft snow, and the relatively tight sidecut radius offers the versatility to carve groomers. The Goddess RL skis are sculpted from the same top-end materials as all other SKILOGIK skis, but scaled proportionately to cater to the performance of women skiers. Construction consists of a hardwood core layered in a composite of carbon and fiberglass, topped with an eye-pleasing wood veneer that speaks to beautiful craftsmanship. Complementary wood cores ensure that your left ski and right ski have a matched flex pattern. Black locust hardwood sidewalls offer extra grip. 101mm waists require bindings with wide brakes. Base or topsheet color on the women's SKILOGIK Goddess RL skis may vary from online photo.","short_description":"Built with easy-to-turn rockered tips and wide waists that love soft snow, the women's SKILOGIK Goddess RL skis offer women a beautifully-crafted wood veneer unlike anything else on the mountain.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382339.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382339.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382339&tt=df","retail_price":"750.00","sale_price":"599.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382339\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382339.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=861836&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8618360002":{"sku":"8618360002","vendor_sku":"GD166","upc":"486183600020","size":"166 CM","color":"WHITE/BROWN/GREEN/BLACK","retail_price":"599.93","sale_price":"599.93"},"8618360003":{"sku":"8618360003","vendor_sku":"GD174","upc":"486183600037","size":"174 CM","color":"WHITE/BROWN/GREEN/BLACK","retail_price":"599.93","sale_price":"599.93"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
