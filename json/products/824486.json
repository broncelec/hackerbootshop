Toepiece provides multidirectional release for optimum protection in all types of falls; 4 contact points between the toepieces and the boots ensure effective power transfer. PX 12 wide bindings feature 45mm of elastic travel at the heel, which absorbs shock and allows a lower setting of release values. Anti-friction device reduces sliding between the boot and the binding and keeps release consistent. Look PX 12 XXL downhill ski bindings come with 115mm brakes, which are wide enough to fit many powder skis.","short_description":"The Look PX 12 XXL downhill ski bindings offer the performance needed to charge over the lip into untouched powder without a second thought.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Ski Bindings","product_group":"Downhill Ski Bindings","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s381539.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l381539.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=381539&tt=df","retail_price":"199.95","sale_price":"139.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=381539\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m381539.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=824486&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8244860001":{"sku":"8244860001","vendor_sku":"FC1A019","color":"BLACK CHROME","retail_price":"139.93","sale_price":"139.93"}},"categories":["snow","ski-bindings","downhill-ski-bindings"]}
