{"sku":"860499","manufacturer_id":"SGSCFY-325","brand_name":"Skullcandy","product_name":"Skullcandy Crusher Headphones","long_description":"With dual drivers that let you hear and feel impressive bass, the Skullcandy Crusher headphones serve up a realistic music experience of vibrating deep notes and clear, undistorted sound. Custom-tuned primary driver produces supreme sound with smooth frequency response and minimal distortion. Unlike single-driver units that try to simulate bass with digital signal processing, Crusher features a second driver that triggers a vibration system for bass you can feel. Acoustical porting within the ear cups allows both drivers to move freely, further enhancing bass and reducing distortion. Built-in amplifier does away with the bulky inline amps of old; it draws its power from a user-replaceable AA battery in the ear cup that offers up to 40 hrs. of play time. Bass sensation slider on the left ear cup offers adjustable bass control; quickly choose your preferred level of vibration or turn it completely off. Automatic on/off smart circuit eliminates the need for a power switch; when your music stops or you unplug the headphones, the amp powers down within 10 sec. Once you restore the music source, the amp will automatically power up. Ergonomic flexibility, clamping pressure and soft-touch synthetic leather ear pillows deliver long-lasting comfort and an effective seal around your ears for noise isolation. The Skullcandy Crusher headphones feature a detachable cable, inline mic and fold-down design for portability and storage.","short_description":"With dual drivers that let you hear and feel impressive bass, the Skullcandy Crusher headphones serve up a realistic music experience of vibrating deep notes and clear, undistorted sound.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Camp Electronics","product_group":"Radios And Headphones","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s412843.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l412843.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=412843&tt=df","retail_price":"109.00","sale_price":"109.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=412843\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m412843.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=860499&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8604990001":{"sku":"8604990001","vendor_sku":"S6SCDZ-003","upc":"878615038837","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"},"8604990002":{"sku":"8604990002","vendor_sku":"S6SCFY-059","upc":"878615053939","color":"RED","retail_price":"99.95","sale_price":"99.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","camp-electronics","radios-and-headphones"]}
