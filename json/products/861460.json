{"sku":"861460","manufacturer_id":"A14-262-1-20","brand_name":"Marin","product_name":" Marin Bolinas Ridge Hydro 29er Bike - 2014","long_description":"With the big-wheeled Marin Bolinas Ridge Hydro 29er hardtail mountain bike you can roll over obstacles and tackle sloppy, muddy trails with confidence. Double-butted aluminum frame delivers a stiff, responsive ride; hydroformed top and down tubes maintain strength while reducing overall weight. SR Suntour XCM-HLO-29 suspension fork provides 100mm of travel to smooth out rough trails and can be locked out when suspension isn't needed. Snap through the 27 gear combinations with the Shimano Altus trigger shifters and tackle hilly terrain and fast descents. Tektro HDM-300 Hydraulic Disc brakes facilitate easy speed management as well as outright stopping power thanks to a 180mm rotor up front and a 160mm rotor in the back. Schwalbe Rapid Rob 29 in. tires offer fast-rolling traction with good cornering bite.
