{"sku":"844651","manufacturer_id":"14581","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":" REI Crestrail 70 Pack","long_description":"The REI Crestrail 70 pack incorporates the latest concepts in pack design, materials and components, balancing comfort with performance and durability for weekend or multiday trips. ActivMotion(R) hipbelt pivots to follow the natural motion of your hips, helping balance and stabilize the pack when you're hiking on uneven terrain. Hipbelt webbing tightens with a forward pull for easy adjustment; 2 zippered hipbelt pockets provide handy access to snacks. Sculpted FreeFlow back panel has multiple peaks and valleys that reduce contact areas and allow sweat vapor to escape; soft foam conforms to your back for a stable fit. Tubular aluminum perimeter frame saves weight compared to HDPE/stay framesheets; it moves weight to your hips and stabilizes the pack, helping prevent side-to-side sway. Top-loading main compartment also features 2 zippered access points to the main bag, plus separate zippered access to the sleeping bag compartment. Large zippered front pocket, stretch stash pocket and lightweight lash points store and organize often-used gear; floating top lid expands capacity to hold large loads. Side, bottle-locking pockets secure bottles or other items, helping prevent them from falling out when bushwhacking or taking your pack off. Strategically placed Speed Hook ice axe attachments avoid interference with pockets and access zippers. Top and side compression straps pull the load closer to your back, minimize bulk and create external attachment points for gear. Cordura(R) nylon fabric resists abrasion and tears; Durable Water Resistant finish and water-resistant zippers help keep your contents dry. The REI Crestrail 70 pack's hydration-ready design routes your reservoir's drink tube over either shoulder (hydration reservoir sold separately).","short_description":"The REI Crestrail 70 pack incorporates the latest concepts in pack design, materials and components, balancing comfort with performance and durability for weekend or multiday trips.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Backpacks","product_group":"Backpacking Packs","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s410563.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l410563.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=410563&tt=df","keywords":"multiday","retail_price":"239.00","sale_price":"239.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=410563\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m410563.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=844651&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8446510001":{"sku":"8446510001","vendor_sku":"14581","upc":"484465100015","size":"S","color":"DEEP SEA","retail_price":"239.00","sale_price":"239.00"},"8446510002":{"sku":"8446510002","vendor_sku":"14581","upc":"484465100022","size":"M","color":"DEEP SEA","retail_price":"239.00","sale_price":"239.00"},"8446510003":{"sku":"8446510003","vendor_sku":"14581","upc":"484465100039","size":"L","color":"DEEP SEA","retail_price":"239.00","sale_price":"239.00"}}}
