{"sku":"701171","manufacturer_id":"SWY-BLUE","brand_name":"Fisher Space Pen","product_name":"Fisher Space Pen Stowaway","long_description":"This pen combines a compact, stowaway design with a pressurized ink cartridge that allows the pen to write nearly anywhere, on anything. Pressurized ink cartridge continuously feeds ink to the tungsten carbide ball, allowing pen to write at any angle--even upside down. Visco-elastic ink writes smoothly and dependably on most surfaces, even under water, over fingerprints, in freezing cold, extreme heat and in space! Stainless-steel, precision-machined socket prevents leaks and oozing, yet delivers uniform ink flow. Small, compact design fits almost anywhere; measures 3.75 inches and weighs less than 0.2 ounces. Ink will not dry out for over 100 years. Black ink; medium point. Since 1967, Fisher Space Pens have been used by American astronauts on all manned space flights.","short_description":"This pen combines a compact, stowaway design with a pressurized ink cartridge that allows the pen to write nearly anywhere, on anything.","category":"Lifestyle And Gifts","subcategory":"Journals And Pens","product_group":"Pens","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s430091.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l430091.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=430091&tt=df","retail_price":"9.50","sale_price":"9.50","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=430091\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m430091.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=701171&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7011710014":{"sku":"7011710014","vendor_sku":"SWY-BLACK","upc":"747609340464","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"9.50","sale_price":"9.50"}},"categories":["gifts","journals-and-pens","pens"]}
