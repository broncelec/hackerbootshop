{"sku":"850362","manufacturer_id":"97210","brand_name":"C.A.M.P. Usa","product_name":" C.A.M.P. USA Tricam Evo - 1.0","long_description":"With a new tapered shape, the 1.0-size C.A.M.P. USA Tricam Evo can be placed in 3 different positions (1 active cam and 2 passive chock), making it more likely to fit perfectly in various cracks. Tapered shape of the Tricam Evo allows you to place it in 2 passive chock positions, whereas earlier versions of the Tricam only allow 1 passive chock position. The wider section at the top of the head of the Tricam that creates the taper also lends additional stability when the Tricam is used in cammed placements. Tricam Evo is an excellent piece of gear for protecting horizontal and vertical cracks, whether they're parallel-sided or slightly flaring. Stiff sewing keeps the nylon sling more rigid than on previous versions of the Tricam to make it 1-handed placement and extraction easier. 1.0 size has a range of 21 - 32mm and weighs 37g.","short_description":"With a new tapered shape, the 1.0-size C.A.M.P.
