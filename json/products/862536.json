{"sku":"862536","manufacturer_id":"014633-512-2-M/","brand_name":"Osprey","product_name":"Osprey Talon 33 Pack","long_description":"The updated Osprey Talon 33 pack adds a lighter harness and more comfortable back panel to an already popular design. It excels at done-in-a-day pursuits, from quick trail hikes to alpine assaults. Lightweight Osprey AirScape(TM) back panel features molded foam ridges with air channels and a vertical \"air chimney\" covered in soft, airy mesh for ventilation and comfort. Mesh-covered, die-cut slotted foam BioStretch(TM) shoulder straps and hipbelt offer light and breathable comfort; hipbelt tightens with easy ErgoPull(TM) closure. Harness accommodates a variety of back lengths with an adjustable torso: just rip it, adjust it and stick it. Top-loading main compartment holds lunch, an extra layer of clothes and tools. Hydration compartment opens between the torso adjustment and main pack compartment, making it easily accessible from the outside (reservoir sold separately). Front stretch pocket stashes a jacket, helmet, book or other often-used gear. Two zippered stretch mesh pockets on the hipbelt keep a compact digital camera or snacks at your fingertips. Stretch pockets on the shoulder straps stow a cell phone or GPS, or conveniently secure the end of your hydration tube. The Osprey Talon 33 pack features a rope-carry strap under the top lid, ice-axe attachment points, tow loop and a blinker patch (blinker light sold separately).","short_description":"The updated Osprey Talon 33 pack adds a lighter harness and more comfortable back panel to an already popular design.
