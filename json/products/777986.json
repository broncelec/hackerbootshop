{"sku":"777986","manufacturer_id":"53","brand_name":"Gu","product_name":"GU Roctane Sports Gel","long_description":"It's GU to the next power! Roctane Ultra Endurance energy gel formula contains an amplified blend of nutrients to help you push it on multiple-hour endurance trials. Convenient, easy-to-use squeeze package-simply squeeze into mouth and follow with water. Roctane contains the original GU formula of simple and complex carbohydrates with antioxidants; plus, it enhances performance with histidine, citrates and branched amino acids. Histidine, an essential amino acid, acts as a buffer to slow lactic acid build-up in muscles. Potassium citrate, sodium citrate, and citric acid help speed the conversion of carbohydrates into energy molecules. Branched amino acids leucine, valine and isoleucine serve as an additional fuel source, aid in recovery and help maintain mental focus. Amino acid complex Ornithine Alpha-Ketoglutarate (OKG) limits the body's tendency to break down muscle protein tissue during extremely hard training and racing days. Blueberry Pomegranate, Chocolate Raspberry, Vanilla Orange, Island Nectars and Cherry Lime flavors of Gu Roctane Ultra Endurance energy gel contain 35mg of caffeine. Specifications based on a range of flavors; nutrition facts displayed here and on wrapper may differ; information on wrapper reflects actual contents. *Discount will be applied when you check out. Offer not valid for sale-price items ending in $._3 or $._9.","short_description":"It's GU to the next power!
