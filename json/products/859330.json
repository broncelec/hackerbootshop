{"sku":"859330","manufacturer_id":"S130304101169","brand_name":"K2","product_name":" K2 Press Skis - Men's - 2013/2014","long_description":"With rockered tips and tails and a lightweight, flexible construction designed for tricks, the men's K2 Press skis excel in the terrain park. Lightweight aspen core is strong and durable, and it produces a smooth, natural flex that's suited to tail presses, butters, ollies and other freestyle tricks. A rockered profile designed to tame the terrain park features elevated tips and tails and zero camber underfoot for sliding rails and spinning in the air. A fiberglass weave around the wood core provides torsional stiffness for highly responsive turning. Cap construction contributes to light skis that are easy to maneuver. Directional twin tip heavily favors skiing forward but allows you to ski and land jumps backward if needed. Metal tip plates and tail rivets withstand hard landings. Base or topsheet color on the men's K2 Press skis may vary from online photo.","short_description":"With rockered tips and tails and a lightweight, flexible construction designed for tricks, the men's K2 Press skis excel in the terrain park.","category":"Skiing","subcategory":"Skis","product_group":"Downhill Skis","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s382047.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l382047.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=382047&tt=df","retail_price":"299.95","sale_price":"179.93","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=382047\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m382047.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=859330&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8593300001":{"sku":"8593300001","vendor_sku":"S130304101149","upc":"886745165057","size":"149 CM","retail_price":"179.93","sale_price":"179.93"},"8593300002":{"sku":"8593300002","vendor_sku":"S130304101159","upc":"886745165071","size":"159 CM","retail_price":"179.93","sale_price":"179.93"},"8593300003":{"sku":"8593300003","vendor_sku":"S130304101169","upc":"886745165095","size":"169 CM","retail_price":"179.93","sale_price":"179.93"}},"categories":["snow","skis","downhill-skis"]}
