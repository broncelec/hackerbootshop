PrimaLoft One patented microfiber insulation mimics the physical and thermal properties of goose down, but continues to insulate if wet; it dries quickly, too. Features spandex binding at the armholes. Hem and hood cinch down to keep out drafts. On-seam hand pockets and interior chest pocket all have zip closures. Quilting pattern features Tibetan clouds across the collarbone and sweeping curves at the back. Wear the Sherpa Adventure Gear Maaya vest over a long-sleeve base layer; throw on a shell when you need more warmth.","short_description":"Insulated with lightweight PrimaLoft(R), the Sherpa Adventure Gear Maaya vest will keep your head and core warm, which helps the rest of you feel good, too-especially when you're on the go.","category":"Women's Clothing","subcategory":"Women's Vests","product_group":"Women's Insulated Vests","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s399707.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l399707.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=399707&tt=df","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=399707\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m399707.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=849739&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8497390001":{"sku":"8497390001","vendor_sku":"SW136","upc":"651982054507","size":"XS","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"},"8497390002":{"sku":"8497390002","vendor_sku":"SW136","upc":"651982221916","size":"S","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"},"8497390004":{"sku":"8497390004","vendor_sku":"SW136","upc":"651982221930","size":"L","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"},"8497390005":{"sku":"8497390005","vendor_sku":"SW136","upc":"651982054545","size":"XL","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"},"8497390016":{"sku":"8497390016","vendor_sku":"SW136","upc":"651982221954","size":"XS","color":"BINDI","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"},"8497390017":{"sku":"8497390017","vendor_sku":"SW136","upc":"651982221961","size":"S","color":"BINDI","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"},"8497390018":{"sku":"8497390018","vendor_sku":"SW136","upc":"651982221978","size":"M","color":"BINDI","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"},"8497390019":{"sku":"8497390019","vendor_sku":"SW136","upc":"651982221985","size":"L","color":"BINDI","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"},"8497390020":{"sku":"8497390020","vendor_sku":"SW136","upc":"651982221992","size":"XL","color":"BINDI","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"},"8497390021":{"sku":"8497390021","vendor_sku":"SW136","upc":"651982241709","size":"XS","color":"NEELAM GREEN","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"},"8497390022":{"sku":"8497390022","vendor_sku":"SW136","upc":"651982241716","size":"S","color":"NEELAM GREEN","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"},"8497390023":{"sku":"8497390023","vendor_sku":"SW136","upc":"651982241723","size":"M","color":"NEELAM GREEN","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"},"8497390024":{"sku":"8497390024","vendor_sku":"SW136","upc":"651982241730","size":"L","color":"NEELAM GREEN","retail_price":"130.00","sale_price":"130.00"}},"categories":["womens","womens-vests","womens-insulated-vests"]}
