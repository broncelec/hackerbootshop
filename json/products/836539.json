This warm jacket can be worn as a mid layer or as outerwear in cold climates. It's weather resistant enough to wear as an insulated shell in a wet snowstorm, trim enough to pull on for chilly hikes and warm enough for light parka duty on a snowy day. Versatile PrimaLoft(R) One polyester insulation provides excellent warmth and compressibility. Wind-blocking, moisture-shedding, ripstop polyester shell glides effortlessly whether worn as a middle or outer layer; shell fabric is 70% recycled. Quilt pattern holds insulation in place promoting durability and longevity; Deluge(TM) Durable Water Repellent finish repels moisture. Full-length zipper with internal draft flap, elasticized cuffs and drawcord hem seal out wind and trap warmth. Patagonica Nano Puff packs down to practically nothing and stuffs into the internal zip chest pocket (includes a carabiner clip-in loop); 2 zip handwarmer pockets. Regular fit eases layering. 100% recyclable through Patagonia's Common Threads Recycling Program-simply return your worn-out item to Patagonia.","short_description":"The Patagonia Nano Puff jacket for boys is wind- and water-resistant and highly compressible.
