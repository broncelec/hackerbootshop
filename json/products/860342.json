{"sku":"860342","manufacturer_id":"29750 00003","brand_name":"Ortovox","product_name":" Ortovox 3+ RECCO Avalanche Rescue Kit","long_description":"Get the gear needed for backcountry travel with the Ortovox Avalanche Rescue kit. It includes the Ortovox 3+ RECCO(R) avalanche transceiver, the Beast avalanche shovel and the 240 Light PFA probe. 3+ RECCO has the ability to analyze its vertical orientation when buried and transmit its signal on the transmitting antenna best positioned for searchers to pick up a signal. Most transceivers can only transmit on one antenna; by being able to transmit on two antennas, the 3+ has a consistent 40m range no matter what position it is buried in. The third antenna in the 3+ allows excellent precision and pinpoint search capabilities when you're zeroing in on a buried victim. Upon reaching a victim, the searcher can press the single button to mark the found victim and immediately set out for other snow burials by simply following the visual data. Internal RECCO reflector brings peace of mind by offering a backup means for finding a buried victim; more than 700 ski areas and rescue teams around the world use RECCO. RECCO reflector enhances radio signals from search-and-rescue RECCO detectors, helping speed up the search for a buried avalanche victim. Adjustable harness with case keeps the 3+ RECCO secure and accessible; operates on 1 AA battery. Sturdy Beast telescopic shovel weighs only 710g (1 lb. 9 oz.); 5052 aluminum blade and 6061 aluminum T6 shaft stand up to regular use. Shovel handle extends to 86cm (34 in.) to ease shoveling; compacts to 43cm (17 in.) to fit in your pack while touring. 240 Light PFA probe assembles quickly and weighs only 270g (9.5 oz.); centimeter markings on the probe help you determine depth of a burial. Probe is 240cm (7 ft. 10 in.) long when assembled; collapses down to 45cm (1 ft. 5 in.) for easy storage in a backpack. The Ortovox 3+ RECCO Avalanche Rescue kit also includes a Safety Academy Guide Book with tips on how to properly use your transceiver, shovel and probe.","short_description":"Get the gear needed for backcountry travel with the Ortovox Avalanche Rescue kit.
