{"sku":"858563","manufacturer_id":"10439100962","brand_name":"Burton","product_name":" Burton Ruler Snowboard Boots - 2013/2014","long_description":"Burton Ruler snowboard boots will handle the entire mountain. With stabilizing backstays, oversize airbag cushions and Speed Zone(TM) lacing, these boots give you a comfortable, dialed-in fit. Powerful backstay spines increase both medial and lateral support, edge-to-edge response and durability. Strategically placed flex notches allow smooth, fluid lateral and medial flex, perfect for nose bones and tweaked out tail grabs. Streamlined Speed Zone shell lacing lets you fine-tune the upper and lower zones in seconds; this system offers powerful rebound, wrap and response with minimal effort. To make entry and exit easy, Burton added a pull loop on the tongue as well as a lace pull tab that releases both the upper and lower zones simultaneously. Imprint(TM) 2 liners feature soft faux-fur linings and rip-and-stick closures for a comfortable, close fit. Medium-flexing, slim, 3D-molded tongues wrap your forefeet in comfort, offer a seamless flex and reduce performance-robbing shell/liner stack-up. Snowproof internal gussets on boot tongues completely seal lower boot zones to keep feet warm and dry. Shock-absorbing air bags cover approximately 75% of the midsoles for a pillowy ride and protection without the weight. Grippy rubber spikes supply that extra edge when traveling across slippery terrain. Shrinkage(TM) technology reduces boot's overall footprint by 1 full size, minimizing boot overhang, bulk and weight.","short_description":"Burton Ruler snowboard boots will handle the entire mountain.
