{"sku":"752125","manufacturer_id":"7406","brand_name":"Superfeet","product_name":"Superfeet Orange Premium Insoles - Men's Medium to High Volume","long_description":"These men-specific Superfeet(R) insoles align and control the motion of your feet, providing balance, support and shock absorption for hiking and other active sports. Orange insoles are made for those who stand for long periods of time or are active and feel any foot soreness after activity or a long day. High-volume insoles take up extra volume in footwear, making them ideal for loose-fitting shoes or narrow feet. Topsheets are treated with Agion(TM) to help control odor. Full-length closed-cell foam provides cushioning, while 3/4-length polypropylene heel caps stabilize feet inside boots. Deep heel pockets, rockered bottoms and strategically placed forefoot shock pads allow for natural shock absorption. Superfeet recommends this style for use in footwear with removable insoles; also suitable for Gore-Tex(R) footwear.","short_description":"These men-specific Superfeet(R) insoles align and control the motion of your feet, providing balance, support and shock absorption for hiking and other active sports.","category":"Footwear","subcategory":"Footwear Accessories","product_group":"Insoles","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s376623.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l376623.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=376623&tt=df","keywords":"shoe inserts","retail_price":"44.95","sale_price":"44.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=376623\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m376623.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=752125&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"7521250071":{"sku":"7521250071","vendor_sku":"7408","upc":"086301574082","size":"D (7.5-9)","color":"Orange","retail_price":"44.95","sale_price":"44.95"},"7521250089":{"sku":"7521250089","vendor_sku":"7410","upc":"086301574105","size":"E (9.5-11)","color":"Orange","retail_price":"44.95","sale_price":"44.95"},"7521250097":{"sku":"7521250097","vendor_sku":"7412","upc":"086301574129","size":"F (11.5-13)","color":"Orange","retail_price":"44.95","sale_price":"44.95"},"7521250105":{"sku":"7521250105","vendor_sku":"7414","upc":"086301574143","size":"G (13.5-15)","color":"Orange","retail_price":"44.95","sale_price":"44.95"}},"categories":["footwear","footwear-accessories","insoles"]}
