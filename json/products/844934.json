{"sku":"844934","manufacturer_id":"84935","brand_name":"Patagonia","product_name":" Patagonia Torrentshell Plus Rain Jacket - Men's","long_description":"The Patagonia Torrentshell Plus Jacket is a durable full-featured waterproof, breathable rain jacket built for rugged excursions. Abrasion-resistant 2.5-layer nylon ripstop panels across shoulders and sides add durability where you need it most. 2-way adjustable, helmet-compatible hood doesn't inhibit your view, rolls down and stows away when it's not needed. Adjustable drawcord hem and rip-and-stick cuff closures keep the wet stuff out. All zippers, including pit zips, are watertight. Full-length front zipper has an interior stormflap. Handwarmer pockets; stuff jacket into one of the handwarmer pockets and use the carabiner clip-in loop when you want it close by. Nice touches: microfleece-lined neck; internal mesh pocket.","short_description":"The Patagonia Torrentshell Plus Jacket is a durable full-featured waterproof, breathable rain jacket built for rugged excursions.","category":"Men's Clothing","subcategory":"Men's Jackets","product_group":"Men's Rain Jackets","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s401911.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l401911.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=401911&tt=df","keywords":"hardshell","retail_price":"169.00","sale_price":"169.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=401911\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m401911.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=844934&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{},"extended_xml_attributes":"\n\t\t\t\n\t\t"}
