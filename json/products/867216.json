{"sku":"867216","manufacturer_id":"ME-000731 / ME0","brand_name":"Mountain Equipment","product_name":"Mountain Equipment Matrix I Sleeping Bag","long_description":"Built for backpackers who travel rain or shine, the Mountain Equipment Matrix I Sleeping Bag combines synthetic and down insulation for warmth down to about 35degF. Insulated with high-loft, water-resistant 725-fill-power duck down on top of the sleeping bag for warmth, light weight and compressibility. PrimaLoft(R) Synergy synthetic insulation on the bottom works a lot like down, but performs better than down when exposed to wet weather. With a lower-limit European Norm (EN) rating of 35degF, the Matrix I is a versatile bag for lightweight adventures into the mountains. Downproof and wind-resistant, the densely woven synthetic shell is lightweight, compressible and tough; silky soft lining is also downproof and highly breathable. Durable Water Repellent finish on shell causes water to bead up and roll off. 4-baffle trapezoid footbox is wide in toe area and narrow at the heels for comfort that does not compromise warmth. Protecting the head and neck, the hood features 5 baffles and an anatomic fit to provide warmth and low weight. Alpine Fit features a semi-tapered mummy profile with a tapered lower leg section to maximize warmth and minimize weight without restrictiveness. Single antisnag draft tube (along the 3/4 length zipper) and semi-floating neck collar drape comfortably, blocking the escape of heat and sealing out drafts. Mountain Equipment Matrix I sleeping bag comes with a lightweight stuff sack and mesh storage bag. European Norm (EN) is an independent third-party temperature rating, allowing accurate comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags.","short_description":"Built for backpackers who travel rain or shine, the Mountain Equipment Matrix I Sleeping Bag combines synthetic and down insulation for warmth down to about 35degF.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Sleeping Bags And Accessories","product_group":"Sleeping Bags","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s421811.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l421811.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=421811&tt=df","keywords":"compact","retail_price":"280.00","sale_price":"280.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=421811\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m421811.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=867216&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8672160001":{"sku":"8672160001","vendor_sku":"ME-000731 / ME0","size":"Regular Left","color":"GREEN SHOOTS/TRUE RED","retail_price":"250.00","sale_price":"250.00"},"8672160002":{"sku":"8672160002","vendor_sku":"ME-000731 / ME0","size":"Long Left","color":"GREEN SHOOTS/TRUE RED","retail_price":"280.00","sale_price":"280.00"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","sleeping-bags-and-accessories","sleeping-bags"]}
