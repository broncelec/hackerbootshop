{"sku":"852113","manufacturer_id":"E-CS585HA","brand_name":"Esbit","product_name":"Esbit Solid Fuel Stove and Cookset","long_description":"The Esbit Solid Fuel stove and cookset is a great choice for heating up water or making simple meals on fast and light adventures in the mountains. Hard-anodized aluminum pot and stove are very lightweight-combined, they tip the scales at only 7 oz. Stove is powered by Esbit solid fuel tablets (sold separately); each tablet burns for approximately 12 minutes. Tablets easily light with a match or lighter, and they can be extinguished and saved for reuse. Stove has a built-in windshield for great performance when you're camped high in the mountains. When not in use, the stove stows neatly inside the pot for convenient packing. 20 fl. oz. pot has graduations in both ounces and milliliters that you can read from the inside while you're pouring liquid; small spout on the pot eases pouring. Folding handles on the pot are coated in silicone to protect your hands from heat. Esbit Solid Fuel stove and cookset includes a mesh stuff sack.","short_description":"The Esbit Solid Fuel stove and cookset is a great choice for heating up water or making simple meals on fast and light adventures in the mountains.","category":"Camping And Hiking","subcategory":"Camp Kitchen","product_group":"Stoves","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s416611.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l416611.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=416611&tt=df","retail_price":"29.95","sale_price":"29.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=416611\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m416611.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=852113&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8521130001":{"sku":"8521130001","vendor_sku":"E-CS585HA","retail_price":"29.95","sale_price":"29.95"}},"categories":["camping-hiking","camp-kitchen","stoves"]}
