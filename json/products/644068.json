{"sku":"644068","manufacturer_id":"B01","brand_name":"Petzl","product_name":"Petzl Tibloc Ascender","long_description":"This ultralight, multi-purpose rope grab is an ideal back-up for standard ascenders or for those who wish to travel as light as possible. Much lighter and more compact than standard ascenders, plus faster to set up than prusik knots and works well in pulley systems. Tibloc should be used only with carabiners made of uniform oval or round stock in order to prevent damage to the rope. Caution: hot-forged carabiners with T-shaped stock, such as the Petzl Spirit, should NOT be used. The Tibloc is an amazing little tool when used properly, but can easily be misused; it is essential to read the instructions to prevent rope damage!","short_description":"This ultralight, multi-purpose rope grab is an ideal back-up for standard ascenders or for those who wish to travel as light as possible.","category":"Climbing","subcategory":"Climbing Hardware","product_group":"Ascenders And Descenders","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s380083.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l380083.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=380083&tt=df","keywords":"rappel,belay","retail_price":"32.95","sale_price":"32.95","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=380083\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m380083.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=644068&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"6440680012":{"sku":"6440680012","vendor_sku":"B01","retail_price":"32.95","sale_price":"32.95"}},"categories":["climbing","climbing-hardware","ascenders-and-descenders"]}
