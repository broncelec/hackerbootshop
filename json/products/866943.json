{"sku":"866943","manufacturer_id":"S4BBESLOY","brand_name":"Ticla","product_name":" Ticla Besito Sleeping Bag","long_description":"Don't settle for constricting, sweaty and boring options for sleeping under the stars. The synthetic Ticla Besito Sleeping Bag lets you slumber in luxury and comfort on mild-weather car-camping trips. Flip it! If it's balmy out, sleep with the warmer side of the Besito Sleeping Bag down; when there's a nip in the air, flip it over for a little extra insulation. Besito Sleeping Bag has hollow-core synthetic insulation that is rated to keep you warm down to about 30degF with the warmer side up and 45degF with the warmer side down. Soft polyester lining feels great next to skin; tapered shape keeps your feet warm without restricting them. 2-way zipper lets your feet be free and get some air; unzip the bag all the way for use as a comforter. Packs up without a fuss using the roomy Get Out Of Dodge (G.O.O.D.) System storage bag. G.O.O.D. bag is designed to hold a slightly deflated Tsubo sleeping pad (sold separately) around a loosely stuffed Besito bag, with room for your pillow, headlmap and book. Ticla Besito Sleeping Bag also comes with a sleeping bag stuff sack.","short_description":"Don't settle for constricting, sweaty and boring options for sleeping under the stars.
