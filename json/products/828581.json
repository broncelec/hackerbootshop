{"sku":"828581","manufacturer_id":"11211208027S","brand_name":"Pearl Izumi","product_name":" Pearl Izumi Attack Bike Shorts - Women's","long_description":"A perennial favorite of the weekend warrior, the women's Pearl Izumi Attack bike shorts provide function and durability with features usually only found in high-end shorts. Blending nylon and spandex, SELECT Transfer fabric combines excellent stretch with cool comfort, using quick-drying yarns. Anatomic 8-panel design eliminates the inseam and potential pressure points. Pressure Relief Technology gender-specific chamois reduces pressure points via differentiated levels of padding; chamois also wicks moisture off skin. The levels of padding (total of 13mm) in the 3D Race women-specific chamois are contoured in varying densities to preclude friction points and protect key areas. Breathable 4-way stretch chamois features highly elastic open- and closed-cell padding that moves with the body for comfort. Fusion technology bonds the dual-density padding to eliminate seams and thereby increase comfort. Pearl Izumi women's Attack bike shorts feature a wide waistband that provides comfort and a solid but nonbinding fit. Silicone grippers at leg hems hold shorts in position. Fabric provides UPF 50+ sun protection, shielding skin from harmful ultraviolet rays.","short_description":"A perennial favorite of the weekend warrior, the women's Pearl Izumi Attack bike shorts provide function and durability with features usually only found in high-end shorts.","category":"Cycling","subcategory":"Cycling Clothing","product_group":"Bike Shorts","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s390639.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l390639.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=390639&tt=df","retail_price":"80.00","sale_price":"80.00","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=390639\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m390639.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=828581&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8285810001":{"sku":"8285810001","vendor_sku":"11211208027S","upc":"703051739034","size":"S","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"80.00","sale_price":"80.00"},"8285810002":{"sku":"8285810002","vendor_sku":"11211208027M","upc":"703051739027","size":"M","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"80.00","sale_price":"80.00"},"8285810003":{"sku":"8285810003","vendor_sku":"11211208027L","upc":"703051739010","size":"L","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"80.00","sale_price":"80.00"},"8285810004":{"sku":"8285810004","vendor_sku":"11211208027XL","upc":"703051739041","size":"XL","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"80.00","sale_price":"80.00"},"8285810005":{"sku":"8285810005","vendor_sku":"11211208027XXL","upc":"703051739065","size":"XXL","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"80.00","sale_price":"80.00"},"8285810006":{"sku":"8285810006","vendor_sku":"112112084DOS","upc":"703051071264","size":"S","color":"BLACK TEXTURE","retail_price":"80.00","sale_price":"80.00"},"8285810007":{"sku":"8285810007","upc":"703051071257","size":"M","color":"BLACK TEXTURE","retail_price":"80.00","sale_price":"80.00"},"8285810008":{"sku":"8285810008","upc":"703051071240","size":"L","color":"BLACK TEXTURE","retail_price":"80.00","sale_price":"80.00"}},"categories":["cycling","cycling-clothing","bike-shorts"]}
