{"sku":"861340","manufacturer_id":"14357","brand_name":"Rei","product_name":"REI Endeavor Pants - Women's Plus Sizes","long_description":"REI Endeavor Pants in plus sizes have just about every detail you'd want in all-weather hiking clothing, including quick-drying fabric that stretches so you can move comfortably. Durable double-weave polyester/spandex fabric provides 4-way stretch for excellent range of motion and comfort while climbing and hiking. Fabric is wind resistant up to 30 mph and has a durable water repellent finish. With a UPF 50+ rating, fabric provides excellent protection against harmful ultraviolet rays. Polyester tricot lines the waistband to wick sweat and enhance comfort. Fit adjustment is quick and easy, thanks to a cord cleat inside the waistband. Center gusset extends your range of motion; ergonomic seam placement and articulated knees allow comfortable movement. Zippered hems with rip-and-stick tabs allow pants to adjust around boots; ankle scuff guards are bonded rather than sewn for enhanced durability. Zip hand pockets, a welded zip leg pocket and 2 rear pockets provide plenty of storage options. REI Endeavor Pants in plus sizes have a classic fit that's cut just right for easy wearing.","short_description":"REI Endeavor Pants in plus sizes have just about every detail you'd want in all-weather hiking clothing, including quick-drying fabric that stretches so you can move comfortably.","category":"Women's Clothing","subcategory":"Women's Pants","product_group":"Women's Hiking Pants","thumb_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/s394931.png","image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/l394931.png","buy_link":"http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?p=81603&pw=55475&pt=3&pri=394931&tt=df","retail_price":"79.50","sale_price":"79.50","product_page_view_tracking":"<img src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/dfpv.php?p=81603&amp;pri=394931\" width=\"0\" height=\"0\" style=\"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" alt=\"\" />","medium_image_url":"http://i1.avlws.com/115/m394931.png","product_content_widget":"<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"http://www.avantlink.com/apcw.php?mode=5&amp;pw=55475&amp;df=115&amp;sku=861340&amp;link=&amp;tabs=-Details\"></script>","variants":{"8613400002":{"sku":"8613400002","vendor_sku":"14357","upc":"486134000022","size":"18W","color":"QUIET SHADE","retail_price":"79.50","sale_price":"79.50"},"8613400003":{"sku":"8613400003","vendor_sku":"14357","upc":"486134000039","size":"20W","color":"QUIET SHADE","retail_price":"79.50","sale_price":"79.50"},"8613400007":{"sku":"8613400007","vendor_sku":"14357","upc":"486134000077","size":"18W","color":"STEEL GREY","retail_price":"79.50","sale_price":"79.50"},"8613400008":{"sku":"8613400008","vendor_sku":"14357","upc":"486134000084","size":"20W","color":"STEEL GREY","retail_price":"79.50","sale_price":"79.50"},"8613400009":{"sku":"8613400009","vendor_sku":"14357","upc":"486134000091","size":"22W","color":"STEEL GREY","retail_price":"79.50","sale_price":"79.50"},"8613400011":{"sku":"8613400011","vendor_sku":"14357","upc":"486134000114","size":"16W","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"79.50","sale_price":"79.50"},"8613400012":{"sku":"8613400012","vendor_sku":"14357","upc":"486134000121","size":"18W","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"79.50","sale_price":"79.50"},"8613400013":{"sku":"8613400013","vendor_sku":"14357","upc":"486134000138","size":"20W","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"79.50","sale_price":"79.50"},"8613400014":{"sku":"8613400014","vendor_sku":"14357","upc":"486134000145","size":"22W","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"79.50","sale_price":"79.50"},"8613400015":{"sku":"8613400015","vendor_sku":"14357","upc":"486134000152","size":"24W","color":"BLACK","retail_price":"79.50","sale_price":"79.50"}}}
