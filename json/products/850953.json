{"sku":"850953","manufacturer_id":"18602","brand_name":"Nrs","product_name":" NRS Czar 6 Inflatable Stand Up Paddleboard - 9' 6\"","long_description":"Where will you use the wave-hunting NRS Czar inflatable stand up paddleboard next? It packs down to a travel-friendly size so you can explore legendary breaks and unspoiled beaches. Large paddlers who have a hard time finding an inflatable they like will love the NRS Czar; it has a weight capacity of 275 lbs. 9.5 ft. length and 34 in. width makes for a maneuverable, stable platform that's designed to catch waves. When you're not chasing the surf, the sleek profile of the Czar offers efficient glide on flatwater. Spanning the interior of the inflatable, thousands of drop-stitch fibers allow a very high, almost rock-hard, inflation pressure. PVC-coated polyester stands up to heavy use, and a specialized drop stitching and coating process creates a board that can be inflated to 15 psi. High air pressure creates a rigid hull without the use of frame parts. Not only does the NRS Czar handle like a composite board, but it deflates and folds up for travel and convenient storage. Textured and grooved deck padding grips your feet and enhances maneuverability. Removable center fin and 2 side fins promote easy tracking. Recessed center webbing strap offers easy transport, and bow and stern webbing handles offer a handy place to grab when remounting board from the water. Bow and stern D-rings offer a great place to clip accessories or a board leash (not included). The NRS Czar inflatable stand up paddleboard includes carrying case with shoulder straps, high-pressure pump, pressure gauge and repair kit. Uses Leafield C7 valves. Packed dimensions 35 x 17 x 17 in.","short_description":"Where will you use the wave-hunting NRS Czar inflatable stand up paddleboard next?
