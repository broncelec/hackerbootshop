description_list: <h4>The 3-season NEMO Veda 1P Tent gives solo backpackers a magical
  combination of light weight, packability and livability you will love while living
  on the trail</h4><ul class="description"><li> Ultralight design relies on 1 pair
  of trekking poles (sold separately) instead of tent poles to minimize weight and
  create a spacious interior with ample sitting height</li><li> Oversize grommets
  locate the tips of crossed trekking poles; reinforced areas at the top of the tent
  receive pole handles</li><li> Large vestibule offers generous protected space for
  gear; it rolls back with a shed-style overhang for weather protection and refreshing
  airflow</li><li> Wicking fabric overhead effectively manages condensation; built-in
  light pocket makes it easy to illuminate the interior with a headlamp or other light</li><li>
  The NEMO Veda 1P Tent comes with a drybag-style stuff sack, stakes, guy-out cord
  and repair kit</li></ul>
