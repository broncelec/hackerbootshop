description_list: '<h4>The REI Lightweight Polartec(R) Power Dry(R) Zip-T shirt in
  men''s tall sizes can be worn as the first of several layers in colder temperatures
  or alone when you need less warmth</h4><ul class="description"><li> Polartec Power
  Dry uses 2 different yarns on either side of the fabric to enhance comfort: interior
  yarn wicks moisture, and exterior yarn dries quickly</li><li> The combination of
  the 2 yarns helps keep you dry during highly aerobic activities because it moves
  moisture away from skin faster than single-component fabrics such as cotton</li><li>
  Updated fabric protects skin against harmful ultraviolet light with a UPF rating
  of 20, and is very soft to the touch</li><li> Deep center front zipper allows ventilation
  control; features an inner draft flap and locking zipper head</li><li> Flatseam
  construction is soft and non-chafing next to skin; raglan sleeves keep the seams
  off the shoulders to minimize irritation when wearing a pack</li><li> Underarm and
  side gussets promote freedom of motion</li><li> Dropped back hem stays tucked in</li><li>
  The REI Lightweight Polartec Power Dry Zip-T shirt for tall men features a next-to-skin
  fit that hugs the body and boosts fabric performance</li></ul>'
