description_list: <h4>The Jetboil Zip(TM) stove delivers the same great performance
  and reliability of the original Jetboil at an even better price</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  It's more compact and lighter weight, too! Jetboil Zip includes a 0</li><li>8-liter
  aluminum FluxRing(R) cooking cup with insulating cozy to keep your drinks and meals
  warm</li><li> Same as the original Jetboil, the stove burner and cooking cup twist
  together to create a single convenient cooking system; disconnect the burner and
  cooking cup for storage</li><li> FluxRing(R) heat exchanger on the bottom of the
  cooking cup creates excellent fuel efficiency; the Zip boils 0</li><li>5 liter of
  water in 2 min</li><li> 31 sec</li><li> Adjustable-flame burner is housed in a windscreen,
  reducing heat loss when a breeze picks up</li><li> Drink-through lid features a
  pour spout and a built-in strainer</li><li> Stove burner and 100g fuel canister
  (sold separately) stow inside the cup; lid snaps shut for storage</li><li> Bottom
  cover unsnaps from the cooking cup to double as a measuring cup or bowl; measuring
  cup comes in handy when preparing meals and hot drinks</li><li> Includes a stabilizer
  tripod that clips onto fuel canister (sold separately)</li><li> Sewn-on tunnel pocket
  on the cozy holds your utensils or Jetboil hanging kit (sold separately)</li><li>
  Jetboil Zip stove is compatible with all Jetboil accessories (sold separately)</li><li>
  Due to flammable item shipping restrictions, we cannot sell fuel canisters online;
  they are available at REI retail stores</li><li> Because this stove system has a
  capacity of less than 1 liter, the average boil time specification represents the
  time required to do 2 separate boils of 0</li><li>5 liter of water</li></ul>
