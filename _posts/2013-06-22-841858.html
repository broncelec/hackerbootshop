description_list: <h4>Have a blast carving up the slopes with the women's Nordica
  Transfire RSW ski boots-available only at REI! The Nordica Transfire RSW boots use
  a new shell design to enhance side-to-side control, offering precise lateral pressure
  to put modern skis on edge</h4><ul class="description"><li> Boots flex lightly at
  first, then as you put greater pressure on tongues during turn, the resistance increases
  and enhances precision</li><li> After flexing, boots return to upright position
  very quickly, setting you up for the next turn</li><li> In addition to flexing progressively,
  the Transfire RSW boots feature a block in the spine of the boot that ensures the
  boots do not engage the skis too quickly</li><li> Getting your foot in the boot
  is hassle free thanks to a forgiving 3-piece shell design</li><li> As compared to
  men's liners, women-specific liners feature extra padding in the tongue, more insulation
  throughout and a contoured top edge designed to fit women's calves</li><li> Shaped
  footbeds with contoured arches and heel cups optimize foot position and provide
  responsive performance, and this shaping carries over to the liner to increase support</li><li>
  Liners provide a personalized fit around heel, ankle and center of foot when custom
  molded</li><li> Middle buckles clamp down on feet at a 45deg angle to keep heels
  securely seated and increase comfort in forefeet</li><li> Power strap acts as a
  fourth buckle, allowing you to set the firmness around the upper ankle to favor
  comfort or performance</li><li> Double canting adjusts the cuffs to fit the angles
  of your lower legs and offers a versatile range of adjustment</li><li> 90 flex index
  provides the power transfer suited to intermediate skiers</li><li> 102mm-wide forefoot
  offers a great mix of comfort and precision</li></ul>
