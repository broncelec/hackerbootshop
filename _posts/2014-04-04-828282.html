description_list: <h4>The weather can change quickly when you're in the mountains</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> With the Kuhl Liberator convertible pants you can adapt
  to changing conditions and stay comfortable</li><li> Recognizing this 2012 Editors'
  Choice Award winner, the April issue of BACKPACKER says, "The Liberator has a trim,
  mountain-town style that slyly masks the two-in-one design</li><li>"</li><li> Pants
  convert quickly and easily to shorts with leg zippers; zippers won't snag and are
  hidden from view for a great look</li><li> Fabric blend places cotton on the outside
  and nylon next to skin; soft cotton pulls moisture away from the nylon, bringing
  it to the surface where it can evaporate</li><li> Liberator pants feature Kuhl Rhino
  Technology, which places rugged exterior fabrics on top of soft, stretchy fabric
  for excellent durability and freedom of movement</li><li> Rhino Technology is used
  in high-mobility areas, such as the back waistband and the knees</li><li> Standard
  5-pocket design combines with 2 zippered thigh pockets, a welt pocket on the left
  side and a 3D cell phone pocket on the right side to stow all your essentials</li><li>
  The Kuhl Liberator convertible pants have a gusseted crotch and articulated knees
  that facilitate freedom of movement for increased comfort</li></ul>
