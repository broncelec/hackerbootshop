description_list: <h4>The Salomon Q-105 skis blend the high stability of 105mm waists
  with the deep-snow flotation of rockered tips and tails to create a pair of skis
  to slay powder and explore all off-piste terrain</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Rockered profile excels in soft snow and delivers fluid performance on hardpack;
  when put on edge, 95% of edge length contacts the snow for precision on groomed
  runs</li><li> Designed for demanding skiers who require high performance, full wood
  core delivers direct transmission of power with precision and efficiency</li><li>
  Perfect for pulling off freeski maneuvers, a single-layer cap design provides precise
  edge grip and efficient energy transfer from skier to snow</li><li> Elastomer inserts
  placed over the edges absorb vibrations, resulting in a smooth ride that softens
  ski-to-snow contact</li><li> Tips feature a honeycomb structure that reduces weight
  to make the skis more maneuverable and playful</li><li> Tips are designed to slice
  through deep snow without hooking and decrease deflection at high speeds</li><li>
  Fiber reinforcements laid directly on the edges add torsional rigidity and improve
  edge durability, and wide metal edges withstand big impacts and improve shock resistance</li><li>
  The Salomon Q-105 skis require bindings with wide brakes</li><li> Base or topsheet
  color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
