description_list: <h4>The Lange RSJ 65 Jr ski boots let young skiers bring precise
  speed to their next descent</h4><ul class="description"><li> Because the Lange RSJ
  65 Jr ski boots are made of a single, uniform material (versus bi-injected shells),
  power transfer is highly efficient</li><li> Single-material shells are also much
  easier for boot fitters to grind and punch</li><li> Shells are designed to create
  a centered, balanced stance using a low heel lift and an upright forward lean</li><li>
  Upright stance makes it easy to stay balanced on today's shaped and rockered skis,
  reducing fatigue and increasing efficiency of skiing technique</li><li> Based on
  adult liners used in racing boots, the RSJ 65 Jr liners feature shaped padding and
  a neoprene toe box that provide warmth and comfort</li><li> Low cuffs are designed
  to maximize the natural range of motion for young skiers</li><li> Arched soles enhance
  flex and provide a distinct feel that helps young skiers dig into their turns</li><li>
  With a 60 flex index, Lange RSJ 65 Jr ski boots provide flex appropriate for young
  skiers</li></ul>
