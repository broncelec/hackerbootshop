description_list: <h4>Featuring the same feel as the original Icelantic Nomad skis
  but shrunk down to an 85mm waist for control in icy and hardpack snow, the Icelantic
  Nomad RKR SKNY skis are adaptable to any terrain</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Multiple layers of fiberglass are layered around a poplar wood core to provide high
  responsiveness</li><li> Early rise in the tips and tails combines with camber underfoot
