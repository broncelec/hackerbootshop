<h3>The North Face Blaze Insulated jacket helps keep girls warm without the weight or bulk of a heavy coat</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Ripstop nylon with synthetic insulation provides protection from the cold</li>
<li> Ripstop nylon exterior has a Durable Water Repellant finish for water resistance that keeps her dry as she dashes home from the bus stop in a sudden rain</li>
<li> Lightweight synthetic insulation traps body heat without being bulky</li>
<li> FlashDry(TM) fabric technology speeds the removal of moisture from the skin for evaporation so she stays dry and comfortable in a wide range of conditions</li>
<li> 2 zippered hand pockets keep her hands warm and stow small valuables</li>
<li> ID tag lets you mark the jacket with her name so it never gets lost in the crowd</li>
<li> Jacket easily compresses for storing inside the left pocket</li>
<li> Bottom hem of the Blaze Insulated jacket can be cinched for a snug fit that keeps her warmer when the windchill picks up</li>
<li> Closeout</li>
</ul>
