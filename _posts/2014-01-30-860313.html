description_list: <h4>With a subtle, fully rockered profile, the advanced-level Volkl
  Bridge skis are ready to shred big mountain lines and spend the rest of the day
  hucking in the half pipe</h4><ul class="description"><li> When tipped over and put
  on edge, the smooth, gradual rocker from tip to tail creates uninterrupted edge
  contact during the turn, ripping graceful arcs into groomed terrain</li><li> Full
  rocker also increases maneuverability in soft snow, so you can play on the backside
  of the mountain or hunt down overlooked stashes of pow</li><li> The full rocker
  profile of the Bridge skis is subtle compared to that of powder-specific Volkl skis
  and is well suited to the hard snow of the half pipe</li><li> Quick and responsive
  across all terrain and in all conditions, the 95mm waists turn easily on hardpack
  and offer enough flotation to enjoy powder</li><li> With a vertically laminated
  poplar and beech core and vertical sidewalls, Bridge skis turn easily from edge
  to edge and are responsive to aggressive turns at high speed</li><li> Tough Box
  construction sheathes the wood core in composite and fiberglass to remain durable
  during high speed landings and to snap back quickly from butters and ollies</li><li>
  Carbon laminate in the bottom layer of the core stabilizes the ride and further
  enhances durability</li><li> Directional twin tip heavily favors skiing forward
  but allows you to ski and land jumps backward if needed</li><li> Base or topsheet
  color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
