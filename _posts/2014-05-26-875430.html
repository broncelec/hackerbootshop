description_list: <h4>Go out and dominate any trail on the WTB Trail Boss 29er Comp
  Tire, a performance-oriented 29er tire dedicated to cross-country and all-mountain
  rides</h4><ul class="description"><li> Tread is tightly spaced for high speed, drag-free
  onslaughts, yet blocky and tall enough to really dig in when it comes time to slam
  on the brakes</li><li> A rounded profile and staggered, supported side knobs keep
  clamoring for traction even as the trail becomes smooth</li><li> Relatively tight
  tread spacing provides an excellent plane for riding harder surfaces, creating a
  smooth-rolling sensation</li><li> Siping on center blocks as well as corner blocks
  create more working edges, and as tires undergo braking and cornering additional
  bands of grip are exposed to enhance traction</li><li> The cornering side blocks
  are offset from each other to create consistency and a predictable feel when transitioning
  from outer tread to inner tread</li><li> A robust casing provides the strength needed
  for wire bead tires to last, and a high ratio of rubber to thread protects against
  trail threats and urban unpleasantries</li><li> Proprietary 60a durometer rubber
  compound offers the ideal mix of rolling efficiency and traction for cross-country
  and trail riding; plus, it's versatile and long lasting</li></ul>
