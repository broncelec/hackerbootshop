description_list: <h4>Featuring the new NEMO Spoon(TM) Shape, the Nocturne 15 down
  sleeping bag strays from the traditional mummy shape to match the way you actually
  sleep</h4><ul class="description"><li> The new NEMO Spoon Shape is wide in the shoulders,
  tapers to the hips and then gently flares back out to allow room for the natural
  bend and shift of knees</li><li> DownTek(TM) 700-fill-power duck down is treated
  with a micro-thin polymer so it will repel water and maintain loft and insulation
  value, even in the wettest conditions</li><li> A nifty little feature in the hood
  is the tuckable Blanket Fold(TM), an insulated flap of fabric that can be wrapped
  around your neck to block drafts and add warmth</li><li> Vertical baffle construction
  curves to the shape of your body; construction keeps down from shifting around,
  preventing cold spots</li><li> Footbox has a waterproof/breathable coating on the
  backside of the fabric that combines with a Durable Water Repellent finish on the
  exterior to protect from tent condensation</li><li> Includes a pillow pocket to
  hold your pillow (sold separately) and a zippered watch pocket so you'll hear your
  alarm go off in the morning</li><li> NEMO Nocturne 15 down sleeping bag comes with
  a roll-top compression stuff sack and a storage bag</li></ul>
