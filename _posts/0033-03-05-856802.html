<h3>The Elmer Fudd-approved REI Buffalo Plaid cap is lined with soft polyester fleece and features warm insulation to keep your head toasty when you're hunting "wabbits" or going for a cold-weather hike</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Polyester/wool exterior is lined at the crown with soft polyester microfleece and features a touch of polyester insulation to keep your head toasty warm on cold winter days</li>
<li> Soft polyester sherpa fleece lines the earflaps for excellent warmth and comfort next to skin; tie the earflaps up when you don't need them</li>
<li> REI Buffalo Plaid cap has a small inner drop-down earband that can be used in milder temperatures when you don't need the full protection of the earflaps</li>
</ul>
