<h3>The REI Stuff travel duffel offers a versatile storage solution: carry it like a duffle or wear it like a backpack, and when you're finished, simply stuff it in to its own pocket</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Backpack straps hide in their own sleeve when not in use; nylon carry handles offer solid haul points</li>
<li> Nylon fabric is light and durable, and compacts easily for travel use</li>
<li> Includes anchor points for attachment of a single shoulder carry strap (not included)</li>
<li> When not in use the REI Stuff travel duffel folds in to its own zippered pocket; simply turn the pocket inside out and start stuffing</li>
</ul>
