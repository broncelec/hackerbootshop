<h3>The women's petite REI Sport pants keep up with your fast-paced lifestyle thanks to a great fit and performance fabric</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Active fit with 4-way stretch is great for cool-weather outdoor training, trail running and hiking, as well as indoor pursuits</li>
<li> Polyester and spandex fabric wicks moisture and helps protect skin from harmful UV light with a UPF 50+ rating</li>
<li> Breathable elastic waistband offers an extremely comfortable fit</li>
<li> Small drop-in pocket stores accessories on left hip, away from core training or stretching should you need to lay on your back</li>
<li> You'll go farther without discomfort thanks to flat seams which are placed to work with your stride</li>
<li> Front and rear princess seams offer a feminine look</li>
<li> Reflective details of the women's petite REI Sport pants increase visibility in dim light</li>
