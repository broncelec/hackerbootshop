<h3>Stylish and versatile, the Cheakamus Triclimate 3-in-1 insulated jacket by The North Face offers complete weather protection in an adaptive design and streamlined fit for season-long performance</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> 3 different ways to wear the system: wear shell jacket and zip-in liner jacket together for maximum protection or wear either piece on its own as weather warrants</li>
<li> HyVent(TM) 2-layer construction is waterproof, windproof and breathable; fully sealed seams prevent moisture from seeping through</li>
<li> Powder skirt with gripping elastic keeps snow out; snaps let you integrate the powder skirt with compatible pants by The North Face (sold separately)</li>
<li> Chest pocket; zip handwarmer pockets; wrist pocket with goggles cloth; internal goggles pocket</li>
<li> Cinch adjustable hem and rip-and-stick wrist cuffs help seal out cold air and retain valuable warmth; core vents let you control airflow and your comfort</li>
<li> Fully adjustable, removable hood ensures a weather-blocking, personalized fit</li>
<li> The North Face Cheakamus Triclimate zip-in/out liner jacket uses Heatseeker(TM) 100g polyfiber insulation to keep you warm without inhibiting movement</li>
<li> Liner jacket has zippered handwarmer pockets and an internal media pocket for convenience when wearing liner on its own</li>
<li> Easy zip-in system mates the liner jacket and shell jacket together for added warmth and allows easy reach-in access to the shell's interior features</li>
</ul>
