description_list: '<h4>The POC Trabec Race MIPS bike helmet uses strategically placed
  layers of materials and the MIPS system to offer sturdy protection for your noggin</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> Tough outer shell joins with an internal aramid shell bonded
  to a shock-absorbent expanded polystyrene layer, all of which produces a helmet
  of exceptional resiliency</li><li> Helmet design aims to protect more of the head,
  coming down lower on the sides and back to offer more coverage, and, in turn, more
  protection</li><li> MIPS system uses a low-friction layer between the outer shell
  and the head to limit the rotational forces to the brain in the event of an oblique
  impact</li><li> 16 vents on the front, top, sides and rear of helmet channel fresh
  air over your head, helping keep you cool and comfortable</li><li> Helmet comes
  with a removable visor</li><li> It''s easy to achieve a comfortable fit with the
  POC Trabec Race MIPS bike helmet, thanks to the adjustable straps and rear harness</li><li>
  Comfortable foam padding can be changed to personalize fit and can be removed for
  cleaning</li><li> Please note: while the Trabec Race MIPS helmet is designed to
  withstand multiple impacts, it should be inspected after any crash, using your best
  judgement for continued use</li></ul>'
