description_list: <h4>The Blizzard Cochise skis float high in powder and bust through
  windblown crud with their stable 108mm waists and naturally rockered tips and tails
  designed for maneuvering in soft snow</h4><ul class="description"><li> Blizzard
  builds the rocker without bending the core, creating a naturally flexing, responsive
  ski that turns easily, resists high-speed chatter and shreds crud and pow</li><li>
  Light camber underfoot assists with grip on hardpack</li><li> Wood core is constructed
  like a sandwich with layers of precisely-milled strips reinforcing each other to
  create a lightweight, snappy ski with smooth and easy handling</li><li> A dual titanium
  laminate increases stiffness during the turn, adding power that aggressive skiers
  will love</li><li> Sidewalls direct power right to the edges of the skis, resulting
  in quick side-to-side response</li><li> 108mm waists require bindings with wide
  brakes</li></ul>
