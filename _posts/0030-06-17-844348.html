<h3>The REI Revelcloud men's jacket stuffs easily into your backpack and provides lightweight warmth during cold, dry days on the trail, or layer it under a shell on rainy days for ultimate protection</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Water- and wind-resistant Revelcloud offers breathability and warmth without weighing you down</li>
<li> Pertex(TM) Quantum recycled fabric and a soft lining create an incredibly lightweight, durable and packable jacket; contrast-color lining looks sharp</li>
<li> PrimaLoft(R) Eco synthetic microfiber insulation works a lot like down with low bulk and excellent packability, yet provides warmth even when wet</li>
<li> Revelcloud blocks winds up to 50 mph and the Durable Water Repellent finish fends off light rain showers, snow and stains</li>
<li> Full-length front zipper features an internal draft flap; chin guard protects skin from zipper abrasion</li>
<li> Raglan sleeves eliminate shoulder seams, enhancing range of motion and comfort under pack straps</li>
<li> Internal hem drawcord seals in warmth; cuffs are trimmed with stretch binding</li>
<li> 2 zip handwarmer pockets and zip chest pocket with media port</li>
<li> REI Revelcloud jacket packs into its own interior lumbar pocket; use it for an emergency pillow</li>
