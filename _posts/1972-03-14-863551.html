<h3>The North Face Eat My Dust Sport tank top enhances comfort as you push through your training routine thanks to its moisture-wicking performance fabric and expertly constructed high-impact bra</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> VaporWick(R) polyester fabric keeps up with hard-working pores, moving sweat from your skin to the fabric's outer face for quick evaporation</li>
<li> Mesh panels aligned in high-perspiration areas vent excess heat</li>
<li> Expertly constructed, high-impact internal bra features mesh racer-back straps, a brushed elastic band and two layers of fabric for modesty</li>
<li> 2 discreet pockets in the straps of the tank top store small items such as a house key or lip balm; moisture barrier in pocket protects contents</li>
<li> The North Face Eat My Dust Sport tank top features a reflective logo that helps increase your visibility in low light</li>
<li> Closeout</li>
</ul>
