description_list: <h4>The Thomson Elite X4 31</h4><ul class="description"><li>8mm
  stem is designed to have the best combination of stiffness, light weight, strength,
  and durability</li><li> Machined from 7000-series aluminum; the stem is a 1-piece
  design with no welds or joints</li><li> New steerer clamps save about 20g of weight</li><li>
  Wide clamp length (48mm) and patent pending undercut around the handlebar combine
  to grip the handlebar more securely; provides a stiff ride with minimal flexing
  or squeaking</li><li> Steerer tube clamps have a large surface area and go around
  the steerer tube more that 180deg 2 bolts provide and extra level of security</li><li>
  Center tubular section is tapered with a constant wall thickness, resulting in a
  high stiffness-to-weight ratio and torsional rigidty</li><li> Annodized to maintain
  a nice appearance and prevent corrosion</li><li> Thomson logo is applied with a
  laser, so it will not rub off; laser marking process is specially designed to maintain
  the integrity of the anodization</li><li> Stack height is 40mm and rise is 0deg</li><li>
  X4 is engineered to work very well with both carbon handlebars and carbon steerer
  tubes</li><li> Every component of the stem, including the fasteners, is 100% American
  made</li></ul>
