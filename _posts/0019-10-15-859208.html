<h3>Whether you're hiking in cold weather, skiing, snowshoeing or mountaineering, the REI Heavyweight Polartec(R) Power Dry(R) Zip-T gives you a warm and moisture-wicking base layer</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Polartec Power Dry uses two different yarns on either side of the fabric to enhance comfort; interior yarn wicks moisture and exterior yarn dries quickly</li>
<li> Combination of the two yarns helps keep you dry during highly aerobic activities, moving moisture away from your skin and drying more quickly than single-component fabrics</li>
<li> Center front zipper allows ventilation control; underarm and side gussets promote freedom of motion</li>
<li> Flatseam construction is soft and non-chafing next to skin; offset shoulder seams prevent chafing under backpack straps</li>
<li> Longer length helps the REI Heavyweight Polartec Power Dry Zip-T stay tucked in; smooth texture of outer surface makes it easy to slide on outer layers</li>
<li> Fabric offers a UPF rating of 50+ to help protect against harmful UV light</li>
<li> REI Heavyweight Polartec Power Dry Zip-T features a next-to-skin fit that hugs the body</li>
<li> Closeout</li>
</ul>
