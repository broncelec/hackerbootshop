description_list: <h4>A great storage place to keep items accessible and out of the
  bilge water, this bag attaches under your canoe seat with two side release buckles</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> Unlike thwart bags, the Original Stowaway Seat Pack can
  be left in your canoe during portages</li><li> Rigid plastic bottom keeps the bag
  from sagging when it is heavily loaded</li><li> Updated design is now built with
  Cordura(R) nylon--it's every bit as strong as former material but much lighter</li><li>
  Fits bench style seats best but will also work with most tractor style seats</li></ul>
