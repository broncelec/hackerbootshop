description_list: <h4>Built large for epic days of deep powder, the Volkl Two skis
  feature huge 124mm waists, full rocker and a tapered sidecut at tips and tails for
  excellent manueverability atop deep snow</h4><ul class="description"><li> Full rocker
  increases maneuverability in deep snow, making turns in powder effortless and giving
  the skis a surflike, floaty feel</li><li> The smooth, gradual rocker from tip to
  tail also creates uninterrupted edge contact on groomed runs so you can maneuver
  these jumbo powder skis back to the lifts</li><li> Early taper in the tip and tail
  allows the ski to drift easily from turn to turn instead of the automatic turn initiation
  and hooking that happens with a standard sidecut</li><li> Low tip reduces chatter
  on groomed runs and resists diving in soft snow</li><li> Multilayer wooden core
  uses dense ash under the bindings to ensure screws won't come loose during harsh
  landings; soft poplar elsewhere makes the skis snappy and responsive</li><li> Tough
  Box construction sheathes the wood core in composite and fiberglass to remain durable
  during high speed landings and to snap back quickly from aggressive turns</li><li>
  Carbon laminate in the bottom layer of the core stabilizes the ride and further
  enhances durability</li><li> Stiff flex zone in front adds stability, and medium
  flex underfoot transitions to the soft tail that aids in turning on groomers and
  maneuvering in pow</li><li> Directional twin tip heavily favors skiing forward but
  allows you to ski and land jumps backward if needed</li><li> Volkl Two skis feature
  124mm waists that require bindings with wide brakes</li><li> Base or topsheet color
  may vary from online photo</li></ul>
