<h3>The REI Quarter Dome T1 semi-freestanding tent uses lightweight materials and a unique pole design to create a 1-person, 3-season backpacking tent that's roomy, well ventilated and strong</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> One side-entry door and a large Dry Entry vestibule offer convenient access and ample storage capacity</li>
<li> REI-exclusive Tension Truss design enhances structural stability, prevents deformation in the wind and maximizes room around your head and shoulders</li>
<li> Semi-freestanding tripod design requires less material to keep overall weight low; staking the tent out maximizes interior space</li>
<li> Aluminum DAC Featherlight NSL hubbed poles are lightweight; set-up is quick and easy with pole clips and color coding</li>
<li> Fully adjustable, high-level vents mitigate condensation, drawing cool air under the fly from the lower perimeter and exhausting warm, moist air</li>
<li> Bathtub floor with seam-sealed corners ensures waterproof protection</li>
<li> Windproof, breathable perimeter fabric blocks dust and sand from blowing in under the fly</li>
<li> Silicone-treated, lightweight ripstop nylon fly stays taut in the rain, avoiding moisture-transfer to the tent while keeping you dry</li>
<li> No-Wick welded construction ensures that moisture won't wick through susceptible areas such as guyout points, pole wraps or zippers in wet conditions</li>
<li> REI Quarterdome 1 tent offers multiple interior mesh side pockets and hang loops for organization</li>
<li> Tent door stuffs in its own stash pocket for out-of-the-way convenience</li>
<li> Includes tapered, easy-to-stuff compression stuff sack, 5 stakes, 2 guylines and tighteners, pole repair tube, pole and stake bags</li>
</ul>
