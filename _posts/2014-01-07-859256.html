description_list: <h4>Go from the resort straight to the backcountry with the Salomon
  Guardian WTR 13L randonee bindings</h4><ul class="description"><li> They have the
  feel of alpine bindings, with the benefit of being able to tour in the backcountry</li><li>
  Switching from hike to ski mode shouldn't be a hassle, and it isn't with the Guardian
  bindings-simply flick the switches with your ski poles to change modes</li><li>
  Aggressive skiers who like to cruise at high speeds will appreciate the adjustable
  DIN that ranges from 5 to 13</li><li> Bindings have a low overall stand height of
  26mm for great stability while skiing</li><li> 80mm width transmits power from your
  boots to your wide skis for great downhill performance</li><li> Bindings include
  brakes that come off with a single turn of a screw driver if you need to remove
  them; choose between 100 or 115mm-wide brakes depending on your ski width</li><li>
  Choose the size that's just wider than the underfoot width of your skis; for example,
  choose 115mm size for 110mm-waisted skis</li><li> Toe-piece height can be adjusted
  to fit your boots</li><li> Flip the climbing bars up with your ski poles to take
  some stress off your legs when you're skinning uphill</li><li> Salomon Guardian
  WTR 13L randonee bindings fit boot sizes Mondo 26</li><li>5 and larger; bindings
  are only compatible with boots with alpine DIN soles or WTR soles</li></ul>
