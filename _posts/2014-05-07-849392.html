description_list: '<h4>Built for pure performance, the Mavic Ksyrium SLR wheelset
  is all about speed-featherweight, stiff and responsive speed-and comes outfitted
  with tires for race readiness out of the box</h4><ul class="description"><li> 22mm
  deep front and 25mm deep rear rims are strengthened where the spokes exert the greatest
  stress; rear rim utilizes an asymmetric shape to enhance stiffness and durability</li><li>
  Lightweight yet strong proprietary aluminum rims have a drilling method that doesn''t
  penetrate the tube-facing wall, strengthening rim and eliminating the need for rim
  strips</li><li> Both rims feature a milled braking surface to improve friction;
  rim joints are welded and milled to eliminate shuddering during braking and provide
  superior wheel balance</li><li> Inter Spoke Milling reduces material between spokes,
  lowering weight and the amount of effort needed to spin the wheels up for superb
  climbing and acceleration</li><li> Rear hub features a lightweight and stiff aluminum
  hub body with pawls that are backed by stainless-steel inserts for reliable, strong
  engagement and power transfer</li><li> Both hubs boast a microadjustable system
  that lets you dial in bearing performance; double-sealed cartridge bearings deliver
  excellent longevity and smooth spinning</li><li> Front wheel features radially laced,
  straight-pull bladed spokes made of a very lightweight, stiff alloy for minimal
  weight and exacting performance</li><li> Rear wheel boasts a blend of round carbon
  spokes (non-drive-side, radial lacing) and bladed alloy spokes (drive side, 2 cross)
  to maximize stiffness and minimize weight</li><li> Yksion Pro 700x23c clincher tires
  are included, offering front- and rear-specific performance for maximizing grip
  up front and minimizing rolling resistance in the back</li><li> Both tires have
  supple 127 tpi casings and are backed with a superior, puncture-resistant Kevlar(R)
  breaker; maximum recommended pressure of 130 psi (9 bar)</li><li> Please note: tubes
  use Presta valves</li></ul>'
