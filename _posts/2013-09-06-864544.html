  around on your spring, summer and fall adventures</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  With a European Norm (EN) lower-limit rating of 20degF, the Furnace 20 is a versatile

  550-fill-power ProDown(TM) natural goose down insulation is light and lofty</li><li>

  it to dry faster and repel moisture up to 10x longer than untreated down</li><li>

  into high-pressure areas that contact the ground to create an insulating buffer</li><li>
  Shaped hood and down-insulated draft collar hold in warmth</li><li> Insulated draft
  tube backs the zipper to prevent warm air from escaping; antisnag tape keeps the
  zipper from catching on the draft tube</li><li> 3/4-length, 2-way zipper lets you
  make adjustments for ventilation</li><li> Comfort-oriented shape has a less-tapered
  cut than some backpacking sleeping bags, allowing you more room to move around</li><li>
