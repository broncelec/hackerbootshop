description_list: <h4>The ultralight REI Flash Sleeping Bag uses a clever hybrid of
  water-repellent insulations and waterproof/breathable fabric panels in its double-protection
  design</h4><ul class="description"><li> With a European Norm (EN) lower-limit rating
  of 29degF, this bag is suitable for 3-season use</li><li> REI double-protection
  design combines water-repellent fills with waterproof/breathable fabric at the hood,
  sides and footbox, the areas most likely to touch a damp tent wall</li><li> On top
  of the bag, where superior loft and warmth are key, the bag is filled with water-repellent
  700-fill-power duck down</li><li> On the bottom is resilient Primaloft(R) Sport
  insulation, which performs well in a compressed under-bag space</li><li> Ripstop
  nylon shell also features a durable water repellent finish to further protect the
  bag's insulations</li><li> Performance fit keeps weight low and thermal efficiency
  high</li><li> REI in-the-round design puts vertical baffles in side walls to wrap
  you in warmth and create a better fit than bags that use only horizontal baffles</li><li>
  Contoured hood, insulated face muffler and full-length draft tube all work to keep
  warmth in</li><li> Differentiated hood and neck drawcords simplify adjustments;
  antisnag zipper works smoothly</li><li> Any REI backpacking bag can be zipped to
  any other REI backpacking bag; women's bags zip on the right, unisex on the left</li><li>
  The REI Flash Sleeping Bag includes a nylon stuff sack and a large cotton storage
  bag</li><li> European Norm (EN) is an independent third-party temperature rating,
  allowing accurate comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags</li></ul>
