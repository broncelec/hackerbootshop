description_list: <h4>The Black Diamond Factor 110 randonee boots sport a moderate
  flex to give freeride skiers a comfortable ride, both inbounds and out</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Torsionally stiff Triax Pro Pebax(R) frames provide maximum lateral power transfer
  to drive fat skis and progressive alpinelike flex for downhills</li><li> Pebax plastic
  maintains a consistent flex in all temperatures so your boots won't feel stiff on
  a frigid day</li><li> Medium-stiff, custom-moldable liners allow for a long-lasting,
  accurate fit and use Black Diamond's proprietary foam to maintain longevity and
  warmth</li><li> Boa Freeride Series lacing system provides a precise and personalized
  fit that is simple to adjust with the turn of a dial; Boa holds laces tight and
  secure</li><li> Liners have articulating zones, insulated bases and a 102mm last
  width for comfort and performance</li><li> Ski/walk switch is hassle free with a
  simple on/off toggle; ski mode locks you into a forward lean position that can be
  set at 14deg, 18deg or 22deg</li><li> Boots are built with an overlapping cuff design,
  which produces a natural progressive flex and ankle articulation to drive and steer
  skis as well as absorb terrain</li><li> Four micro-adjustable buckles and a power
  strap on each boot close the Black Diamond Factor 110 randonee boots comfortably
  and securely around the feet and legs</li><li> Boots are equipped with Black Diamond
  Alpine Sole Blocks, making them compatible with all alpine bindings</li><li> Black
  Diamond Alpine Touring Sole Blocks are sold separately and make the boots compatible
  with all randonee bindings, including tech-style bindings such as Dynafit</li><li>
