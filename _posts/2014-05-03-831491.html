  class="description"><li>5 kayak with skeg effectively bridges the gap between a
  fun, maneuverable day-tripping kayak and a predictable touring model</li><li> Rigid

  Touring-style hull offers excellent versatility; great for those seeking a boat
  for everything from ocean swells to local lakes</li><li> Peaked deck and upswept
  bow sheds water quickly and enhances speed, and progressive rocker enhances handling</li><li>

  support if needed</li><li> Backrest may be raised by pulling strap in front of seat
  forward or by pushing the button on front of seat to lower</li><li> Leg lifters
  raise seat pan to increase support and take pressure of the ankles</li><li> Padded
  foam thighbraces may be repositioned to personalize cockpit for performance or comfort</li><li>
  Slidelock footbraces are easy to adjust from inside the boat; simply raise the black
  plastic rod to unlock and slide footbrace into desired position</li><li> Fully bulkheaded

  skeg enhances tracking in rough water and windy conditions; sliding skeg controls

  you stash items you'll want readily available such as a bilge pump, extra paddle
  and map with weatherproof case, not included</li><li> Soft-to-the-touch carry handles
