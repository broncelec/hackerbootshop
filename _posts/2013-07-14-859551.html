description_list: <h4>When the powder is deep, the women's Line Pandora skis open
  up a whole new world of backcountry fun with maneuverable rockered tips and tails
  and 110mm waists that offer high flotation</h4><ul class="description"><li> Tip
  and tail rocker floats high in backcountry powder whether skiing forward or switch;
  relatively low rise planes through powder instead of plowing up and over</li><li>
  Jumbo 110mm waists offer massive surface area for excellent flotation</li><li> Aspen
  wood core consists of a blend of high-quality wood laminates that reduce weight
  and enhance overall strength</li><li> Symmetrical flex pattern in the tips and tails
  allows responsive riding forward or backward</li><li> Widest points of the tip and
  tail are close to the center of the ski, reducing tail drag and hooking in powder</li><li>
  Thin cores and sidewalls in the tips reduce weight and make skis easier to control</li><li>
  P-tex plastic sidewalls isolate vibrations, offering a smooth feel when charging
  at high speed</li><li> The women's Line Pandora skis feature 110mm waists that require
  bindings with wide brakes</li><li> Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
