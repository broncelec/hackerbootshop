description_list: '<h4>Light, strong and comfortable, the THOMSON Carbon Road handlebar
  continues the THOMSON tradition of top-notch construction and performance, all with
  a mild wing shape to offer ergonomic comfort</h4><ul class="description"><li> Mildly
  flattened wing shape along top of the handlebar provides a comfortable platform
  for your hands when climbing or otherwise resting palms atop handlebar</li><li>
  Wing section is sized and shaped so that hand movement and rotation aren''t negatively
  affected or "locked out", even when rotating bar positioning</li><li> Underside
  of wing section is shaped so that cable housing can be taped securely and unobtrusively
  without compromising handlebar strength and longevity</li><li> Shaping on the bottom
  side of the wing allows housing to be taped out of the way without the use of narrow
  housing channels or internal routing, both of which shorten bar life</li><li> Center
  clamping area, which fits 31</li><li>8mm stems, is also wide enough for easy installment
  of clip-on aero bars</li><li> Carbon construction uses 3 different fiber types to
  optimize stiffness and flex for performance and comfort</li><li> Reach on the THOMSON
  Carbon Road handlebar is 78</li><li>5mm for all handlebar sizes; drop is relative
  to size: 40cm = 137mm; 42cm = 140mm; 44cm = 140mm; 46cm = 143mm</li></ul>'
