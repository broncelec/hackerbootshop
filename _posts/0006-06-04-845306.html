<h3>The REI InCamp 4 is a "just-right" camping tent that offers friends and families a weatherproof refuge</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Pair it with the InCamp Shelter for an extended living space where the whole gang can hang out</li>
<li> REI InCamp 4 tent is built for weatherproof integration with the REI InCamp Shelter (sold separately) to extend your living space</li>
<li> Freestanding, compact footprint features a tall entry for easy, wide-open access</li>
<li> Pole clips and sleeves provide a quick and stable setup; all-aluminum, pre-bent frame is strong and durable</li>
<li> Rectangular floor plan makes it easy to arrange sleeping bags and gear, and allows efficient use of space</li>
<li> Huge single door with roof stuff pocket opens fully or to either side for easy access and ventilation</li>
<li> Compact vestibule provides dry-entry awning for weather protection</li>
<li> Perimeter of windproof, breathable fabric keeps dust and sand from blowing in from under the fly</li>
<li> Fully adjustable from inside tent, the high-level vent reduces condensation, drawing cool air under the fly from the lower perimeter and exhausting the warm, moist air</li>
<li> Fly is seam-sealed, 75-denier polyester for high strength and low stretch, ensuring a taut pitch</li>
<li> Floor is 210-denier polyester oxford for durable abrasion resistance</li>

<li> Includes zippered, duffel-style stuff sack, stakes, guylines and tighteners, pole repair tube, and pole and stake bags</li>
