<h3>For trail hikes or kicking back in camp, the REI Ladro Hoodie jacket keeps you comfortable with breathability and light warmth</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Use it as an outer layer or as an extra one when the temperatures drop</li>
<li> Soft, pique-knit midweight fabric has 4-way stretch for great mobility</li>
<li> Outer face resists precipitation and light wind and dries quickly; plus it resists abrasion and pilling</li>
<li> Cozy fleece interior backing traps warm air and is soft next to skin</li>
<li> Scuba-style hood and tall collar combine to hold in warmth; hood has a drawcord to refine the fit</li>
<li> Flatlock stitching eliminates abrasion, increases comfort and enhances fit by reducing bulky seams</li>
<li> Two zip hand pockets and zip sleeve pocket with media port</li>
<li> Interior windflap; chin guard; drawcord hem; thumb loops</li>
<li> REI Ladro hoodie has a sleek, close-to-body fit to boost fabric performance</li>
</ul>
