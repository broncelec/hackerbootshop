description_list: <h4>The Brooks Flyer saddle is made from real leather and is equipped
  with springs for extra comfort on rough roads</h4><ul class="description"><li> Leather
  provides natural "give" by stretching and flexing, and because it doesn't need padding,
  it's a cool option in warm weather</li><li> The saddle will age and break in over
  time</li><li> Bag loops permit the use of a traditional English-style touring bag
  on the rear of the seat</li></ul>
