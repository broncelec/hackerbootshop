description_list: <h4>A much-anticipated Garmin power meter that measures output at
  the pedal where force is applied, Vector Power Meter Pedal Kit captures rich training
  data with unique, powerful and precise technology</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Vector measures the slight deflection of the pedal spindle through your entire pedal
  stroke, measuring the force vectors and using this data to calculate power</li><li>
  Because the force sensors are housed in each pedal, Vector can measure power from
  each leg and report total power as well as the balance between your right and left
  leg</li><li> Vector also records cadence and a variety of power metrics, which you
  can see on your compatible Garmin device (sold separately) and online with Garmin
  Connect(TM)</li><li> Also measures average power at various time intervals, power
  in watts, overall kilojoules, power zones and specialized measurements such as intensity
  and training stress</li><li> Easily transferable, you can use the same system on
  multiple bikes by simply swapping out the pedals and moving the wireless head unit</li><li>
  Installs in minutes</li><li> Please note that this pedal kit requires a compatible
