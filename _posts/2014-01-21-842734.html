  bottoms for tall men let you layer with confidence; they''re light enough for aerobic
  activity yet fit smoothly under other pieces</h4><ul class="description"><li> Polartec
  Power Dry utilizes 2 different yarns on either side of the fabric to enhance comfort:
  interior yarn wicks moisture, and exterior yarn dries quickly</li><li> The combination
  of the 2 yarns helps keep you dry during highly aerobic activities because it moves
  moisture away from skin faster than single-component fabrics such as cotton</li><li>
  Updated fabric protects skin against harmful ultraviolet light with a UPF rating
  of 20, and is very soft to the touch</li><li> Flatseam construction is soft and
  non-chafing next to skin</li><li> Brushed elastic waistband ensures a comfortable
  fit outing after outing</li><li> Functional fly</li><li> The men''s tall REI Lightweight
  Polartec Power Dry long underwear bottoms feature a next-to-skin fit that hugs the
  body and boosts fabric performance</li></ul>'
