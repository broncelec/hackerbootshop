description_list: <h4>The obvious quality of the Eddyline Caribbean 14 sit-on-top
  kayak enhances the fun of being on the water</h4><ul class="description"><li> Hop
  in and get out there! Similar to its shorter 12 ft</li><li> relative, the Eddyline
  Caribbean 14 sit-on-top kayak features additional space for accessories and a slightly
  narrower body for covering distance</li><li> Lengthened cockpit suits large paddlers
  or those looking to carry lots of gear for day trips of fishing</li><li> Unique
  hull construction offers the looks and performance of a composite kayak with the
  durability of plastic</li><li> Named Carbonite 2000 by Eddyline, a co-extruded ABS
  laminate creates a hull that rivals the qualities of fiberglass</li><li> Plastic
  is first shaped into a 2-layer sheet with durable interior and an abrasion- and
  UV-resistant exterior</li><li> Sheet is then thermorformed into the hull of the
  kayak using very high temperatures and a vacuum</li><li> This 2-layer plastic laminate
  offers incredible stiffness and a hard, glossy appearance that resists abrasion
  and impact while remaining easy to repair</li><li> Gull wing hull configuration
  provides high initial stability without sacrificing its excellent tracking or efficient
  forward motion</li><li> High-backed adjustable seat provides additional comfort
  for longer paddling excursions</li><li> Removable seat includes fittings made from
  tough but lightweight plastic instead of the typical metal buckles that can scratch
  up your kayak</li><li> Multiple hatches provide access to interior space; flat and
  accessible mounting surfaces provide ample space for mounting accessories</li><li>
  Spacious tank well is configured for a milk crate or 5 gal</li><li> pail; forward
  end of the cockpit features a platform for box storage</li><li> Retractable carry
  handles, paddle holders on both sides and multiple flat spots for accessories are
  perfect finishing touches for a fully equipped kayak you can take anywhere</li></ul>
