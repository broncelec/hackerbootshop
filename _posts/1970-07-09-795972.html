<li> Dual-density padded shoulder straps and 3-point adjustable hipbelt distribute weight to stabilize the load and ensure comfort</li>
<li> Stretched across the back, the open-air trampoline mesh Verti-Cool(TM) back panel circulates air between back and pack</li>
<li> Aluminum V-stays transfer load weight to the waist; polyethylene framesheet enhances support and provides protection</li>
<li> Top-loading system with a mesh pocket in lid stashes small essentials such as energy bars, sunglasses and sunblock</li>
