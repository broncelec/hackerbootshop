  to be cinched snug without digging into your face</li><li> Down-insulated draft

  the bag to be stuffed and unstuffed without tearing the baffle material</li><li>

  down escape</li><li> Zipper guards prevent zipper snags; locking zippers keep bag
  from opening if you toss and turn at night</li><li> Marmot Litihium Sleeping Bag
  comes with a stuff sack and a storage bag</li><li> European Norm (EN) is an independent
  third-party temperature rating, allowing accurate comparisons across brands with
