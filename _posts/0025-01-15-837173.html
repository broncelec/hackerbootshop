<h3>Built for hiking, skiing, snowshoeing or Nordic skiing, the men's REI Midweight Polartec(R) Power Dry(R) crew offers the perfect mix of warmth and comfort</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Polartec Power Dry utilizes 2 different yarns on either side of the fabric to enhance comfort: interior yarn wicks moisture, and exterior yarn dries quickly</li>
<li> Combination of the 2 yarns helps keep you dry during highly aerobic activities because it moves moisture away from skin faster than single-component fabrics such as cotton</li>
<li> Fabric offers UPF rating of 30 to protect against harmful UV light</li>
<li> Flatseam construction is soft and non-chafing next to skin, and raglan seams are designed to work with pack straps at shoulders</li>
<li> Underarm and side gussets promote freedom of motion and reduce chafing under a hipbelt</li>
<li> Additional length helps garment stay tucked in, and smooth texture of outer surface makes it easy to slide on extra layers</li>
<li> The men's REI Midweight Polartec Power Dry crew features a next-to-skin fit that hugs the body</li>
</ul>
