description_list: <h4>The Coleman(R) Fold 'N Go two-burner stove is approximately
  25% more compact than traditional two-burner stoves, for easy portability! Although
  smaller, it is every bit as powerful, delivering 10,000 BTUs per side, the same
  power rating as many Coleman stoves</h4><ul class="description"><li> Each burner
  is fully adjustable from a fine simmer to all-out boiling and frying temperatures</li><li>
  The 13-inch spread between burners accommodates large skillets and pots, making
  the stove perfect for camping, picnics and patio usage</li><li> Chrome-plated heavy-gauge
  wire grates support a variety of pot sizes; aluminized steel cooking surfaces make
  clean-up a cinch</li><li> Plus, the electronic ignition brings push-button ease
  to lighting burners, which in turn are easily managed by dual control knobs</li><li>
  Uses standard 16</li><li>4-ounce propane cylinders (not included); features a pressure
  regulator for consistent performance thoughout the life of the cylinder</li><li>
  Due to flammable item shipping restrictions, we cannot sell fuel canisters online;
  they are available at REI retail stores</li></ul>
