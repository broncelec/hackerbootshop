description_list: <h4>Built with the lightweight construction of the K2 WayBack skis,
  the K2 BackDrop telemark/randonee skis have chubbier waists to conquer the deepest
  pow and leave you with energy for a second lap</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  All-terrain rocker features elevated tips that float through powder snow with ease;
  traditional camber underfoot ensures good power and edge hold on firm snow</li><li>
  Cores combine aspen, paulownia and maple woods to create skis that are stable and
  predictable underfoot and light and soft in the tips and tails</li><li> Located
  at the tips and tails, a weave of carbon improves responsiveness and edge grip without
  adding much weight</li><li> Triaxial braiding wraps an interlocking fiberglass weave
  around the wood core providing torsional stiffness, responsive turning and high
  sensitivity</li><li> Cap construction envelops the cores and internal materials
  with the top layers of the skis, keeping overall weight light and durability high</li><li>
  Powder tips place the widest point of the skis farther back than on other K2 skis,
  making the skis more stable and predictable in variable snow conditions</li><li>
  Top sheets feature a hydrophobic material similar to what is used on the bases to
  prevent snow from sticking and building up while you're skinning</li><li> Flat tails
  let you easily plunge your skis into firm snow when building anchors or staking
  out a tent</li><li> Low-profile tip grommets accommodate Z-Clip attachments on K2
  climbing skins (sold separately)</li><li> Concave notches in the tails of the K2
  BackDrop skis keep non-K2-brand skins securely centered on the tails</li><li> Base
  or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
