description_list: '<h4>Wearing a warm, wicking base layer like the men''s tall REI
  Midweight Polartec(R) Power Dry(R) crew in cold weather can make the difference
  between days to remember and those to forget</h4><ul class="description"><li> Sleeves
  are 1</li><li>5 in</li><li> longer and hem is 2 in</li><li> longer than the regular
  REI Midweight Polartec Power crew</li><li> Polartec Power Dry uses 2 different yarns
  on either side of the fabric to enhance comfort: interior yarn wicks moisture, and
  exterior yarn dries quickly</li><li> Combination of the 2 yarns helps keep you dry
  during highly aerobic activities because it moves moisture away from skin faster
  than single-component fabrics such as cotton</li><li> Fabric offers a UPF rating
  of 30 to protect against harmful UV light</li><li> Flatseam construction is soft
  and non-chafing next to skin, and raglan seams are designed to be comfortable when
  wearing pack straps on your shoulders</li><li> Underarm and side gussets promote
  freedom of motion and reduce chafing under a hipbelt</li><li> Longer length helps
  top stay tucked in, and smooth texture of outer surface helps it slide easily under
  extra layers</li><li> The REI Midweight Polartec Power Dry crew in men''s tall sizes
  features a next-to-skin fit that hugs the body</li></ul>'
