description_list: '<h4>The REI Lightweight Polartec(R) Power Dry(R) crew shirt performs
  well as a base layer underneath other insulating layers or on its own when wearing
  it in warmer temperatures</h4><ul class="description"><li> Polartec Power Dry utilizes
  2 different yarns on either side of the fabric to enhance comfort: interior yarn
  wicks moisture, and exterior yarn dries quickly</li><li> The combination of the
  2 yarns helps keep you dry during highly aerobic activities because it moves moisture
  away from skin faster than single-component fabrics such as cotton</li><li> Updated
  fabric protects skin against harmful ultraviolet light with a UPF rating of 20,
  and is very soft to the touch</li><li> Flatseam construction is soft and non-chafing
  next to skin, and seams are designed to work with pack straps at shoulders</li><li>
  Underarm and side gussets promote freedom of motion</li><li> Dropped back hem stays
  tucked in; sleeves are long enough to cover biceps</li><li> The REI Lightweight
  Polartec Power Dry crew features a next-to-skin fit that hugs the body and boosts
  fabric performance</li></ul>'
