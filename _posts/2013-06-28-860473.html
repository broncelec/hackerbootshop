  and they offer an advanced DIN range of 4 - 13</li><li> Each binding moves 3cm forward
  or 3cm back using a simple screw adjustment on the toe piece</li><li> Position the

  powder skis; mounting configuration of the Marker Griffon Schizo downhill ski bindings
  requires a 76mm minimum ski width</li></ul>'
