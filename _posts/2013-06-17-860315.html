description_list: <h4>Rockered powder skis you can use in chopped-up crud, wind-blown
  snow and even crust, the Volkl One skis feature 116mm waists and a tapered sidecut
  at tips and tails for maneuverability</h4><ul class="description"><li> Full rocker
  increases maneuverability in deep snow, making turns in powder effortless and adding
  a surflike, floaty feel</li><li> The smooth, gradual rocker from tip to tail also
  creates uninterrupted edge contact on groomed runs so you can deftly maneuver these
  wide-waisted powder skis back to the lifts</li><li> Early taper in the tip and tail
  allows the ski to transition easily from turn to turn instead of the automatic turn
  initiation and hooking that happens with a standard sidecut</li><li> Multilayer
  wooden core uses dense ash under the bindings to ensure screws won't come loose
  during harsh landings</li><li> Soft poplar in the remainder of the skis makes them
  snappy and responsive</li><li> Tough Box construction sheathes the wood core in
  composite and fiberglass to remain durable during high speed landings and to snap
  back quickly from aggressive turns</li><li> Carbon laminate in the bottom layer
  of the core stabilizes the ride and further enhances durability</li><li> Stiff flex
  zone in front adds stability, and medium flex underfoot transitions to the soft
  tail that aids in turning on groomers and maneuvering in pow</li><li> Directional
  twin tip heavily favors skiing forward but allows you to ski and land jumps backward
  if needed</li><li> Volkl One skis feature 116mm waists that require bindings with
  wide brakes</li><li> Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
