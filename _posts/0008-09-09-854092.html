<h3>The North Face Radish Mid Layer stretch fleece jacket fits the bill for a warm mid layer that's made for outdoor adventures</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Lightweight and incredibly versatile, you'll want to take it on every trip</li>
<li> Pontetorto hard-face stretch fleece is extraordinarily durable and the soft, brushed interior wicks moisture away from you</li>
<li> FlashDry(TM) fabric additive dramatically improves drying time and breathability without adding weight or bulk or washing out</li>
<li> Made of crushed coconut shells and crushed volcanic rock, FlashDry moves moisture from one layer to another to keep you dry</li>
<li> Fitted hood follows your head as you turn it, allowing an unobstructed view</li>
<li> The Radish Mid Layer jacket sports reinforced shoulder and hip zones for protection from backpack abrasion</li>
<li> Flatlock stitching increases comfort and enhances fit when layering</li>
<li> Roomy chest pocket is sleek thanks to its laser-cut bonded (rather than stitched) construction</li>
<li> The North Face Summit Series(TM) apparel is designed and tested for use in harsh environments</li>
<li> Closeout</li>
</ul>
