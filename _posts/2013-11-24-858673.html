description_list: '<h4>With a shell that contours your foot shape and top-notch Intuition
  ID liners that mold to your feet, the stiff, expert-level Dalbello KR Two Pro I</h4><ul
  class="description"><li>D</li><li> ski boots balance comfort with precision</li><li>
  Boot mold enhances power, precision and comfort by matching 4 critical fit points:
  the heels, ankles, 5th metatarsals near your toes and the naviculars near insteps</li><li>
  98mm footbed provides a responsive, precision fit designed for discriminating feet</li><li>
  Among the highest-quality liners available, the anatomically shaped Intuition I</li><li>D</li><li>
  liners offer a low-volume, performance fit that improves sensitivity and responsiveness</li><li>
  High-density Ultralon EVA foam in the Intuition ID liners is lighter and warmer
  than standard foams and can be shaped to accommodate specific fit issues</li><li>
  Offering a precise foothold and a progressive forward flex, 3-piece shell optimizes
  responsiveness for modern ski shapes</li><li> Separate cuff, shell and tongue sections
  are joined together to create a smooth forward flex with precise side-to-side support</li><li>
  Enhancing side-to-side response and providing a snugger wrap, bi-injected cuffs
  feature stiff plastic on sides and soft plastic on the straps that wrap around shins</li><li>
  Tweak the fit with 2 interchangeable tongues (stiff installed and medium included),
  2 interchangable footboards (firm installed and antishock included)</li><li> Twin
  canting adjusts the cuffs to fit the angles of your lower legs, levels the soles
  of the boots above the skis and offers a versatile range of adjustment</li><li>
  Cable instep buckle on each boot minimizes foot sliding, heel lift and shell distortion
  while flexing, and a specialized adjustment fine-tunes the cable tension</li></ul>'
