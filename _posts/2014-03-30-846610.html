description_list: <h4>The Big Agnes Slater UL1+ tent gets its inspiration from the
  Fly Creek UL series tents</h4><ul class="description"><li> The Slater is light and
  fast like the Fly Creek, but comes with extra floor space and the absence of mesh</li><li>
  Extra space comes at little cost in terms of weight, and the lightweight, breathable
  ripstop nylon walls offer an extra bit of warmth, privacy and protection</li><li>
  Lightweight and strong DAC Featherlite(R) NSL poles with press-fit connectors and
  a lightweight hub use an anodization process with fewer chemicals than other processes</li><li>
  DAC Twist clips attach tent body to the pole frame for quick and easy set up</li><li>
  Color-coded pole ends, webbing and buckles make setting up the Big Agnes Slater
  UL1+ tent effortless</li><li> Woven nylon mesh tent door helps ventilate tent; ripstop
  nylon walls are especially effective at keeping the sand and wind out of the tent
  when you head to the desert</li><li> Rainfly and seamless floor are made of polyurethane-
  and silicone-coated high-tenacity ripstop nylon; seams are taped with waterproof,
  solvent-free polyurethane tape</li><li> Stormflap over vestibule zipper prevents
  water drips</li><li> Fly vent improves ventilation to reduce condensation; reflective
  guyout and reflective webbing on tent corners increase visibility at night</li><li>
  Includes interior mesh pockets and gear loft loops for storage; 11 superlight aluminum
  stakes and stuff sacks also included</li><li> For a lightweight setup during nice
  weather leave tent body behind; use the rainfly and footprint (sold separately)
  with the poles and stakes</li></ul>
