<h3>Trail-worthy and affordable, the REI Lookout 40 pack comfortably handles a broad range of outdoor adventures, whether you're enjoying a cool forest hike or a done-in-a-day summit scramble</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Updated shoulder straps and hipbelt provide a soft and ergonomic fit while stiff load-carrying sections preserve comfort under heavy loads</li>
<li> FreeFlow back panel features multiple ventilation channels that allow cool air to flow across your back</li>
<li> Spring steel frame transfers weight to the hipbelt and stabilizes the load from unwanted side-to-side movement; perimeter design allows the back panel to conform to your back</li>
<li> Panel-loading main compartment makes it easy to organize your gear; bottom zipper adds easy access</li>
<li> Hydration pocket can be accessed from the pack's exterior, allowing you quick access to refill your reservoir (sold separately) without digging into your pack</li>
<li> Small zippered pocket with soft lining provides an ideal spot for storing delicate items such as sunglasses or electronics</li>
<li> Innovative water-bottle pocket design allows a bottle to be stored in an easy-to-reach position, then rotated and locked in place for secure storage</li>
<li> Trekking pole attachments feature adjustable lower loops that capture the pole tips, while an elastic quick-clip securely fastens your poles to the pack</li>
<li> Simple, pulley-style side compression straps compress more of the bag than traditional single straps and with less extra weight and material than dual straps</li>
<li> Quick-release compression straps on the bottom provide an easy attachment point for sit pads or other bulky items</li>
<li> Lightweight lash points allow additional gear to be strapped to the front of the pack</li>
<li> The REI Lookout 40 pack features a thermoplastic elastomer bottom panel that provides waterproof durability to withstand years of heavy use</li>
