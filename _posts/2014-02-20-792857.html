description_list: <h4>Updated and improved, the REI Double Shot Press Mug lets you
  enjoy 2 mugs of terrific-tasting coffee when you want, where you want! Updated to
  include a more durable handle, a new French-press lid with a sliding sip-hole closure
  and a more secure fit for the included air-tight canister</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Included air-tight canister securely stores away ground coffee in the base of the
  mug, ensuring that you'll never be without a second round</li><li> To brew coffee,
  simply put your fresh ground coffee in the mug, add hot (not boiling) water, steep,
  press the plunger and sip-it's that easy! Double-wall stainless-steel construction
  ensures your coffee stays enjoyably hot and fresh for long periods of time</li><li>
  French-press mechanism comes with its own commuter-style cap with a screen over
  the sip hole to keep grounds inside; you can close off the sip hole with the sliding
  mechanism</li><li> Or, when using the mug for tea or coffee from a conventional
  pot, use the secondary commuter cap with sliding sip-hole closure</li><li> Mug features
  a beefy handle to accommodate large hands and a narrow base to fit most cars' cup
  holders; clip the handle to a pack with an accessory carabiner (sold separately)</li><li>
  2 rubber gaskets encircle the mug to cut down on vibration noise while in a cup
  holder and reduce shock to the system if tipped</li></ul>
