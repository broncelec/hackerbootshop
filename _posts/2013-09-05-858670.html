  work for the Dalbello Boss ski boots</h4><ul class="description"><li> They feature
  an intermediate-level freeride flex and built-in shock absorbers</li><li> Shock-absorbent
  cuff inserts make big-air landings a little easier on the shins, and shock-absorbent
  heel inserts make them a bit easier on your feet as well</li><li> Dalbello Boss
  boots feature a 3-piece shell design that ensures a precise foothold and a smooth,
  progressive flex as you bend your knees into the turn</li><li> Separate cuff, shell
  and tongue sections are joined together to create a smooth forward flex with rigid
  lateral support</li><li> Comfy liners feature medium-density foam around the rear
  feet and tongues and stretchy toe boxes</li><li> Liners are engineered to fit correctly
  right out of the box, but they can be custom formed as well, a procedure best performed
  in an REI specialty ski shop</li><li> Medium flex index of 100 - 110 provides the
  responsive power transfer suited to progressing intermediate skiers</li><li> Vary
  flex by adjusting the tension of top buckle and power strap</li><li> Cable instep
  buckle on each boot minimizes foot sliding, heel lift and shell distortion while
  flexing</li></ul>
