description_list: <h4>Ridiculously fun to ride whether zipping down groomers, floating
  through powder or throwing down frontside 180s, the Jones Mountain Twin snowboard
  is your ticket to all-mountain fun</h4><ul class="description"><li> Twin profile
  and blunt nose keep you floating while the mellow Magne-Traction locks in stability
  when the fresh tracks are gone</li><li> Mellow Magne-Traction improves edge grip
  by adding five contact points along the running length of the board, resulting in
  amazing control whether riding ice or pow</li><li> Camrock, a distinctive rocker/camber
  flex pattern, evenly balances tip and tail rocker and slight camber between the
  bindings</li><li> Full wood core is comfortable and robust; it's a true all-terrain
  core and certified by the Forest Stewardship Council; fiberglass enhances the flex
  and board feel</li><li> Carbon stringers improve pop and torsional stiffness, and
  increase the longevity of the flex profile</li><li> Film topsheet saves weight over
  traditional plastic topsheets; sintered base absorbs and retains wax; steel edges</li><li>
  P-tex waste is drastically reduced by flip-flopping base graphic colors between
  boards; base colors are random, thus specific requests cannot be accommodated</li><li>
