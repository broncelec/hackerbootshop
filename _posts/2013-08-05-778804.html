description_list: <h4>SLX M662 is a 9-speed, top-normal rear derailleur that features
  Shimano Shadow RD design for superior trail clearance and crisp shifting</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> Shadow RD design is intended for aggressive riding; a low
  profile and single-tension construction prevent the derailleur from hitting the
  chainstay in rough riding conditions</li><li> The result is smooth, silent performance
  and increased shifting durability</li><li> Straight cable design ensures crisp and
  accurate shifting</li><li> Strong guide spring prevents chainstay contact</li><li>
  11-tooth pulleys run quieter and wear longer than typical derailleurs thanks to
  alternating tooth contact between inner and outer chain plates</li><li> Fluorine-coated
  2-pin bushings reduce link-pin friction resulting in reduced shifting effort</li></ul>
