description_list: <h4>Featuring low weight, smooth lines and a feel that will make
  you one with the ocean, the Current Designs Vision 130 Comp kayak is a responsive
  boat that's designed for the smaller paddler</h4><ul class="description"><li> Offering
  superb performance and a confidence-inspiring feel, the Current Designs Vision 130
  Comp kayak is slightly more nimble than its 15 ft</li><li> counterpart</li><li>
  Unusually lightweight, strong and stiff, the Vision 130 features a hybrid construction
  of fiberglass and a polyaramid (the same material found in Kevlar(R))</li><li> Vacuum-bagged
  composite lamination eliminates excess resin, which improves strength and reduces
  weight to a mere 40 lbs</li><li> 13 ft</li><li> length offers tracking and maneuverability,
  and 24 in</li><li> width provides stability</li><li> Swede-form construction enhances
  speed and maneuverability, and it allows bow to punch through waves instead of riding
  up and over them</li><li> Shallow-V hull enhances tracking and offers friendly stability
  and a lively feel in the water; low decks minimize wind resistance</li><li> Keyhole-shape
  cockpit is easy to enter and exit, and integrated foam thighbraces on interior coaming
  increase comfort when bracing or carving turns</li><li> Seat creates a natural,
  comfortable paddling position by tilting the entire seat pan up and away from cockpit
  floor</li><li> Use the lever-lock knob-similar to a quick-release fork on a bike
  wheel-to set the seat pan to the desired height</li><li> Locking mechanism prevents
  both side-to-side and up-and-down motion</li><li> To prevent numbness, seat pan
  features a contoured space for lower vertebrae and is covered with plush, nonabsorbent,
  very thick padding</li><li> Seat back moves up and down and back and forth, and
  it articulates to move with your paddling motion</li><li> Sliding bar adjusts foot
  pegs without having to get out and reach inside cockpit</li><li> Rear hatch provides
  enough storage for an overnight trip and features an easy-to-use, rubberized hatch
  cover</li></ul>
