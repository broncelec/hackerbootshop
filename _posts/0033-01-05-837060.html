<h3>The North Face Oso hoodie combines the performance and style of the epic Denali jacket with a soft hood for a blend of style and comfort that toddlers will love</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Polyester fleece with a silky-soft surface keeps her warm without weighing her down</li>
<li> Lightweight fabric resists pilling and fading, packs easily and maintains its shape</li>
<li> Reinforced shoulder panels repel light precipitation; tricot-lined pockets warm chilly hands</li>
</ul>
