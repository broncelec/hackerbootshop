  This board will change the way you ride; it's that amazing</li><li> Hybrid LowRize(TM)
  rocker features a micro camber section between your feet and rocker at the nose
  and tail, making the board equally at home in the park and on the steeps</li><li>
  Twin shape places you in a centered stance for a balanced ride whether riding regular
  or switch</li><li> Lightweight Aspen core incorporates bamboo to provide a perfect

  and smooth the interaction between the board and riding surface; plus, as a bonus,

  "detuned" to enlarge board's turning radii</li><li> Ride Machete GT snowboard features
