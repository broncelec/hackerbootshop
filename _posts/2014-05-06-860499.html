description_list: <h4>With dual drivers that let you hear and feel impressive bass,
  the Skullcandy Crusher headphones serve up a realistic music experience of vibrating
  deep notes and clear, undistorted sound</h4><ul class="description"><li> Custom-tuned
  primary driver produces supreme sound with smooth frequency response and minimal
  distortion</li><li> Unlike single-driver units that try to simulate bass with digital
  signal processing, Crusher features a second driver that triggers a vibration system
  for bass you can feel</li><li> Acoustical porting within the ear cups allows both
  drivers to move freely, further enhancing bass and reducing distortion</li><li>

  from a user-replaceable AA battery in the ear cup that offers up to 40 hrs</li><li>
  of play time</li><li> Bass sensation slider on the left ear cup offers adjustable
  bass control; quickly choose your preferred level of vibration or turn it completely
  off</li><li> Automatic on/off smart circuit eliminates the need for a power switch;

  sec</li><li> Once you restore the music source, the amp will automatically power
  up</li><li> Ergonomic flexibility, clamping pressure and soft-touch synthetic leather
  ear pillows deliver long-lasting comfort and an effective seal around your ears
