<h3>Don't let cold temps put a damper on the the fun</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> With GORE-TEX(R) waterproofness and PrimaLoft(R) insulation, The North Face Steep Saiku gloves keep your hands warm on backcountry ski trips</li>
<li> Waterproof, highly breathable GORE-TEX inserts keep your hands dependably dry and comfortable</li>
<li> PrimaLoft(R) One is a patented ultrafine microfiber blend that offers downlike softness, and is incredibly lightweight and water repellent</li>
<li> 100g insulation on the palms and 150g on the backs of the hands keeps your fingers warm when you're skiing down cold, snowy slopes</li>
<li> Palms are lined with polyester with a FlashDry(TM) fabric additive that dramatically improves drying time and breathability without adding weight or bulk or washing out</li>
<li> Removable wrist wraps inside the gloves are designed to hold hand warmer packets (sold separately) to warm blood as it flows to your hands</li>
<li> 5 Dimensional Fit(TM) uses 5 measurements of the hand to construct gloves with an accurate and consistent fit</li>
<li> Radiametric Articulation(TM) improves warmth and blood flow to your fingers by mirroring the natural relaxed curve of the hand</li>
<li> The North Face Steep Saiku gloves have water-resistant cowhide leather exteriors that stand up to regular use and provide great grip</li>
