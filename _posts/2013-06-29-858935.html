description_list: <h4>As classic touring skis, the Black Diamond Stigma telemark/randonee
  skis are lightweight, nimble-but-stable performers from the skin track to tight,
  technical couloirs</h4><ul class="description"><li> Part of the Tour series, the
  Stigma specializes in long approaches and technical descents on both soft and hard
  snow</li><li> Lightweight paulownia wood core is surrounded by Torsion Box construction
  and carbon fiber reinforcements</li><li> Torsion Box technology wraps fiberglass
  around the core like a burrito, creating excellent torsional power and energy pop</li><li>
  Dual Torsion Bow(R) construction features two ribs that run the length of each ski
  to distribute loads</li><li> Soft tip flex pattern and a tight turning radius with
  80mm waists make the Stigma skis ideal for quick turns on variable snow</li><li>
  Feature flat tails you can easily plunge into firm snow when building anchors or
  staking out a tent</li><li> Stainless-steel notches at the tails keep climbing skins
  (not included) securely attached and centered</li><li> Black Diamond Stigma skis
  have high-speed sintered bases that feature a cross-hatch stone grind for a balance
  of durability, glide and maintenance</li><li> Base or topsheet color may vary from
