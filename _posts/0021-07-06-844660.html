<h3>The streamlined REI Flash 45 pack balances minimal weight with maximum comfort and convenience</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> It's the perfect companion for a long weekend of fast and light backpacking</li>
<li> Molded, mesh-covered EVA back panel rivals heavier packs with its comfort and ventilation; shoulder straps are made with perforated foam, allowing sweat vapor to pass through</li>
<li> Aluminum headrail teams up with 2 flexible Delrin rods to offer genuine load transfer to the hips, which is virtually unheard of in a pack this light! Spacious main compartment features a hydration sleeve (reservoir sold separately); floating top lid extends to accommodate bulky items and larger loads</li>
<li> Floating front pocket offers adaptable and generous storage, fitting a wide array of contents such as rain gear or water bottles</li>
<li> Zippered hipbelt pockets offer immediate access to snacks and other small items</li>
<li> Lightweight lash points allow additional gear to be strapped to the outside of the pack; quick-clip bungee loops let you secure an ice axe or trekking poles</li>
<li> The REI Flash 45 pack features side and top compression straps that help pull the load close to your body and provide attachment points for additional gear</li>
</ul>
