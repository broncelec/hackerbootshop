description_list: <h4>Ready for powder to packed and back again, the Line Soulmate
  98 women's skis use a stable metal laminate in the core and nimble rockered tips
  to shred anywhere you choose to go</h4><ul class="description"><li> Rockered tips
  float effortlessly in deep powder and offer easy turn initiation on the hardpack</li><li>
  Die-cut metal laminate enhances edge-grip and increases torsional responsiveness
  in the tips</li><li> Aspen core consists of a blend of high-quality wood laminates
  that reduce weight and enhance overall strength</li><li> Cap construction on top
  of skis blends light responsiveness with the durability and solid feel of sidewalls</li><li>
  Directional twin-tip design slightly favors skiing forward but allows you to ski
  and land backward if desired</li><li> Extra-thick bases and edges add significant
  durability and impact resistance, and let you tune your skis many times throughout
  the season</li><li> Line Soulmate 98 women's skis feature 98mm waists that require
  bindings with wide brakes</li><li> Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
