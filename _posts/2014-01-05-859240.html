  you to take on the whole mountain</h4><ul class="description"><li> All-terrain rockered
  tips excel in soft snow and deliver fluid performance on hardpack</li><li> When
  put on edge, 95% of the skis' edge length contacts the snow for precision on groomed
  runs</li><li> Composite foam core damps vibrations to keep the ride smooth, and
  its responsive feel allows for precise control</li><li> Bamboo fibers add natural
  flex and pop, and single titanium laminate adds torsional rigidity and instant edge-to-edge
  responsiveness</li><li> Damping system enhances stability at high speeds</li><li>
  Elastomer inserts placed over the edges absorb vibrations, resulting in a smooth
  ride that softens ski-to-snow contact</li><li> Integrated bindings automatically
  adjust height and width at critical boot contact points, resulting in superior fit,
  snow feel and control</li><li> Lightweight bindings enhance energy transmission
  and ski responsiveness, and bindings are mounted slightly forward to accommodate
  a woman's center of gravity</li><li> 3 - 10 DIN range accommodates a wide range
  of skier abilities</li><li> Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
