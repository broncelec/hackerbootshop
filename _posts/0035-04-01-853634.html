<h3>When it's too cold for a base layer alone and too warm to add a heavy jacket, the men's REI Winterflyte Windshirt offers just the right amount of warmth for cross-country skiing</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> This mid layer is body-mapped to optimize performance, combining a windproof/waterproof front panel with breathable, wicking, fast-drying fabric on the back and sleeves</li>
<li> The windshirt's front panel also offers 4-way stretch for ease of movement</li>
<li> Thumbhole cuffs ensure arms stay fully covered when your skiing pace picks up</li>
<li> Long front zipper allows ventilation adjustment when you heat up; the locking zipper won't bounce around as you move</li>
<li> Flat seams minimize chafing; ergonomic seam placement also lets you move comfortably</li>
<li> Zippered chest pocket with headphone port can secure your music player</li>
<li> The men's REI Winterflyte Windshirt also has reflective trim that increases visibility in low light</li>
</ul>
