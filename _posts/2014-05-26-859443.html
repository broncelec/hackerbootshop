  Uniform-density plastic shells ensure highly efficient power transfer, smooth flex
  and finely-tuned responsiveness, even in frigid temperatures</li><li> Shells, liners
  and snug, 100mm footbeds are based on a composite scan of thousands of skiers' feet

  balanced stance on rockered skis to increase efficiency of technique and reduce
  fatigue</li><li> Control Fit liners conform to your feet for a comfortable, high-performance
  fit; liners may be custom molded using a heat treatment</li><li> Specially designed
  insteps provide an excellent fit at the midfoot, resulting in increased circulation
  and greater warmth</li><li> 1-piece toe boxes and tongues eliminate seams and overlaps
  in the tongue-attachment area to reduce pressure points at the instep and top of
  the toes</li><li> Elastic 40mm power straps; rubber soles offer excellent grip</li></ul>
