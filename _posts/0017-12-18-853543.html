<h3>Combining feminine style with a waterproof, breathable and insulated design, the Kira Triclimate 3-in-1 jacket by The North Face offers weather-customizable versatility for season-long wear</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Three different ways to wear the system: wear shell jacket and zip-in liner jacket together for maximum protection or wear either piece on its own as weather warrants</li>
<li> HyVent(TM) 2-layer construction is waterproof, windproof and breathable; fully sealed seams prevent moisture from seeping through</li>
<li> Powder skirt with gripping elastic keeps snow out; snaps let you integrate the powder skirt with compatible pants by The North Face (sold separately)</li>
<li> Chest pocket; zip handwarmer pockets; wrist pocket with goggles cloth; internal goggles pocket</li>
<li> Cinch adjustable hem and rip-and-stick wrist cuffs help seal out cold air and retain valuable warmth; core vents let you control airflow and your comfort</li>
<li> Fully adjustable, removable and helmet-compatible hood ensures a weather-blocking, personalized fit</li>
<li> The North Face Kira Triclimate zip-in/out liner jacket uses Heatseeker(TM) polyester fiber insulation to keep you warm without inhibiting movement</li>
<li> Liner jacket has zippered handwarmer pockets and an internal media pocket for convenience when wearing liner on its own</li>
<li> Easy zip-in system mates the liner jacket and shell jacket together for added warmth and allows easy reach-in access to the shell's interior features</li>
</ul>
