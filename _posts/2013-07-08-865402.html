description_list: <h4>Inspired by the Fly Creek UL line, the ultralight, 3-season
  Big Agnes Slater UL3+ tent offers the same light and fast design for three backpackers,
  plus extra floor space and less canopy mesh</h4><ul class="description"><li> Extra
  space comes at little cost in terms of weight; lightweight, breathable ripstop nylon
  walls offer extra warmth, privacy and protection</li><li> Light and strong DAC Featherlite(R)
  NSL poles, press-fit connectors and a lightweight hub use an anodization process
  with fewer chemicals than other processes</li><li> DAC twist clips and color-coded
  pole ends, webbing and buckles make setting up the Big Agnes Slater UL3+ quick and
  easy</li><li> Woven nylon mesh in the upper canopy provides ventilation; ripstop
  nylon helps keep sand and wind out of the tent when you head to the desert</li><li>
  Polyurethane- and silicone-coated high-tenacity ripstop nylon fly and floor; waterproof,
  solvent-free polyurethane tape seals all seams</li><li> Fly vent improves ventilation
  to reduce condensation; stormflap over vestibule zipper prevents water drips</li><li>
  Reflective guyouts and reflective webbing on tent corners increase visibility at
  night</li><li> 5 interior mesh pockets and gear loft loops (gear loft sold separately)
  accommodate storage</li><li> For a lightweight setup during nice weather leave tent
  body behind; use the rainfly and footprint (sold separately) with the poles and
  stakes</li><li> The Big Agnes Slater UL3+ tent comes with 15 superlight aluminum
  J stakes and stuff sacks</li></ul>
