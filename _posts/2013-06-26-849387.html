description_list: <h4>Lithe and lightning fast, the Mavic Crossmax SLR 29er Disc mountain
  bike wheelset is built to meet the demands of cross-country racing</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Proprietary lighweight aluminum rims have a drilling method that doesn't penetrate
  the tube-facing wall, enhancing wheel strength and rigidity</li><li> This drilling
  method also allows UST tubeless compatibility, offering all the benefits of tubeless
  with the option of using a traditional tube/tire setup</li><li> Inter Spoke Milling
  3D dramatically reduces material between spokes and along sides of rims, reducing
  weight and making them well-suited to climbing and fast acceleration</li><li> Rim
  joints are welded and milled to maximize strength, rigidity and wheel balance while
  also offering a smooth finish</li><li> Rear hub uses Instant Transfer System 4 freewheel
  design to supply fast engagement via 4 pawls, ensuring your energy is transferred
  to the wheel quickly and efficiently</li><li> Double-sealed cartridge bearings deliver
  excellent longevity and smooth spinning; microadjustability lets you fine-tune bearing
  loads to optimize your ride</li><li> Both wheels use 20 lightweight, straight-pull
  and bladed Zicral alloy spokes; front is laced 2-cross while rear uses radial lacing
  on drive-side and 2-cross on non-drive-side</li><li> Front hub is compatible with
  either 15mm thru-axle or traditional 9mm quick-release; rear hub is compatible with
  9mm or 12mm axles, 135mm or 142mm axle widths</li><li> Mavic Crossmax SLR 29er Disc
