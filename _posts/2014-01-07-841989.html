description_list: <h4>The Marker Duke EPF randonee bindings won't limit the type of
  terrain you can ski</h4><ul class="description"><li> The tough Dukes are built to
  handle high-speed sidecountry adventures with cliff jumps and backcountry bumps</li><li>
  Extended Power Frame (EPF) design is 28% wider than the previous version of the
  Duke to increase power transmission to your fat powder skis</li><li> You won't prerelease
  in these burly bindings-DIN 6 - 16 adjustment lets hard-charging skiers stomp huge
  landings and hit mach speeds</li><li> Switch between downhill and touring mode using
  the levers located under your boots; lever position eliminates the chance of accidentally
  switching to touring mode while skiing</li><li> When you switch to touring mode,
  the whole binding interface moves back 4cm for better balance while climbing and
  doing kick turns</li><li> Climbing heel design offers 3 positions-flat, 7deg and
  13deg; positions can be easily adjusted using a ski pole</li><li> Gliding antifriction
  devices at the toes of the bindings are height adjustable to accommodate randonee
  and alpine boots</li><li> Low 36mm stand height creates a solid and secure connection
  to the ski</li><li> Included 110mm brakes fit wide skis and effectively stop runaway
  skis; brakes can be easily removed if desired</li><li> Mounting configuration of
  the Marker Duke EPF randonee bindings requires a 89mm minimum ski width</li><li>
  Large fits boot sole lengths from 305mm - 365mm</li></ul>
