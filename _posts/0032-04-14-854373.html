  an epic climb to basecamp, alpine touring in a powder-filled bowl or pushing the
  pace on a snowshoe trek</h4><ul class="description"><li> eVent fabric has a unique
  membrane structure that allows sweat vapor to easily pass through the fabric; so
  you can go all out, yet stay drier and enjoy chill-free rest stops</li><li> eVent
  technology works so efficiently, no pit zippers are needed; all seams are sealed
  for complete waterproof protection; the shell is also windproof to 60+ mph</li><li>

  detectors for quicker acquisition of position in the event of an avalanche</li><li>

  system also snugs down to fit over your head alone</li><li> 2-way front zipper lets
  you adjust fit and venting; zipper is backed by a stormflap and topped by a chin
  guard</li><li> Adjustable hem drawcord and rip-and-stick cuff tabs let you fine-tune
  the fit</li><li> 2 zippered, mesh-lined front pockets are placed to clear hipbelt;

  inner cord port</li><li> The REI Havenpass jacket also has 2 inner stretch-mesh
