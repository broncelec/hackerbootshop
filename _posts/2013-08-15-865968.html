description_list: <h4>The Scarpa Instinct Lace Climbing Shoes are great all-arounders,
  and feature a down-turned design that allows purchase on holds that are otherwise
  nonexistent</h4><ul class="description"><li> Suede uppers in a lace-up design mold
  to your feet, offering control and support for routes that demand precision and
  edging power</li><li> Bi-tension randing, which actively pulls power from the toes
  rather than cramming your toes painfully forward, gives performance with less tension</li><li>
  Vibram(R) XS Edge rubber melds excellent grip with good durability and edge hold</li><li>
  The Scarpa Instinct Lace Climbing Shoes have rubber patches on the tops of the toes
  that provide grip when you're crack climbing</li></ul>
