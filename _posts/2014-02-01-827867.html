description_list: '<h4>The REI Lightweight Polartec(R) Power Dry(R) crew can be worn
  alone or used as a performance insulation layer</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Polartec Power Dry utilizes 2 different yarns on either side of the fabric to enhance
  comfort: interior yarn wicks moisture, and exterior yarn dries quickly</li><li>
  Updated fabric protects skin against harmful ultraviolet light with a UPF rating
  of 20 and is very soft to the touch</li><li> Flatseam construction is soft and non-chafing
  next to skin, and seams are designed to work with pack straps at shoulders</li><li>
  The combination of the 2 yarns helps keep you dry during highly aerobic activities
  because it moves moisture away from skin faster than single-component fabrics such
  as cotton</li><li> Underarm and side gussets promote freedom of motion</li><li>
  Dropped back hem stays tucked in; sleeves are long enough to cover biceps</li><li>
  The REI Lightweight Polartec Power Dry crew features a next-to-skin fit that hugs
  the body and boosts fabric performance</li></ul>'
