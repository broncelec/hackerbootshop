description_list: <h4>The CamelBak Groove(TM) Insulated Filter bottle turns potable
  tap water into great-tasting water and keeps it cool so you can enjoy it at home,
  in the office or on the go</h4><ul class="description"><li> Simply fill the bottle
  with tap water, screw the cap on and start sipping; the integrated plant-based carbon
  filter reduces chlorine taste and odors found in tap water</li><li> Filter lasts
  for about 3 mos</li><li> or 48 gal</li><li> of water and is an easy way to enjoy
  tap water rather than purchasing disposable bottles of water</li><li> CamelBak Groove
  Filter bottle should be used to improve the taste of safe water sources only; filter
  does not remove viruses, bacteria or protozoa from water</li><li> Double-wall construction
  keeps water cool and reduces condensation on the outside of the bottle</li><li>
  Made of Eastman Tritan(TM) copolyester, the bottle is completely BPA-free and is
  dishwasher safe (do not put filter in the dishwasher)</li><li> Tritan copolyester
  provides excellent impact resistance and is suitable for both warm and cold beverages</li><li>
  Just bite the Big Bite(TM) valve and sip and the water starts flowing-you don't
  even need to tip the bottle to drink</li><li> Bite valve has an articulating stem,
  so when not in use it folds down next to the bottle and stays clean</li><li> Carry
  the integrated handle in the crook of a finger, or connect it to a pack or waistbelt
  with a small carabiner, sold separately</li></ul>
