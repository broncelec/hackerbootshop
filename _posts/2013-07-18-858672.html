description_list: '<h4>Responsive and smooth, the advanced-level Dalbello KR Two Core
  ski boots offer the precision to aggressively romp down the mountain with ease thanks
  to snug lasts and anatomic boot molds</h4><ul class="description"><li> 98mm footbeds
  provide a responsive, precision fit designed for discriminating feet, but thanks
  to a new boot mold, the boots don''t squeeze your feet like a vice</li><li> Boot
  mold enhances power, precision and comfort by matching 4 critical fit points: the
  heels, ankles, 5th metatarsals near your toes and the naviculars near insteps</li><li>
  Offering a precise foothold and a progressive forward flex, 3-piece shell optimizes
  responsiveness for today''s relatively short, wide skis</li><li> Separate cuff,
  shell and tongue sections are joined together to create a smooth forward flex with
  precise side-to-side support</li><li> Enhancing side-to-side response and providing
  a snugger wrap, bi-injected cuffs feature stiff plastic on sides and soft plastic
  on the straps that wrap around shins</li><li> Medium-flex tongues enhance responsiveness,
  control and sensitivity to skis and snow surface</li><li> Liners feature soft comfort
  foam around the rearfoot areas and tongues, and the toe boxes stretch to enhance
  comfort and fit</li><li> Liners are engineered to fit correctly right out of the
  box, but they can be custom formed as well, a procedure best performed in an REI
  specialty ski shop</li><li> Twin canting adjusts the cuffs to fit the angles of
  your lower legs, levels the soles of the boots above the skis and offers a versatile
  range of adjustment</li><li> Flex index of 110 offers the responsive power transfer
  preferred by advanced skiers</li></ul>'
