description_list: <h4>Serfas RX saddle for women is medically tested and proven to
  reduce cycling-related discomfort and numbness</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  A groove from tip to tail shifts rider's weight to inner thighs and buttocks, avoiding
  contact with the perineum, relieving pelvic discomfort</li><li> Also, the majority
  of rider weight is placed on the rear of the saddle, further reducing pressure against
  the perineal artery</li><li> Patented dual-density technology uses molded rubber
  inserts on base for shock absorption and an extra layer of Reactive Gel for added
  comfort</li><li> Hard frame provides excellent support and allows for increased
  ventilation</li><li> Compared to the men's RX saddle, the women's RX saddle design
  incorporates a wider back to accommodate wider pelvic bones and a slightly shorter
  nose</li></ul>
