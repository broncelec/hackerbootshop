description_list: <h4>The Rossignol Pursuit HP Titanium skis with bindings keep up
  with speeding turns on hardpack thanks to rock-solid stability and incredible edge
  grip</h4><ul class="description"><li> The Rossignol Pursuit HP Titanium skis with
  bindings really excel when you're sticking just to the groomers, and if you find
  yourself going off-piste, they won't disappoint</li><li> Wood core creates a light
  and lively ski with excellent ski-to-snow feel, and 2 titanium laminates above and
  below core provide powerful stiffness and lively response</li><li> An H-shaped split
  in the laminates at tip and tail ensures side-to-side response along entire length
  of skis</li><li> This H-shape also smooths out turn initiation and improves edge
  contact during turns</li><li> Rubber material damps vibrations and creates a smooth
  ride</li><li> Subtle rocker in tips offers easy steering in any snow condition,
  and traditional camber underfoot provides tenacious edge grip</li><li> Oversize
  tip tail dimensions and a large sidecute radius offer strong edging, power and precision</li><li>
  Performance-enhancing Axial^2 140 Ti Pro bindings use lateral arms to apply even
  edge pressure for energy-efficient power transfer</li><li> Dual Action III toe piece
  has reinforced housing in the high-stress areas, enhancing overall structural integrity</li><li>
  Reinforced housing strengthens the torsion bar interface, facilitating torsional
  rigidity in the toe piece</li><li> Dual Action III toe features multidirectional
  release</li><li> Axial^2 titanium heelpiece improves energy transfer to the ski
  so more power goes directly from the skier to the ski with less energy loss</li><li>
  High degree of forward pressure dramatically enhances the interface between boot
  and binding, improving rebound and responsiveness</li><li> DIN setting 4 - 14</li><li>
  Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
