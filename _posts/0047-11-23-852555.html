<h3>The 3-in-1 design of the REI Switchback gloves includes touch-screen compatible liner gloves and waterproof shells that can be worn together or separate to keep your hands warm in all weather</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Waterproof, breathable REI Elements(R) technology in the shells keeps hands dry while you backcountry ski, traverse glaciers and play in the snow</li>
<li> Removable fleece liner gloves keep hands warm in winter; wear just the liner gloves for jobs requiring greater dexterity</li>
<li> Liner gloves have material in the thumbs and forefingers that lets you control your touch-screen devices so you can send texts and surf the web without removing the gloves</li>
<li> Grippy palms on the shells handle ice tools and ski poles with ease</li>
<li> Soft fabric on the thumbs gives you a gentle place to wipe your nose</li>
<li> Wrist cinches and gauntlet closures are easy to operate with one hand</li>
<li> Removable leashes secure the REI Switchback gloves to your wrists</li>
</ul>
