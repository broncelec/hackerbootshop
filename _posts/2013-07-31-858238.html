description_list: <h4>Feel the rush of the newly designed Rossignol Soul 7 skis</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> Light like a pair of backcountry touring skis and responsive
  like big-mountain chargers, they dominate any terrain on the mountain</li><li> The
  Soul 7s are right at home lapping freshly fallen powder or blasting through crud,
  and they carve responsively on hardpack snow and groomed runs</li><li> Easy-to-turn
  honeycomb tip and tail are significantly lighter than previous models; you can actually
  see the light pass through the air-filled spaces in the honeycomb</li><li> You'll
  really appreciate the weight savings when the Soul 7s are strapped to your pack
  and you hike up the ridge to get first tracks</li><li> The responsive strength of
  the skis shines when dropping into steep terrain, negotiating a technical line,
  and straight-lining it back to the base</li><li> Float like a feather on top of
  deep snow thanks to the rockered tips and tails; redesigned Powder Turn rocker minimizes
  the tendency of tips to flap at high speeds</li><li> Standard camber underfoot offers
  tenacious edge-grip on hardpack; there's more than enough camber to enjoy carving
  on groomers</li><li> The Soul 7s feel extra smooth, especially at high speeds, thanks
  to the visco elastomer in the tip and tail that absorbs shock and resists chatter</li><li>
  The Rossignol Soul 7 skis require bindings with wide brakes</li><li> Base or topsheet
  color may vary from photo</li></ul>
