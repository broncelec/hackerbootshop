description_list: <h4>Packs down smaller than a banana in your pocket, the Klymit
  Inertia X-Lite 3/4 length sleeping pad features a unique cut out design making it
  one of the lightest and most compact sleeping pads</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Klymit uses body mapping to support the key areas, such as the head and hips, and
  removes padding in less critical areas to reduce weight</li><li> Cutouts preclude
  a sleeping bag's insulation from becoming compacted between your body and the sleeping
  pad, which allows the insulation to remain lofted for maximum warmth</li><li> Inertia
  X-Lite pad can be inflated with just 1 - 2 breaths; to adjust firmness, use the
  included hand pump to increase air pressure in pad</li><li> Use it under or inside
  (so you'll never fall off) your sleeping bag</li><li> Pad includes a stuff sack,
  patch kit and dry air pump</li><li> Folded up, pad can serve double duty as a backpanel/stay
  inside your frameless backpack</li><li> Constructed from 30-denier ripstop nylon
  top and a 75-denier polyester bottom for durability</li></ul>
