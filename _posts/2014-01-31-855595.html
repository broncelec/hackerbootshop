description_list: '<h4>Fast and easy to get in and out of, Time Xpresso 2 bike pedals
  offer a stable, secure and efficient platform at a great value</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Instead of metal springs, flexible carbon fiber blades tension the retention mechanisms,
  ensuring a secure pedal connection while reducing weight</li><li> Getting into the
  pedals is a breeze, thanks to the low-tension engagement of the retention mechanism:
  step in with little pressure, pedal engages cleat, and then pedal away! Excellent
  foot-to-pedal stability and solid power transfer is achieved through the oversize
  pedal platform and low stack height (distance from shoe sole to pedal axle)</li><li>
  Sturdy composite pedal bodies spin smoothly around steel axles</li><li> Foot/pedal
  interface can be tuned and optimized, offering adjustment to Q-factor (side-to-side),
  +/-5deg of angular float and 2</li><li>5mm of lateral float; 15deg release angle</li><li>
  Time Xpresso 2 bike pedals come with cleats and mounting hardware; compatible with
  most road cycling shoes with 3-hole mounts</li></ul>'
