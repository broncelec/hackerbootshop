description_list: '<h4>The Sierra Designs Flash 3 tent sets up in a matter of seconds
  with new ExoFusion technology</h4><ul class="description"><li> This setup combines
  an external pitch with an integrated fly to speed setup and increase interior space</li><li>
  ExoFusion shelters utilize an external frame combined with hybrid single and double
  wall panels; since there''s no separate fly to fuss with, the setup is easy and
  quick</li><li> Integration of the rainfly means the tent is protected during setup;
  the inner body of the tent won''t get soaked since there''s no separate rainfly
  to attach</li><li> Well-ventilated comfort: the exterior skeleton/hybrid wall construction
  allows effective vent placement and airflow planning that isn''t possible with traditional
  construction</li><li> Less material saves weight: exterior skeleton/hybrid wall
  construction also allows double walls where necessary and single walls otherwise</li><li>
  D-shape doors on the Sierra Designs Flash 3 tent provide roomy access; 2 vestibules
  provide separate storage areas</li><li> Light yet strong, DAC Featherlite(R) NSL
  poles are anodized without the use of harmful acids</li><li> Hub/pole design reduces
  the possibility of pitching errors and aids in the speed of the pitch</li><li> Jake''s

  out the floor</li><li> Taped rainfly seams and a seam-sealed floor offer weatherproof
  protection</li><li> Reflective door trim and guyouts aid nighttime visibility of
