<h3>The North Face Stow-N-Go II A/B High Impact sports bra provides the support you need for trail runs, gym classes and other active pursuits</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Quick-drying VaporWick(R) fabric seriously keeps up with hard-working pores, taking moisture from your skin and moving to the outside surface for quick evaporation</li>
<li> Double-layered panels of fabric offer additional modesty, and mesh panels placed over high heat areas enhance ventilation</li>
<li> Construction on interior of bra maximizes support and comfort</li>
<li> Internal pocket placed over sternum offers quick access to energy gels, keys or a debit card; moisture barrier in pocket protects contents</li>
<li> The North Face Stow-N-Go II A/B High Impact sports bra increases visibility in dim light thanks to its reflective logos</li>
</ul>
