<h3>Made for the untracked backcountry, the REI Double Diamond 50 snow pack has a place for everything you need to be safe, have fun and enjoy the powder</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Lightweight spring steel frame supports a gear-heavy outing, and it responds well to the movement of skiing and riding</li>
<li> Top lid pocket can hold snow-study tools and small items; outside of pocket features a bungee system for lashing on climbing skins or extra clothing</li>
<li> A-frame ski-carrying system accommodates wide skis and bulky bindings and carries a snowboard vertically; straps tuck away</li>
<li> Zippered back panel entry lets you access your gear and hydration reservoir (not included), even with your skis or board attached</li>
<li> Back panel material sheds snow and dries quickly</li>
<li> Hydration pocket is designed to accept most hydration reservoirs, reservoir not included</li>
<li> Insulated sleeve on shoulder strap stores the hydration hose to help prevent freeze-up and is large enough to accommodate right-angle shut-off valves</li>
<li> Flip back the top lid to access main compartment with room for safety essentials, food and extra layers</li>
<li> Inside the main compartment you'll find a clear accessory pocket and a tool sleeve for a probe or snow saw</li>
<li> Front pleated outside pocket is sized for a shovel and other avalanche gear, and it can be used as a stash pocket for climbing skins</li>
<li> Pocket offers enough room for a shovel blade, a shovel handle and a probe</li>
<li> Tarpaulin liner in pocket resists moisture and abrasion</li>
<li> Snow-resistant buckle closure is used on the front flap opening</li>
<li> Mesh sling zips out to carry your helmet on the trip up and tucks away when not in use; redesigned sling makes it easy to stash small items in nearby pocket</li>
<li> Hipbelt snugs comfortably to help distribute weight to your hips, not your back; hipbelt features a right-side pocket for easy access to small items</li>
<li> Hipbelt webbing system adjusts with a forward pull, creating a secure, ergonomic fit</li>
</ul>
