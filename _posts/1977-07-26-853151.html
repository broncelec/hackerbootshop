<h3>Rely on the Boone Woven shirt from The North Face to deliver moisture-wicking, quick-drying performance on the trail and comfort when you're hanging around the campsite</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Durable nylon/polyester blend protects against abrasion when you're bushwhacking or scrambling in the backcountry</li>
<li> Snap-down front makes it easy to put on and take off so you can regulate your temperature</li>
<li> On sunny days, flip the collar up to shade your neck from direct sunlight</li>
<li> Two low-profile chest pockets with rip-and-stick closures give you a place to stash cash, keys or a small compass</li>
</ul>
