<h3>With the sleek REI Side Country 19 snow pack, you can get away from the tracked-out runs and access the best parts of the mountain</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Perfect for a day at the resort, the REI Side Country 19 offers enough room for safety equipment, snacks and an extra layer</li>
<li> Tarpaulin interior resists moisture and abrasion</li>
<li> Front zippered pocket is sized for a shovel blade, and features a sleeve for the handle</li>
<li> Back panel material sheds snow and dries quickly</li>
<li> Skis carry diagonally across the front of the pack, and snowboards and snowshoes carry vertically down the center; straps tuck away</li>
<li> Padded front panel and tough reinforcement patches prevent damage from skis and snowboards</li>
<li> Clip on top of pack provides a place to attach your helmet and keep it out of the way while climbing</li>
<li> Hydration pocket is designed to accept most hydration reservoirs, reservoir not included</li>
<li> Insulated sleeve on shoulder strap stores the hydration hose to help prevent freeze-up and is large enough to accommodate right-angle shut-off valves</li>
<li> Hipbelt snugs comfortably to help distribute weight to your hips, not your back</li>
<li> Hipbelt webbing system adjusts with a forward pull, creating a secure, ergonomic fit</li>
<li> Snow-specific buckles are designed to work well with gloves on and to prevent clogging with snow</li>
</ul>
