<h3>These lightweight REI Oslo women's gloves feature a blend of polyester and wool for warmth</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> They can be worn as liners or on their own</li>
<li> Fabric absorbs body moisture through the natural wool fiber, then releases it into outer polyester fibers to accelerate drying</li>
<li> Lightweight, ergonomically constructed shape fits close to the skin; works well as liner gloves beneath shell gloves</li>
<li> REI Oslo gloves are specifically cut to fit women</li>
</ul>
