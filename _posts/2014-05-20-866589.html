description_list: <h4>With 27</h4><ul class="description"><li>5 in</li><li> wheels
  for quick acceleration and a shock-absorbent, 100mm-travel fork, the Scott Scale
  770 27</li><li>5 hardtail mountain bike is a solid performer on singletrack</li><li>

  benefits of large-diameter wheels-more speed and better traction</li><li> Compared
  to 26 in</li><li> wheels, larger-diameter wheels roll over obstacles more easily
  so you won't stall going uphill over roots and loose soil</li><li> Lightweight,
  butted aluminum frame is tuned to optimize efficiency in the climbs and remain responsive
  when descending</li><li> Suntour XCR RL suspension fork has 100mm of travel to smooth
  out trails; bar-top remote lockout lets you control suspension on the fly</li><li>
  Shimano Deore derailleurs and shifters offer consistent shifting across the 30 gears</li><li>
  Shimano hydraulic disc brakes provide easy, progressive braking no matter the conditions;
  180mm rotor up front and a 160mm rotor in the back</li><li> Sturdy wheels are wrapped
  with the excellent all-arounde Schwalbe Rocket Ron tires to ensure great traction
  and fast-rolling performance on the trail</li><li> Full-length cable housing deters
  gunky buildup that saps shifting performance; replaceable rear derailleur hanger
  helps extend the frame's usable lifespan</li><li> Specs on the Scott Scale 770 27</li><li>5
  hardtail mountain bike are subject to change</li></ul>
