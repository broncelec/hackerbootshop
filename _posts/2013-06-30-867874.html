description_list: <h4>A high-quality ABS kayak designed for small paddlers, the elegant
  Eddyline Fathom LV makes it easy to point your bow to the next destination and leave
  your worries on the shore</h4><ul class="description"><li> Smaller, lighter, and
  more nimble than its larger cousin, the Eddyline Fathom LV features enough initial
  stability to inspire confidence on multiday excursions</li><li> Combination of hard
  chines mid-ship and a healthy amount of rocker provide high secondary stability,
  making leaned, carved turns and more advanced techniques easy</li><li> Co-extruded
  ABS laminate creates a hull that offers the looks and performance of a composite
  kayak with the durability of plastic</li><li> Plastic is shaped into a 2-layer sheet
  with durable interior and an abrasion- and UV-resistant exterior, and then it's
  thermoformed using very high temperatures and a vacuum</li><li> 2-layer plastic
  laminate offers incredible stiffness and a hard, glossy appearance that resists
  abrasion and impact; plus, because it's plastic, it can also be easily repaired</li><li>
  Full-volume front deck offers enough room for paddlers, and the contoured thigh
  braces offer a secure fit for any size paddler</li><li> Sliding seat adjusts in
  relation to the thighbraces to enhance comfort</li><li> Low back deck makes it easy
  to execute a roll</li><li> Skeg is deployable in small increments to allow for fine-tuning
  in any condition in order to reduce weathercocking in crosswinds and increase tracking</li><li>
  The Eddyline Fathom LV kayak features bulkheads, a recessed compass holder, and
  3 day hatches with enough space to easily pack in overnight gear and then some</li></ul>
