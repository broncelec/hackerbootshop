description_list: '<h4>A light and tough carbon wheel that''s compatible with disc
  brakes, the Zipp 303 Firecrest Carbon Clincher front wheel delivers podium-level
  performance and weighs in at 780g</h4><ul class="description"><li> Ultralight carbon
  rim uses Firecrest(R) shaping to optimize the aerodynamic profile of both the front
  and back halves of the wheel</li><li> This rim shape also offers incredible crosswind
  stability, performing closer to a box-section rim despite the 45mm deep profile;
  dimpled surface dramatically reduces drag</li><li> Wider rim profile increases side-to-side
  stiffness for responsive sprinting and cornering; also offers great control, comfort,
  and strength</li><li> Zipp 188 hub uses Swiss-made cartridge bearings with extremely
  smooth-rolling grade 10 steel balls</li><li> Oversize 17mm diameter axle delivers
  significant stiffness for minimal deflection and precise response to input; axle
  spacing is 100mm</li><li> The Zipp 303 Firecrest Carbon Clincher Disc Front Wheel
  has a maximum tire pressure of 125 psi (8</li><li>62 bar)</li><li> Please note:

  tape, valve extender and Tangente butyl tube</li><li> Zipp recommends a maximum
  weight of 250 lbs</li><li> (113kg), including rider, bike and gear</li></ul>'
