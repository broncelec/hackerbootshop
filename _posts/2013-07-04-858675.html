description_list: '<h4>The women''s Dalbello KR Two Chakra ski boots are smooth-flexing
  divas ready for advanced skiing in any type of snow</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Their narrow footbeds and anatomic boot mold precisely dial you into the terrain</li><li>
  98mm lasts provide a responsive, precision fit designed for discriminating feet,
  but thanks to a new boot mold, the last doesn''t squeeze your feet like a vice</li><li>
  Boot mold enhances power, precision and comfort by matching 4 critical fit points:
  the heels, ankles, 5th metatarsals near your toes and the naviculars near insteps</li><li>
  Women''s fit is designed for your feet and calves, fabrics and insulation are selected
  for their softness and warmth and the structural materials are lighter and more
  flexible</li><li> Offering a precise foothold and a progressive forward flex, 3-piece
  shell optimizes responsiveness for today''s relatively short, wide skis</li><li>
  Separate cuff, shell and tongue sections are joined together to create a smooth
  forward flex with rigid lateral support</li><li> Highly resilient nylon tongues
  enhance responsiveness, control and sensitivity to skis and snow surface; they are
  flex-adjusted for female skiers</li><li> Lady fit liners are shaped specifically
  for women''s feet, with tapered heels, roomy forefeet, high insteps and low-profile
  cuffs</li><li> Lightweight, custom-formable liners also feature microfleece linings,
  performance insoles and a wrap design that optimizes control of rearfoot volume</li><li>
  Liners are engineered to fit correctly right out of the box, but they can be custom
  formed as well, a procedure best performed in an REI specialty ski shop</li><li>
  Twin canting adjusts the cuffs to fit the angles of your lower legs, levels the
  soles of the boots above the skis and offers a versatile range of adjustment</li><li>
  With a flex index of 95, Dalbello KR Two Chakra ski boots offer flex appropriate
  for advanced female skiers</li></ul>'
