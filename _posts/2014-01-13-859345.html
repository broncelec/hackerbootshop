description_list: <h4>With a special design that emphasizes a forgiving flex to help
  your kids learn, the K2 Indy skis with bindings inspire confidence and teach kids
  why we love this sport-because it's fun! Unlike traditional kids' skis which are
  thick and inflexible to ensure the retention of binding screws, these skis feature
  fused binding plates and a flex suited to youngsters</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Rockered tips and tails make learning to turn easy</li><li> Wide 70mm waist allows
  the skis to stay on top of crud and powder, so kids have more control in a variety
  of snow conditions</li><li> Torsion Box construction achieves a high degree of rebound
  and performance</li><li> Forgiving foam core helps absorb impacts and damp vibrations</li><li>
  Bindings feature a DIN range of 0</li><li>75 - 4</li><li>5, suited to young and
  lightweight skiers</li><li> Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
