<h3>The women's REI Recycled Fleece Grip gloves keep your hands warm while you walk the dog, take a hike or head to work in the morning</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Midweight fleece contains at least 50% recycled polyester fibers; fabric dries quickly and insulates even when damp</li>
<li> Textured synthetic leather palms offer sure grip</li>
<li> Stretch twill on the back of the wrists creates a comfortable fit that seals in warmth</li>
</ul>
