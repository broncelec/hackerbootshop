description_list: '<h4>The Continental Contact tire is a wonderful choice for all-around
  touring or commuting on city streets</h4><ul class="description"><li> Safety System
  puncture protection utilizes a polyamide nylon belt directly under the tread strip,
  making the tires virtually impervious to puncture and road debris</li><li> Rubber

  life while the silica boosts grip levels</li><li> Flexible shoulder lugs and fine
  sipes enhance grip in turns and on loose surfaces</li><li> Tire is grooved to channel
  water from center to side threads for improved traction on wet roads</li><li> Please
  note: although the tire sidewall may state "28 x 1 1/4 x 1 3/4" on it, please be
  assured that the tire will fit 700c rims</li></ul>'
