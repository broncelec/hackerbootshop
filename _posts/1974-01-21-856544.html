<h3>Cozy and vesratile, The North Face Reversible Moondoggy down jacket cuddles outdoor girls in downy warmth, and quickly alters its look from a classic solid to a fun plaid print</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Diamond-stitched nylon shell breathes well and securely holds the down insulation in place</li>
<li> 550-fill-power goose down insulation provides an unsurpassed warmth-to-weight ratio; down is the lightest, warmest and most compressible insulation available</li>
<li> Elasticized hood, cuffs and hem add protection from the elements</li>
<li> The North Face Reversible Moondoggy down jacket features zippered hand pockets on the solid side and welted hand pockets on the plaid side</li>
</ul>
