description_list: <h4>From soft, fresh morning snow to the icy turns at the end of
  the day, the Atomic Theory skis take on any terrain with 95mm waists for remarkable
  stability and nimble handling</h4><ul class="description"><li> 95mm waist and lightweight
  design floats and turns with ease in deep snow</li><li> Wood core provides smooth
  handling at high speeds and in deep powder snow</li><li> When skis are weighted,
  there is a slight rise in the tips that makes it easy to initiate turns</li><li>
  When skis are put on edge after starting a turn, the camber flattens out to deliver
  full contact with snow and excellent edge hold</li><li> Sidewall construction ensures
  maximum torsional rigidity, uncanny edge grip and controlled tip-to-tail flex; sidewall
  is reinforced in binding area with 3 layers of material</li><li> Half cap construction
  in tip and tail reduces swing weight and chipping when your skis bang together</li><li>
  Atomic Theory skis feature 95mm waists that require bindings with wide brakes</li><li>
  Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
