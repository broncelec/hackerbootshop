<h3>The REI Passage 2 tent features a classic dome shape and offers a great value</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> With its low weight and simple setup, this backpacking tent optimizes livability for 2 people</li>
<li> 2 side doors, each with their own vestibule, provide easy access without the need to crawl over your tentmate; dual storage space is a real plus</li>
<li> Fully adjustable, ceiling-level vents mitigate condensation by drawing cool air under the fly from the lower perimeter and exhausting warm, moist air</li>
<li> Rectangular floor plan with end-to-end symmetry makes it easy to arrange sleeping bags and gear and provides organizational efficiency and comfort</li>
<li> Equal-length aluminum poles, color coding and pole clips facilitate a quick and easy setup</li>
<li> Insider floor provides the waterproofness of a bathtub floor and the taut pitch of a cut-in floor; tautness improves door-zipper operation and maximizes volume at end walls</li>
<li> Seam-sealed polyester fly and floor ensure a waterproof, durable and sag-free shelter</li>
<li> Multiple interior storage options are provided by various combinations of mesh side pockets and hang loops located throughout the tent</li>
<li> Save weight and create a minimalist shelter by using just the rainfly, footprint (sold separately), poles and stakes</li>
<li> Includes a compression stuff sack, 6 stakes and 3 guylines with tighteners</li>
</ul>
