  new ThermoBall(TM) synthetic insulation to work</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Cozy and light, it mimics the best of down, yet still warms even when wet</li><li>
  Functioning like down feathers, the tiny round clusters of ThermoBall spun polyester
  trap warm air, while softly conforming to your body's shape</li><li> ThermoBall
  retains 80% of its insulating power even when dampened by rain, humidity or sweat,
  so you'll continue to stay warm</li><li> Small baffles in shell fabric allow insulation
  to fully expand to retain body heat; highly compressible ThermoBall insulation offers
  warmth equal to 600-fill-power goose down</li><li> Tightly-woven nylon shell features
  diamond stitching that helps hold insulation in place to keep it evenly distributed;
  Durable Water Repellent finish repels light moisture</li><li> Nylon lining wicks
  sweat off the skin for quick evaporation, helping you stay dry and comfortable</li><li>
  Quickly stuff the jacket into its own space-saving, left-hand stow pocket for compact
  storage</li><li> Zippered hand pockets; full-length front zipper with internal windflap;
  stretch-bound cuffs, low-profile drawcord hem</li><li> The North Face ThermoBall
  jacket has a standard fit and is machine washable</li><li> ThermoBall jackets were
  thoroughly tested by The North Face athletes, including Conrad Anker and Jimmy Chin,
  during summit trips on Denali and Mount Meru</li></ul>
