<h3>The beefy Dark Star -20degF synthetic bag from The North Face offers superior warmth in frigid, subzero conditions and high-altitude climbing expeditions</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Pertex(R) 20-denier nylon ripstop shell is lightweight and durable, and offers silky softness that enhances the insulation's loft</li>
<li> Pertex shell features a Durable Water Repellent finish that causes water to bead up and roll off</li>
<li> Climashield(R) a continuous filament insulation, provides warmth, durability and water resistance in a lightweight package</li>
<li> Overlapping shingle construction distributes insulation evenly and keeps it from moving around so there are no cold spots</li>
<li> Vaulted footbox allows natural foot movement and eliminates excess lateral space, increasing thermal efficiency to keep your feet warm and comfortable</li>
<li> The North Face Dark Star includes a compression stuff sack that doubles as a summit daypack</li>
</ul>
