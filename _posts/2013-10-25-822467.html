description_list: <h4>Designed to float in powder and carve up the corduroy, the Salomon
  BBR 8</h4><ul class="description"><li>9 skis bring an innovative new shape to the
  slopes</li><li> The Salomon BBR 8</li><li>9 skis work well if you're sticking to
  the groomed runs, but they are ideal if you find yourself switching between groomed
  runs and off-piste terrain</li><li> Full-wood core delivers direct transmission
  of power with precision and efficiency</li><li> Elastomer inserts placed over the
  front of the skis absorb vibrations, resulting in a smooth ride that softens ski-to-snow
  contact</li><li> Wide, surf-board inspired tips feature a very low profile rise
  that floats in powder and smooths out the ride in rough terrain</li><li> Tips are
  also shaped to reduce weight and minimize chatter when carving at high speeds</li><li>
  Relatively narrow waist offers a tight turning radius and enhances grip on firm
  snow</li><li> Narrowest part of waist is behind heels, allowing a versatile weight
  distribution on skis</li><li> Pintail releases out of turns easily and enhances
  control</li><li> Slightly raised tails let you ride backward and stick the occasional
  switch landing</li><li> Sandwich sidewall construction offers extremely smooth ski-to-snow
  contact and high adaptation to any terrain</li><li> Base or topsheet color may vary
  from online photo</li><li> Strong polyethylene fiber threaded between the edges
  of the skis increases edge strength to withstand big impacts</li></ul>
