description_list: <h4>The women's Dynafit Mercury TF randonee boots offer great walkability
  and lightness for the approach and excellent skiing performance for backcountry
  descents at mach speeds and landing big drops</h4><ul class="description"><li> Women-specific
  design features a lower profile than the men's version to better accommodate female
  leg shapes</li><li> Grilamid(R) shells and fiberglass-reinforced thermoplastic urethane
  and Pebax(R) cuffs provide stiffness for fast descents without being too heavy for
  backcountry tours</li><li> Comfortable, custom thermal-formable liners are premolded
  on anatomic lasts for use right out of the box; liner instep areas are low volume
  for responsive ski performance</li><li> Roomy toe areas in the liners allow good
  circulation so your toes stay warm; abrasion-resistant external fabric ensures the
  liners will stand up to regular use</li><li> Liners are not likely to require custom
  thermal-forming, but they can be molded to your feet by a qualified ski shop employee</li><li>
  Cuff and central buckle retention system prevents unwanted release; retention system
  maintains the desired tension so you don't have to make adjustments before skiing
  down</li><li> Rear spoilers slide inside the cuffs, allowing the widest and smoothest
  cuff rotation possible; spoilers alleviate friction between cuffs and liners</li><li>
  3mm-thick polyethylene layer in the shell provides adequate insulation to help keep
  your feet warm</li><li> The ski/walk mechanisms can be set between 15deg and 18deg
  of forward lean, as well as loosened for walking</li><li> Insert the included Downhill
  Booster tongues on the descent for added support, then remove them on the way back
  up for greater comfort and agility</li><li> Power straps help close the boots securely
  around your legs; straps can be removed from the rear cuffs and fixed to the Booster
  tongues to help you keep track of the tongues</li><li> Soles feature a mix of soft,
  medium and hard rubber compounds for excellent grip when hiking and compression
  resistance when skiing</li></ul>
