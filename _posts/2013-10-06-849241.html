description_list: <h4>Designed for ease-of-use, the Shimano Click'R PD-T400 bike pedals
  feature an easy-to-engage pedal/cleat interface for riders wanting to try clipless
  pedals for the first time</h4><ul class="description"><li> At the heart of the Click'R
  design is a light, easy-to-engage cleat spring that makes it quick and simple to
  clip in and clip out of the pedals</li><li> Reduced effort offers the efficiencies
  of a clipless system with little fuss-put a foot down fast for unexpected stops
  or step in casually when you're ready to roll</li><li> Plus, the amount of heel
  twist required to disengage is less than other clipless pedals, so you pop out of
  the pedals easier and sooner</li><li> Because of the easy-to-use design, these also
  work great for bike touring, commuting, leisure riding or any other riding where
  you make frequent stops</li><li> Pedals feature the convenience of dual-side entry;
  pop-up cages within the pedals grab cleats for fast, easy engagement</li><li> Spring
  tension can be adjusted to your preference</li><li> Integrated reflectors are built
  into the pedal body platforms for enhanced visibility</li><li> SPD cleats are included
  with the Shimano Click'R PD-T400 bike pedals; please note that the SPD cleats will
  only work with 2-hole SPD-compatible shoes</li></ul>
