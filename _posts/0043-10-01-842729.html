description_list: '<h4>The REI Lightweight Polartec(R) Power Dry(R) long-sleeve crew
  performs well as a baselayer underneath other insulating pieces or on its own in
  warmer weather</h4><ul class="description"><li> Polartec Power Dry utilizes 2 different
  yarns on either side of the fabric to enhance comfort: interior yarn wicks moisture,
  and exterior yarn dries quickly</li><li> The combination of the 2 yarns helps keep
  you dry during highly aerobic activities because it moves moisture away from skin
  faster than single-component fabrics such as cotton</li><li> Updated fabric protects
  skin against harmful ultraviolet light with a UPF rating of 20</li><li> Flatseam
  construction is soft and non-chafing next to skin; seams are designed to work under
  pack straps at shoulders</li><li> Underarm and side gussets promote freedom of motion</li><li>
  Dropped back hem stays tucked in</li><li> The REI Lightweight Polartec Power Dry
  long-sleeve crew features a next-to-skin fit that hugs the body and boosts fabric
  performance</li></ul>'
