description_list: ! '<h4>A warm, wicking base layer like the REI Midweight Polartec(R)
  Power Dry(R) Half Zip top can make the difference between cold-weather trips to
  remember and those to forget</h4><ul class="description"><li> Polartec Power Dry
  utilizes 2 different yarns on either side of the fabric to enhance comfort: interior
  yarn wicks moisture, and exterior yarn dries quickly</li><li> Combination of the
  2 yarns helps keep you dry during highly aerobic activities because it moves moisture
  away from skin faster than single-component fabrics such as cotton</li><li> Fabric
  offers UPF rating of 20 to protect against harmful UV light</li><li> Center front
  zipper allows ventilation control</li><li> Flatseam construction is soft and non-chafing
  next to skin, and raglan seams are designed to be comfortable when wearing pack
  straps on your shoulders</li><li> Underarm and side gussets promote freedom of motion
  and reduce chafing under a hipbelt</li><li> Longer length helps top stay tucked
  in, and smooth texture of outer surface helps it slide easily under extra layers</li><li>
  The men''s REI Midweight Polartec Power Dry Half Zip top features a next-to-skin
  fit that hugs the body</li></ul>'
