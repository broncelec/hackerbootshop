<h3>With a twist of the 3-in-1 design, the Starks Triclimate jacket by The North Face mates an insulated vest over an insulated, waterproof jacket for street-savvy style and all-things-winter versatility</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Three different ways to wear the system: wear shell jacket and vest together for maximum protection or wear either piece on its own as weather warrants</li>
<li> HyVent(TM) 2-layer construction of jacket is waterproof, windproof and breathable; fully sealed seams prevent moisture from seeping through</li>
<li> Jacket is lightly insulated with Heatseeker(TM) polyester fiber insulation to supply stand-alone warmth when wearing the jacket on its own</li>
<li> Powder skirt with gripping elastic keeps snow out; snaps let you integrate the powder skirt with compatible pants by The North Face (sold separately)</li>
<li> Zip handwarmer pockets; wrist pocket with goggles cloth; internal media pocket; internal goggles pocket</li>
<li> Cinch adjustable hem and rip-and-stick wrist cuffs help seal out cold air and retain valuable warmth; zip underarm vents let you control airflow and your comfort</li>
<li> Fully adjustable hood ensures a weather-blocking, personalized fit</li>
<li> The North Face Starks Triclimate vest uses 550-fill-power goose down throughout the main vest body and Heatseeker polyester fiber insulation at sides to keep you warm</li>
<li> Vest has zippered handwarmer pockets for convenience when wearing best on its own or over the jacket</li>
</ul>
