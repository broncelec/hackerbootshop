<h3>Cool drizzle on the horizon? The North Face Apex Lite jacket for women shelters you from chilling moisture while you train</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Front of jacket and upper arms use a specialized polyester fabric that works to block wind from chilling your core and sapping energy</li>
<li> Permanently embedded active microporous particles increase the surface area of the fibers in the polyester fabric, thus speeding evaporative cooling and drying</li>
<li> Side panels, back panels and arm panels use a polyester and elastane fabric to encourage high levels of breathability, moisture-management and ease of movement</li>
<li> Durable Water Repellent finish causes water to bead up and roll off, fending off light rain showers and snow</li>
<li> Chest pocket with cord exit port works with a media player</li>
<li> Articulated cuffs fold out over hands for warmth</li>
<li> Ventilation areas of the jacket align with high-heat areas of the body to help keep you dry and comfortable</li>
<li> The women's The North Face Apex Lite jacket features reflective hits to increase visibility in low light</li>
</ul>
