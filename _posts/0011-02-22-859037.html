<h3>The REI Heavyweight Polartec(R) Power Dry(R) Crew shirt offers proven value in a substantial base layer for all your hiking, mountaineering or snow-sports adventures</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Polartec Power Dry uses two different yarns on either side of the fabric to enhance comfort; interior yarn wicks moisture and exterior yarn dries quickly</li>
<li> Combination of the two yarns helps keep you dry during highly aerobic activities because it moves moisture away from skin and dries more quickly than single-component fabrics</li>
<li> Soft, flat seams help eliminate chafing; seams at the shoulders are strategically positioned to work with pack straps; underarm and side gussets promote freedom of motion</li>
<li> Next-to-skin fit hugs the body, maintaining skin contact to boost fabric performance</li>
<li> Longer length helps the REI Heavyweight Polartec Power Dry Crew shirt stay tucked in; smooth texture of outer surface makes it easy to slide on additional layers</li>
<li> Fabric offers a UPF rating of 50+ to protect against harmful UV light</li>
<li> Closeout</li>
</ul>
