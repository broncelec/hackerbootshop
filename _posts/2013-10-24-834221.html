description_list: <h4>While the Switch Lycan sunglasses may not grant you the superhuman
  senses of the werewolf, they will bestow the boons of glare-reducing polarized lenses
  and a speedy magnetic lens interchange system</h4><ul class="description"><li> Polarized
  lenses reduce 99% of visible glare from water, snow, sand and pavement for increased
  visual acuity and decreased eye strain</li><li> Switch interchangeable system uses
  high-energy embedded magnets, so lenses jump into place when brought near the frames</li><li>
  Magnets are engineered to stay in place when subjected to the intense jarring of
  skiing, snowboarding, running or mountain biking</li><li> Superior grade nylon frames
  offer a consistent fit and flexibility in all temperatures and are extremely impact
  resistant</li><li> Frames include 2 sets of lenses-1 set of polarized lenses for
  bright light and 1 set of non-polarized, rose-tinted lenses for low light</li><li>
  All frames come with gray polarized lenses, which provide true color definition
  on bright, sunny days; lens mirror coatings vary between frames</li><li> Lightweight
  and virtually shatterproof, polycarbonate lenses are 20 times more impact resistant
  than glass and one-third the weight</li><li> TriGuard(TM) thin-film lens coating
  is easy to clean, withstands rough handling and causes water to bead up and run
  off</li><li> Magnetic LensPod(TM) keeps your lenses protected in an easy-to-carry,

  cleaning pouch</li><li> Medium to large fit</li></ul>
