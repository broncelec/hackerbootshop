<h3>To commute, shop or trek to the museum in wet, winter weather, wrap your body in the long, down-filled Miss Metro parka from The North Face</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Even the hood is insulated for those really blustery days</li>
<li> High-quality, water-resistant 600-fill-power down is warm, lightweight and compressible</li>
<li> Water-resistant down is treated to stay drier longer and dry faster than untreated down</li>
<li> Nylon satin lining slides on easily over layers</li>
<li> Insulated, adjustable hood removes when not needed</li>
<li> Two-way center-front zipper eases sitting; snap placket keeps out drafts; chin guard protects neck</li>
<li> The North Face Miss Metro down parka features an internal media pocket and zippered hand pockets</li>
<li> Metal logo rivet at left bicep; embroidered logo on back right shoulder</li>
</ul>
