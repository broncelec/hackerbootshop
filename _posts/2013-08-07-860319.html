description_list: <h4>Frontside speed on groomers or backside face shots in untracked
  powder? The Volkl Kendo skis let you explore the best of both sides of the mountain
  thanks to 89mm waists and tough construction</h4><ul class="description"><li> Kendo
  skis are quick and responsive across all terrain and in all conditions, and 89mm
  waists offer enough flotation to enjoy the occasional powder stash</li><li> With
  a vertically laminated poplar and beech core and vertical sidewalls, these skis
  turn easily from edge to edge and are responsive to aggressive turns at high speed</li><li>
  You'll appreciate the smooth, powerful snap of these skis thanks to 2 full-length
  titanium laminates that absorb vibration and increase the feel of the terrain</li><li>
  Slight rise in the tips makes it easy to turn in pow and offers stability in crud
  and wind-blown, manky snow; standard camber underfoot makes it easy to shred groomers</li><li>
  Low tip reduces chatter on groomed runs and resists diving in soft snow</li><li>
  Directional twin tip heavily favors skiing forward but allows you to ski and land
  jumps backward if needed</li><li> Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
