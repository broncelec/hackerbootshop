description_list: <h4>With a woman-specific fit, comfortable straps and lightweight
  construction, the Union Legacy snowboard bindings ensure all-day comfort, all winter
  long</h4><ul class="description"><li> Union bindings are designed to promote a free,
  even board flex for sweet response, board control and improved board durability</li><li>
  Female-specific Stage III Atlas bases are made with high-quality DuPont(TM) Zytel(R)
  ST nylon which is lightweight yet durable</li><li> Union baseplates are designed
  to provide supreme strength with the smallest footprint possible to reduce interference
  with your board's true flex</li><li> Injected EVA bushings damp vibrations underfoot
  to promote a comfortable ride and smooth, even board flex with no dead spots</li><li>
  Extruded aluminum heel cups undergo an anodizing process that further increases
  their strength by 30%; they'll maintain their shape no matter how much wear and
  tear they see</li><li> Asymmetric highbacks build in flex and tweakability where
  you want it, and support and durability where you need it; tool-less forward lean
  adjustments</li><li> 3D Direct-Connect ankle straps eliminate elasticity and evenly
  distribute pressure across feet and ankles for increased comfort and board control</li><li>
  Multi-position toe straps fit a wide range of boots; magnesium buckles are 4 times
  stronger than aluminum with only half the weight</li><li> Union Legacy bindings
  are compatible with Burton The Channel M6 snowboards</li></ul>
