description_list: <h4>Ready for heavy snowfall, switch landings and freestyle tricks,
  the women's K2 Remedy 117 skis feature rockered twin tips to help you make the most
  of epic powder days</h4><ul class="description"><li> 117mm waists and rockered tips
  designed for powder offer unparalleled performance in deep snow, and camber underfoot
  offers edge grip on the way back to the lifts</li><li> Slightly lower rockered tails
  offer a large landing platform, ideal for hucking cliffs and jumps</li><li> K2 women's
  skis reduce the bulk and weight of all components to create very lightweight skis
  suited to the specific needs of female skiers</li><li> The stiffest core in K2's
  women's skis, Bioflex3 core combines aspen, paulownia and bamboo woods to deliver
  instant response and high durability</li><li> A fiberglass weave around the wood
  core provides torsional stiffness for highly responsive turning</li><li> Directional
  twin tip heavily favors skiing forward but allows you to ski and land jumps backward
  if desired</li><li> The widest point of the tips is placed further back than on
  other K2 skis to reduce the tendency of skis to hook in light crust and throw you
  off balance</li><li> Use tip and tail holes to attach skins (sold separately); remove
  plugs with a flathead screwdriver</li><li> 117mm waist requires bindings with wide
  brakes</li><li> Base or topsheet color of the women's K2 Remedy 117 skis may vary
  from online photo</li></ul>
