description_list: <h4>Built for aggressive descents, the Volkl Gotama skis surf the
  powder, bust through crud and take an edge on groomers without hesitation thanks
  to a fully rockered design</h4><ul class="description"><li> Full rocker increases
  maneuverability in deep snow, making turns in powder effortless and adding a surflike,
  floaty feel</li><li> The smooth, gradual rocker from tip to tail also creates uninterrupted
  edge contact on groomed runs, ripping graceful arcs in corduroy on your way back
  to the lifts</li><li> Low tip reduces chatter on groomed runs and resists diving
  in soft snow</li><li> Multilayer wooden core uses dense ash under the bindings to
  ensure screws won't come loose during harsh landings</li><li> Soft poplar in the
  remainder of the skis makes them snappy and responsive</li><li> Tough Box construction
  sheathes the wood core in composite and fiberglass to remain durable during high
  speed landings and to snap back quickly from aggressive turns</li><li> Carbon laminate
  in the bottom layer of the core stabilizes the ride and further enhances durability</li><li>
  Stiff flex zone in front adds stability, and medium flex underfoot transitions to
  the soft tail that aids in turning on groomers and maneuvering in pow</li><li> Directional
  twin tip heavily favors skiing forward but allows you to ski and land jumps backward
  if needed</li><li> Volkl Gotama skis with 107mm waists require bindings with wide
  brakes</li><li> Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
