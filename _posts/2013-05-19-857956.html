description_list: <h4>The all-new Jones Aviator snowboard is made for the daredevil
  park rider inside of you</h4><ul class="description"><li> Built for going big, this
  board features 3D beveled up edges for a looser, less-catchy feel in the park</li><li>
  Edges are beveled from the contact points of the camber to the ends of the board,
  releasing the edges where they are most likely to catch</li><li> Twin profile and
  blunt nose keep you floating while the mellow Magne-Traction locks in stability
  when the fresh tracks are gone; camber profile offers insane edge response</li><li>
  Mellow Magne-Traction improves edge grip by adding five contact points along the
  running length of the board, resulting in amazing control whether riding ice or
  pow</li><li> Full wood core is comfortable and robust; it's a true all-terrain core
  and certified by the Forest Stewardship Council; fiberglass enhances the flex and
  board feel</li><li> Carbon stringers improve pop and torsional stiffness, and increase
  the longevity of the flex profile</li><li> Film topsheet saves weight over traditional
  plastic topsheets; sintered base absorbs and retains wax; steel edges</li><li> P-tex
  waste is drastically reduced by flip-flopping base graphic colors between boards;
  base colors are random, thus specific requests cannot be accommodated</li><li> </li></ul>
