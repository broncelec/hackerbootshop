description_list: <h4>The K2 Annex 108 skis use a metal laminate and rockered tips
  to amp up your sidecountry explorations, from blazingly fast lines in fresh powder
  to wind-blown crust and sun-baked bowls</h4><ul class="description"><li> Dual titanal
  laminate offers unwavering stability at high speeds by absorbing bumps and responding
  quickly to high-speed maneuvers</li><li> Rockered tips initiate turns easily and
  offer agile performance on all kinds of terrain, and slight camber underfoot offers
  tenacious edge hold on firm snow</li><li> Lightweight aspen, paulownia and maple
  wood core produces a natural flex, allowing the ski to achieve full contact with
  the snow throughout the turn</li><li> The widest point of the tips is placed further
  back than on other K2 skis to reduce the tendency of skis to hook in light crust
  and throw you off balance</li><li> Slightly raised tails release easily during turns
  to reduce speed and avoid obstacles, and they make it easier to turn quickly when
  skiing concave-shaped couloirs and chutes</li><li> Use tip and tail holes to attach
  skins (sold separately); remove plugs with a flathead screwdriver</li><li> 108mm
  waist requires bindings with wide brakes</li><li> Base or topsheet color of the
  K2 Annex 108 skis may vary from online photo</li></ul>
