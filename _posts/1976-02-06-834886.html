<h3>The all-purpose, cold-weather Nuptse mittens from The North Face feature 600-fill-power down insulation to keep hands warm during winter camping trips and alpine explorations</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Water-resistant ripstop nylon exteriors and leather palms shed moisture and breathe well; brushed tricot lining feels soft against skin</li>
<li> High-quality 600-fill-power goose down is warm, lightweight and compressible</li>
<li> 5 Dimensional Fit(TM) uses 5 measurements of the hand to construct gloves with an accurate and consistent fit</li>
<li> FlashDry(TM) fabric additive in liners dramatically improves drying time and breathability without adding weight or bulk or washing out</li>
<li> Made of crushed coconut shells and crushed volcanic rock, FlashDry moves moisture from 1 layer to another to keep you dry</li>
<li> Soft fabric on back of thumbs is great for wiping nose drips</li>
<li> Full-length, over-the-cuff gauntlets feature shockcords with cordlocks to seal out cold air</li>
<li> Nuptse mittens feature reinforced leather palms and tips for exceptional durability</li>
</ul>
