description_list: <h4>Use the CamelBak Groove(TM) Filter bottle to turn your potable
  tap water into great-tasting water that you can enjoy while at home, in the office
  or on the go</h4><ul class="description"><li> Simply fill the bottle with tap water,
  screw the cap on and start sipping; the integrated plant-based carbon filter reduces
  chlorine taste and odors found in tap water</li><li> Filter is good for up to 3
  mos</li><li> and is an easy way to enjoy tap water rather than purchasing disposable
  bottles of water</li><li> CamelBak Groove Filter bottle should be used to improve
  the taste of safe water sources only; filter does not remove viruses, bacteria or
  protozoa from water</li><li> Made of Eastman Tritan(TM) copolyester, the bottle
  is completely BPA-free and is dishwasher safe (do not put filter in the dishwasher)</li><li>
  Tritan copolyester provides excellent impact resistance and is suitable for both
  warm and cold beverages</li><li> Bypass the potential hazards of drinking from wide
  openings-the CamelBak Groove bite valve virtually eliminates spills</li><li> Just
  bite and sip and the beverage flows through the valve-you don't even need to tip
  the bottle to drink</li><li> Bite valve has an articulating stem, so when not in
  use it folds down next to the bottle and stays clean</li><li> Carry the integrated
  handle in the crook of a finger, or connect it to a pack or waistbelt with a small
  carabiner, not included</li></ul>
