description_list: <h4>SRAM X0 10-speed grip shifters deliver simple, fast shifts with
  a flick of a wrist, all with a low-profile, lightweight and tough design that'll
  be at home on any trail</h4><ul class="description"><li> All-metal indexing delivers
  precise shifts with positive feel; shifter rotates on 3 rows of ball bearings for
  smooth action with minimal effort as well as excellent longevity</li><li> Twist
  design enables the full range of up/down shifts so you can jump a bunch of gears
  in one go (instead of one-at-a-time with trigger setups)</li><li> Also, the design
  provides a low-profile look with plenty of clearance for brake and/or handlebar
  remote levers</li><li> Exact Actuation design takes the 1:1 actuation ratio of cable
  travel/derailleur movement and optimizes it for easy, dependable setup and 10-speed
  application</li><li> Includes an integrated lock-on grip system, which can be converted
  to work with other lock-on grips</li><li> Choose between either 2x or 3x 10-speed
  drivetrains; compatible with all SRAM 2x or 3x 10-speed Exact Actuation derailleurs</li><li>
  The X0 10-Speed Grip Shifters are sold as a set (front and rear shifters) and come
  with cables and housing</li></ul>
