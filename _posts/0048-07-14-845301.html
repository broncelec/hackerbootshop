<h3>Sleep well on car-camping adventures with the warm and comfortable REI InCamp Insulated air pad</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Horizontal baffles are insulated with high-loft, lightweight PrimaLoft(R) Infinity insulation for great warmth on cold nights</li>
<li> Integrated pump lets you inflate the pad by hand rather than by mouth; 2 flat valves won't get in the way, and they allow for quick inflation and deflation</li>
<li> Pad can be easily and quickly connected to another REI InCamp Insulated air pad via the 3 low-profile buckles on the side</li>
<li> Brushed polyester surface has a soft hand and resists slipping; 75-denier polyester bottom resists wear and tear</li>
<li> Fully welded construction is leakproof</li>
<li> The REI InCamp Insulated air pad comes with a stuff sack to keep the pad protected and stowed compactly when you're on the trail</li>
</ul>
