description_list: '<h4>A 900g carbon wheel built for speed, the rear Zipp 303 Firecrest
  Carbon Clincher Disc Wheel offers 11-speed compatibility and a versatile clincher
  design that works with disc brakes</h4><ul class="description"><li> Ultralight carbon
  rim uses Firecrest(R) shaping to optimize the aerodynamic profile of both the front
  and back halves of the wheel</li><li> This rim shape also offers incredible crosswind
  stability, performing closer to a box-section rim despite the 45mm deep profile;
  dimpled surface dramatically reduces drag</li><li> Wider rim profile increases side-to-side
  stiffness for responsive sprinting and cornering; also offers great control, comfort,
  and strength</li><li> Zipp 188 hub uses Swiss-made cartridge bearings with extremely
  smooth-rolling grade 10 steel balls</li><li> Shimano/SRAM freehub body is compatible
  with 11-speed cassettes; works with 10-speed cassettes with optional shim (shim
  not included)</li><li> 24 spokes are laced radially on the drive-side and crossed
  on the non-drive-side onto the 188 hub</li><li> Oversize 17mm diameter axle delivers
  significant stiffness for minimal deflection and precise response to input; axle
  spacing is 135mm</li><li> The rear Zipp 303 Firecrest Carbon Clincher Disc Wheel
  has a maximum tire pressure of 125 psi (8</li><li>62 bar)</li><li> Please note:
  this wheel is clincher-compatible only and comes with a quick-release skewer, rim
  tape, valve extender and Tangente butyl tube</li><li> Zipp recommends a maximum
  weight of 250 lbs</li><li> (113kg) including rider, bike and gear</li></ul>'
