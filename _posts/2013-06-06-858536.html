description_list: <h4>The Burton Custom Flying V snowboard is the all-mountain board
  you've come to know and love</h4><ul class="description"><li> It blends rocker and
  camber, giving you the best of both worlds when riding both steeps and park features</li><li>
  Rocker between and outside the feet enhances playfulness and float in pow; subtle
  camber zones underneath your feet combine with edge-gripping tech to add pop, snap
  and power</li><li> Burton Channel system offers unlimited, on-the-fly stance adjustability
  and is compatible with traditional Burton 3D(R) bindings</li><li> The Channel lets
  you fine-tune your stance width to the millimeter, and then dial in your toe-to-heel
  centering and rotate your angles in one fell swoop</li><li> Wood core is snappy,
  strong and responsive; wood grain positioned along toe and heel edges is perpendicular
  to the core for superior edge hold and strength</li><li> Fiberglass energy strands
  radiate outward from the Channels to the board's edges, providing poppiness and
  responsiveness without stiffening the board</li><li> Lightweight Carbon aligned
  with the board's spine adds to board's longitudinal snap</li><li> Squeezbox tech
  transfers energy outward from under your feet, energizing the tip and tail for added
  snap when exiting a turn and ollieing</li><li> Additionally, Squeezbox creates a
  more stable board that can be powered up and manipulated with less effort</li><li>
  Edges extend out about half a millimeter underneath bindings for tremendous edge
  hold in hard, icy conditions, and are tuned to slice and dice the entire mountain</li><li>
  Pro-Tip(TM) edges are tapered at the tip and tail, reducing swing weight and improving
  powder flotation</li><li> Highly-porous sintered base is ultra durable and has specially
  formulated wax infused into the pores for long-lasting glide</li><li> </li></ul>
