description_list: <h4>A playful, wide-waisted twin tip for advanced skiers on any
  terrain, the Blizzard Peacemaker skis use naturally rockered tips to resist chatter
  on groomers, float high in pow and bust up crud</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Blizzard builds the rocker without bending the core, creating a naturally flexing,
  responsive ski that turns easily, resists high-speed chatter and shreds crud and
  pow</li><li> Light camber underfoot assists with grip on hardpack</li><li> Not as
  stiff as metal-reinforced skis, the Peacemaker skis use a fiberglass layup to lend
  a playful feel for smearing pillow lines and skidding around in pow</li><li> Wood
  core is constructed like a sandwich with layers of precisely-milled strips reinforcing
  each other to create a lightweight, snappy ski with smooth and easy handling</li><li>
  Sidewalls direct power right to the edges of the skis, resulting in quick side-to-side
  response</li><li> True twin profile provides equal responsiveness whether you're
  skiing forward or backward</li><li> 104mm waists require bindings with wide brakes</li></ul>
