description_list: <h4>Ready to charge the steepest powder-covered slopes with stable,
  reinforced rockered tips and tails, the Atomic Automatic skis sit at the pinnacle
  of the brand's freeski powder category</h4><ul class="description"><li> Wood core
  provides smooth handling at high speeds and in deep powder; titanium reinforcements
  in tips and tails increase stability and reduce chatter on hard snow</li><li> Early
  rise in the tips and tails enhances powder skiing forward or switch; traditional
  camber underfoot enhances edge grip on firm snow</li><li> The Automatic skis prefer
  skiing forward thanks to a long cambered section underfoot with mellow tail rocker,
  but they will allow skiing backwards if you desire</li><li> Sidewall construction
  ensures maximum torsional rigidity, uncanny edge grip and controlled tip-to-tail
  flex; sidewalls are reinforced in binding areas with 3 layers</li><li> Half cap
  construction in tips and tails reduces swing weight and chipping when your skis
  bang together</li><li> Directional twin-tip design offers increased performance
  in varied snow conditions and during backcountry freestyle maneuvers</li><li> Atomic
  Automatic skis feature 117mm waists that require bindings with wide brakes</li><li>
  Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
