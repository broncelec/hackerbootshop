description_list: <h4>With a whale of a mouth and removable backpack straps, the rugged,
  weather-resistant Thule Chasm Duffel in medium is your go-to gear hauler for any
  adventure</h4><ul class="description"><li> Zippered top of the oversize mouth opens
  from one side, like a book, which makes it easy to access gear in the main compartment
  from just about any angle</li><li> Padded shoulder straps attach to quickly convert
  the duffel to a backpack; duffel straps snap down cleanly along the side of the
  duffel so they don't flap around</li><li> Exterior compression straps keep gear
  inside duffel from falling to the lower end when carried in vertical backpack mode</li><li>
  Interior zippered mesh pockets and an exterior zippered pocket organize smaller
  stuff</li><li> Padded bottom cushions your gear; locking zippers deter thieves (lock
  sold separately)</li><li> Durable, waterproof tarpaulin fabric stands up on its
  own for easy packing, yet easily folds for storage</li><li> Thule Chasm Duffel in
  medium holds 70 liters of gear, enough for an adventure lasting a weekend or a week</li></ul>
