description_list: <h4>With powder-seeking, 114mm waists and naturally rockered tips
  and tails, the Blizzard Gunsmoke skis offer advanced skiers a lightweight, playful
  ride in the deep stuff</h4><ul class="description"><li> Not as stiff as metal-reinforced
  skis, the Gunsmoke skis use a fiberglass layup to create a softer flex for smearing
  pillow lines and skidding around in pow</li><li> Blizzard builds the rocker without
  bending the core, creating a naturally flexing, responsive ski that turns easily,
  resists high-speed chatter and shreds crud and pow</li><li> Light camber underfoot
  assists with grip on hardpack</li><li> Wood core is constructed like a sandwich
  with layers of precisely-milled strips reinforcing each other to create a lightweight,
  snappy ski with smooth and easy handling</li><li> True twin profile provides equal
  responsiveness whether you're skiing forward or backward</li><li> Sidewalls direct
  power right to the edges of the skis, resulting in quick side-to-side response</li><li>
  114mm waists require bindings with wide brakes</li></ul>
