<h3>The North Face Snow Leopard sleeping bag offers the optimal balance of weight and warmth for cold-weather backpacking and mountaineering</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Solid layer of Climashield Apex insulation is placed over the core of body to reflect radiant heat back to you; synthetic insulation is a small-diameter, continuous-filiment</li>
<li> Wrapping all around is Climashield(TM) Prism synthetic insulation, a high-lofting, warm and light insulation that even works exceptionally well when compressed</li>
<li> Overlapping shingle construction prevents insulation from moving around, creating consistent warmth</li>
<li> Top shell features extremely lightweight nylon fabric; nylon bottom shell defends against grit/abrasion</li>
<li> Adjustable insulated draft collar with microfleece cord tunnel is comfortable against skin</li>
<li> Oversize top draft tube backing snag-free zipper prevents heat loss</li>
<li> Internal draft tube pocket stores small items to keep them warm (headlamp batteries) and within easy reach</li>
<li> Color-coded, 1-handed hood drawcords and glow-in-the-dark zipper pulls make adjustments easy at night</li>
<li> Features a roomy, vaulted footbox that has a tricot lining for added warmth and comfort</li>
<li> Includes lightweight compression stuff sack</li>
</ul>
