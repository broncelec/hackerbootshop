description_list: <h4>Keep the cold weather at bay and your engine warm with the Kelty
  Ignite DriDown(TM) 16degF sleeping bag that stays warm and dry with revolutionary
  down insulation</h4><ul class="description"><li> Regular down takes on water and
  is very difficult to dry; the DriDown proprietary process treats each individual
  duck down plume with a hydrophobic finish</li><li> With the down now resistant to
  water, the insulation maintains its loft and stays dry 7 times longer than untreated
  down</li><li> It also performs better in high humidity than regular down, and in
  case it accidentally gets wet, it will dry out faster, too</li><li> Baffle construction
  with differential cut eliminates cold spots; inner layer is cut smaller than the
  outer layer to create consistent thickness of insulation</li><li> Tough, 30-denier
  ripstop nylon shell provides durabilty; polyester lining breathes for comfort and
  feels great against skin</li><li> Top baffle draft collar drapes comfortably over
  neck and shoulders, sealing out drafts</li><li> Formfitting hood has drawcords of
  differing widths at head and neck for easy identification and adjustment in the
  dark</li><li> Ground-level side seam keeps draft tube in place, further helping
  to prevent cold air from seeping through the 2-way, locking zipper</li><li> Internal
  loops provide attachment for a liner (sold separately) to increase the warmth of
  the bag</li><li> Pad loops provide attachment points to keep your sleeping bag and
  pad together, so you needn't worry about rolling onto the cold, hard ground (straps
  sold separately)</li><li> Hang loops allow easy drying and storage</li><li> Kelty
  Ignite DriDown 16degF sleeping bag comes with a stuff sack</li></ul>
