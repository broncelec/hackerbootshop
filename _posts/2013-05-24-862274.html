  construction and aggressive rubber tread for performance on all trails, especially
  the muddy ones</h4><ul class="description"><li> Thick rubber treads provide reliable
  traction when you''re off the bike, but shed the mud when you''re back on the pedals</li><li>
  Synthetic leather and nylon mesh uppers are breathable and durable; low-cut ankles
  reduce overall weight</li><li> 3 rip-and-stick closure straps are angled 15deg from
  traditional strap placement to follow a more anatomic curve, easing instep pressure
  and ensuring a secure fit</li><li> EVA footbeds provide comfortable cushioning and
  lasting arch support</li><li> Stiff nylon and composite fiber plate ensures efficient
  power transfer; Direct-Vent system enhaces breathability on warm days and drainage
  on wet ones</li><li> Low profile, concave shape of footbed and plate cradles the
  foot for support, comfort and pedaling efficiency</li><li> Pearl Izumi SELECT mountain
  bike shoes are compatible with SPD, Time, Look, Speedplay and Crank Brothers cleats</li><li>
