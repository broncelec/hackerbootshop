<h3>The women's North Face Ventana Quarter-Zip is perfect for cool-weather activities</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> It's made from quick-drying, moisture-wicking fabric with FlashDry(TM) fibers to optimize temperature regulation</li>
<li> Made of crushed coconut shells and crushed volcanic rock, FlashDry fibers dramatically improve the fabric's dry time and breathability and won't wash out</li>
<li> Natural particles in FlashDry fabric resist odors</li>
<li> Polyester/elastane fabric blend has a comfortable amount of stretch to move with you when you're active</li>
<li> Strategically placed knit panels on the neck, down the upper back and under the arms allow good breathability to air out the places where you sweat the most</li>
<li> Thumbholes and flatlock seams enhance your comfort when wearing The North Face Ventana Quarter-Zip top</li>
</ul>
