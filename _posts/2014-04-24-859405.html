description_list: <h4>With an intermediate skill level DIN range of 3 - 10 and a design
  that releases in four separate directions, the Look PX 10 Wide downhill ski bindings
  enhance protection from unexpected falls</h4><ul class="description"><li> Toepieces
  provide multidirectional release for optimum protection in all types of falls; 4
  contact points between the toepieces and the boots ensure effective power transfer</li><li>
  PX 10 wide bindings feature 45mm of elastic travel at the heel, which absorbs shock
  and allows a lower setting of release values</li><li> Antifriction devices reduce
  sliding between the boots and the bindings and keep release consistent</li><li>
  Look PX 10 Wide downhill ski bindings come with 100mm brakes, which are wide enough
  to fit most all-mountain wide skis</li></ul>
