<h3>With an adaptable and smart-looking design, the REI Snowcrest parka offers 3 levels of protection</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Wear the shell with the liner, wear only the shell or wear only the liner</li>
<li> REI Elements(R)-rated nylon shell is breathable, waterproof and windproof up to 60 mph</li>
<li> Hood has front and back volume adjustments to preserve vision, and hood's faux fur trim can be zipped on or off</li>
<li> Bonded placket protects 2-way front zipper and keeps wind from moving through; rip-and-stick closures secure placket</li>
<li> 1-hand-adjustable drawcord hem and adjustable cuffs seal in warmth</li>
<li> Pit zippers let excess heat escape; articulated arms enhance mobility and minimize hem lift when arms are raised</li>
<li> Shell has 2 snap-flap/zip handwarmer pockets and 2 snap-flap chest pockets; interior zip chest pocket has a cord port</li>
<li> Insulated liner jacket features cuffs with stretch binding, a 1-hand-adjustable drawcord hem, zippered hand pockets and an interior pocket with cord port</li>
<li> Polyfill synthetic insulation stays warm even when damp; Snowcrest liner's back length is 25</li>
<li>5 in</li>
<li> Liner is windproof to 50 mph</li>
<li> With the liner jacket zipped into the shell you'll get maximum protection and warmth; or wear either piece separately as climate conditions dictate</li>
<li> REI Snowcrest parka has a classic, easy-wearing fit</li>
</ul>
