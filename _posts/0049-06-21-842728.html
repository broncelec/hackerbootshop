<h3>The REI Lightweight Polartec(R) Power Dry(R) crew shirt performs well as a base layer underneath other insulating layers or on its own when wearing it in warmer temperatures</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Polartec Power Dry utilizes 2 different yarns on either side of the fabric to enhance comfort: interior yarn wicks moisture, and exterior yarn dries quickly</li>
<li> The combination of the 2 yarns helps keep you dry during highly aerobic activities because it moves moisture away from skin faster than single-component fabrics such as cotton</li>
<li> Updated fabric protects skin against harmful ultraviolet light with a UPF rating of 20, and is very soft to the touch</li>
<li> Flatseam construction is soft and non-chafing next to skin, and seams are designed to work with pack straps at shoulders</li>
<li> Underarm and side gussets promote freedom of motion</li>
<li> Dropped back hem stays tucked in; sleeves are long enough to cover biceps</li>
<li> The REI Lightweight Polartec Power Dry crew features a next-to-skin fit that hugs the body and boosts fabric performance</li>
</ul>
