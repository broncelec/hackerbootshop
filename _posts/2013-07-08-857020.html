description_list: <h4>The Jones Hovercraft snowboard offers a remarkable amount of
  float, yet is deisgned to be sized down 6 - 8 cm shorter than your average board</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> You won't believe how hard this board rips in the pow</li><li>
  Blower, crud and crust are no match for the Hovercraft as it floats through anything
  without sacrificing maneuverability in mixed conditions</li><li> Blunt nose and
  directional rocker keep you floating while the stiff tail and mellow Magne-Traction
  lock in stability when the fresh tracks are gone</li><li> Directional rocker offers
  more tip rocker than tail rocker and a slight camber in between the feet; blunt
  nose offers the float benefits of a longer board without added length</li><li> Mello
  Magne-Traction improves edge grip by adding five contact points along the running
  length of the board, resulting in amazing control whether riding ice or pow</li><li>
  Robust full wood core offers an even flex and amazing stability on hardpack; it's
  a true all-terrain core and certified by the Forest Stewardship Council</li><li>
  Wood topsheet; steel edges feature a beveled up edge along the tail for playful
  control; sintered base is fast and durable, and holds wax for all-day performance</li><li>
  P-tex waste is drastically reduced by flip-flopping base graphic colors between
  boards; base colors are random, thus specific requests cannot be accommodated</li><li>
