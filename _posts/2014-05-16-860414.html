  1223 women's snowshoes</h4><ul class="description"><li> The frames are shaped to
  accommodate a women's natural gait and the bindings are built to fit women's boots</li><li>
  Women-specific V-shaped frames are made from 7075 aluminum; they are the lightest

  and to facilitate easy, natural striding for women</li><li> Wrapp(TM) Pro bindings
  use low-friction ratcheting buckles, silicone straps and free-floating, padded tongues
  to supply a precise, comfortable and supportive fit</li><li> Tenacious, stainless-steel
  toe crampons deeply penetrate the firmest snow and bite into icy slopes</li><li>
  Stainless-steel serrated heel cleats and side traction rails provide sure footing
  while traversing and descending the most technical terrain</li><li> Spring-Loaded(TM)
  suspension uses offset webbing straps to create a springy platform beneath the feet
  that absorbs impact and allows natural side-to-side flex</li><li> Lightweight Duratek(TM)
  nylon decks are tough and built to withstand harsh, cold conditions; textured surfaces
  resist abrasion</li><li> Heel lift bars on the Atlas Elektra 1223 snowshoes relieve
