description_list: <h4>The REI Crestrail 70 pack incorporates the latest concepts in
  pack design, materials and components, balancing comfort with performance and durability
  for weekend or multiday trips</h4><ul class="description"><li> ActivMotion(R) hipbelt
  pivots to follow the natural motion of your hips, helping balance and stabilize
  the pack when you're hiking on uneven terrain</li><li> Hipbelt webbing tightens
  with a forward pull for easy adjustment; 2 zippered hipbelt pockets provide handy
  access to snacks</li><li> Sculpted FreeFlow back panel has multiple peaks and valleys
  that reduce contact areas and allow sweat vapor to escape; soft foam conforms to
  your back for a stable fit</li><li> Tubular aluminum perimeter frame saves weight
  compared to HDPE/stay framesheets; it moves weight to your hips and stabilizes the
  pack, helping prevent side-to-side sway</li><li> Top-loading main compartment also
  features 2 zippered access points to the main bag, plus separate zippered access
  to the sleeping bag compartment</li><li> Large zippered front pocket, stretch stash
  pocket and lightweight lash points store and organize often-used gear; floating
  top lid expands capacity to hold large loads</li><li> Side, bottle-locking pockets
  secure bottles or other items, helping prevent them from falling out when bushwhacking
  or taking your pack off</li><li> Strategically placed Speed Hook ice axe attachments
  avoid interference with pockets and access zippers</li><li> Top and side compression
  straps pull the load closer to your back, minimize bulk and create external attachment
  points for gear</li><li> Cordura(R) nylon fabric resists abrasion and tears; Durable
  Water Resistant finish and water-resistant zippers help keep your contents dry</li><li>
  The REI Crestrail 70 pack's hydration-ready design routes your reservoir's drink
  tube over either shoulder (hydration reservoir sold separately)</li></ul>
