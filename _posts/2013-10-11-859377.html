  82 skis with bindings boost confidence on difficult groomed terrain with stable
  83mm waists and vibration-reducing laminates</h4><ul class="description"><li> Poplar
  wood core creates light and lively skis that transmit the feel of the snow and put
  you in touch with the terrain, and stiff basalt laminates reduce vibrations</li><li>
  Varying shapes of laminates reduce the weight of the tips, making them easier to
  control</li><li> Layered laminates in tips also smooth out turn initiation, improve
  edge contact during turns and increase side-to-side response</li><li> Subtle rocker
  in tips and tails offers easy steering in any snow conditions, and traditional camber
  underfoot provides tenacious edge grip</li><li> Extended sidecut works with the
  rockered tips and tails to provide full engagement of edges during turns at high
  speeds and easy maneuverability at low speeds</li><li> Vertical sidewalls in center
  of skis deliver excellent power transfer for superb grip on hardpack snow</li><li>
  Integrated bindings are designed for ease of use and comfort; lightweight composite
  materials ease turn initiation for effortless skiing</li><li> Integrated bindings
