description_list: <h4>Taking you from groomers to soft snow to snappy performance
  in the half-pipe, the women's K2 MissConduct skis offer a versatile, go-anywhere
  85mm waist and a lightweight core for jumps and jibbing</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  K2 women's skis reduce the bulk and weight of all components to create very lightweight
  skis suited to the specific needs of female skiers</li><li> With a smooth flex for
  tail presses and tricks in the park, the Bioflex2 core combines aspen, paulownia
  and bamboo woods to deliver light weight and responsive performance</li><li> A fiberglass
  weave around the wood core provides torsional stiffness for highly responsive turning</li><li>
  Rockered tips initiate turns easily and offer agile performance on all kinds of
  terrain, and slight camber underfoot offers tenacious edge hold on firm snow</li><li>
  Modified sidewall construction increases durability for tricks in the park and transfers
  power directly to the edges of the ski to enhance turning</li><li> Tip and tail
  rivets help skis withstand hard landings and big impacts in the park</li><li> Base
  or topsheet color on the women's K2 MissConduct skis may vary from online photo</li></ul>
