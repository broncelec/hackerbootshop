description_list: <h4>The Petzl Pixa 2 Pro headlamp keeps your hands free for tasks
  at home and around the campsite</h4><ul class="description"><li> It has 2 modes
  to meet your distance and close-range lighting needs</li><li> Use the light on high
  to illuminate objects up to 30m away with 40 lumens of light; switch the light to
  low for proximity lighting that shines 20m and outputs 30 lumens</li><li> 2 AA batteries
  (included) provide up to 6 hrs</li><li> of use on high and 12 hrs</li><li> of use
  on low; battery indicator light lets you know when you need new batteries</li><li>
  Regulated output keeps the brightness and distance consistent throughout the life
  of the batteries</li><li> When the batteries are almost dead, the headlamp will
  continue to shine a 10m beam for 10 hrs</li><li> so you can still work until you
  have a chance to change the batteries</li><li> Reliable, strong and durable light
  is constructed to withstand 2m (6</li><li>6 ft</li><li>) falls and crushing by weights
  of up to 80kg (176 lbs</li><li>)</li><li> Can be worn as a standard headlamp or
  mounted on a helmet with the included plate; compatible with Petzl Vertex (2010
  version) and Alveo helmets (not included)</li><li> Take the back mounting plate
  off and the light can be placed on any flat surface and aimed up to light up tight
  spaces</li><li> Large on/off and mode-selector dial is easy to manipulate with gloves
  on</li><li> Light body rotates up to 45deg so you can aim the beam right where you
  need it</li><li> Always working in dirty, wet places? Not to worry! Pixa 2 Pro's
  IP67 rating indicates complete protection against dust and protection against submersion
  to 1m for 30 min</li><li> Battery case is easy to open and close for quick battery
  changes; compatible with alkaline, NiMH, NiCd and lithium batteries</li><li> When
  storing the light, pivot the body so the LED faces the backing plate to protect
  the glass from scratches; this position also prevents the light from being turned
  on</li><li> Comfortable headband easily detaches from the Petzl Pixa 2 Pro headlamp
  when you want to clean the light</li></ul>
