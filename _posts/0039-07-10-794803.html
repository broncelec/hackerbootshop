description_list: <h3>Built for the young backpacker, the 3-season REI Lumen kids'
  synthetic sleeping bag features amazing compressibility and warmth while balancing
  price and performance</h3><ul class="description"><li> This bag is built to the
  same insulation standard as the EN-rated REI Lumen +25degF adult sleeping bag</li><li>
  Synthetic Thermawave polyester insulation is durable and highly compressible; synthetic
  polyester fill retains some insulating properties even when wet</li><li> Shingle
  construction with overlapping layers distributes insulation evenly and keeps it
  from moving around so there are no cold spots</li><li> Equally distributed insulation
  accommodates the multi-position sleeper; mummy shape is thermally efficient, yet
  roomy enough to ensure sleeping comfort</li><li> Ripstop nylon shell fabric has
  a nice hand feel, is lightweight, durable, water- and abrasion resistant; nylon
  taffeta lining is soft and tear-resistant</li><li> Relaxed fit through the shoulders
  and hips gives you room to move for a better night's rest</li><li> Contoured hood,
  insulated full-face muffler, roomy footbox and full-length zipper draft tube with
  ground-level seams work together to keep heat in and cold out</li><li> External
  chest pocket keeps small essentials-headlamp, watch, glasses-right at hand and easy
  to find in the dark</li><li> Special pocket in hood can be stuffed with clothing
  layers to make a pillow that stays in place; no need for a pillow to take up valuable
  space in your backpack</li><li> Pad loops provide attachment points to keep your
  sleeping bag and pad together, so you needn't worry about rolling onto the cold
  ground (straps sold separately)</li><li> Full length zipper is backed by wide, antisnag
  binding tape</li><li> Differentiated drawcords (1 round, 1 flat) allow quick identification,
  even in the dark, so neck and hood adjustments are a cinch</li><li> Nylon stuff
  sack and cotton storage bag included</li><li> Ideal for 10 - 14 year olds</li></ul>
