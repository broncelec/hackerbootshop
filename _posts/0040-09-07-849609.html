<h3>The REI Sub Kilo +15 women's long sleeping bag with a left-hand zip offers a women-specific fit and extra length, so you don't need to resort to a men's bag on your 3-season backpacking adventures</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Women-specific fit features narrower shoulders and more room in the hips than men's bags; extra length accommodates sleepers up to 6 ft</li>
<li> tall</li>
<li> 3-season bag features premium 750-fill-power goose down insulation and a downproof ripstop polyester shell and soft polyester taffeta lining</li>
<li> Vertical Baffle construction lets the goose down remain fully lofted and keeps it from shifting and migrating, preventing cold spots</li>
<li> Contoured hood, roomy footbox, full-length locking zipper, full-length draft tube and draft collar all keep body heat in and cold air out</li>
<li> Internal pocket keeps all your essentials-headlamp, watch, glasses-close at hand and easy to find in the dark</li>
<li> Differentiated drawcords (one round, one flat) let you adjust hood and neck easily, even in the dark</li>
<li> Pad loops provide attachment points to keep your sleeping bag and pad together to avoid rolling off onto the cold ground (straps not included)</li>
<li> Left-hand zip design lets you zip the REI Sub Kilo +15 bag to compatible right-hand zip bags to create a double bed</li>
<li> Comes with stuff sack and large cotton storage bag</li>
