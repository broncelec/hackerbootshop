description_list: <h4>The women's REI Lyra 3-season backpacking synthetic sleeping
  bag features amazing compressibility and warmth while balancing price and performance</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> Women-specific bags are cut to match a woman's shape, and
  provide extra insulation for warmth</li><li> Tested by an independent third-party
  lab using European Norm protocol, the EN temperature ratings allow direct comparisons
  across brands with other EN-rated bags</li><li> Synthetic Thermawave polyester insulation
  is durable and highly compressible; synthetic polyester fill retains some insulating
  properties even when wet</li><li> 60% of insulation is put on top of bag where it
  contributes the most warmth and loft</li><li> Relaxed fit through the shoulders
  and hips gives you room to move for a better night's rest</li><li> Mummy shape is
  thermally efficient, yet roomy enough to ensure sleeping comfort</li><li> Ripstop
  nylon shell fabric has a nice hand feel, is lightweight, durable, water- and abrasion
  resistant; nylon taffeta lining is soft and tear-resistant</li><li> Shell fabric
  is treated with a Durable Water Repellent finish for water resistance and quick
  drying</li><li> Contoured hood, insulated full-face muffler, puffy interior yoke,
  roomy footbox and full-length-zipper draft tube with ground-level seams all work
  to keep heat in and cold out</li><li> External chest pocket keeps small essentials-headlamp,
  watch, glasses-right at hand and easy to find in the dark</li><li> Special pocket
  in hood can be stuffed with clothing layers to make a pillow that stays in place;
  no need for a pillow to take up valuable space in your backpack</li><li> Pad loops
  provide attachment points to keep your sleeping bag and pad together, so you needn't
  worry about rolling onto the cold ground (straps sold separately)</li><li> Full-length
  zipper is backed by wide, antisnag binding tape</li><li> Differentiated drawcords
  (1 round, 1 flat) allow quick identification, even in the dark, so neck and hood
  adjustments are a cinch</li></ul>
