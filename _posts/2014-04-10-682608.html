description_list: '<h4>Large-scale, topographic map of the Gray Wolf/Dosewallips area
  of Olympic National Park and Buckhorn Wilderness</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Has the same professional look and feel as a U</li><li> S</li><li> Geological Survey
  15'' topo map, including the standard 1:62,500 scale (1 inch to the mile)</li><li>
  However, instead of the USGS "quad" format, each map is laid out to include an entire
  area of interest, and entire trail systems on a single map</li><li> Trails were
  carefully field checked, re-mapped and depicted with easily visible red lines or
  dashes (depending on the maintenance class of the trail)</li><li> Accurate distances
  in miles and km, true woodland shading and up-to-date roads, road numbers, names
  and boundaries</li><li> Scale of 1: 62,500; contour intervals of 50 feet</li><li>
