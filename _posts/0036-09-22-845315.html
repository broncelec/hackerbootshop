  hybrid of warm, packable goose down on top, resilient synthetic fill underneath
  and waterproof fabric in key areas for great versatility</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  800-fill goose down on top of bag provides maximum warmth and compressibility; bag
  is rated to 32degF</li><li> Soft PrimaLoft(R) Sport synthetic insulation on the
  bottom of the bag provides a stable layer that continues to warm even if wet and
  dries quickly</li><li> Waterproof, breathable shell fabric on hood, side panels
  and footbox increases moisture resistance in areas that often come in contact with
  tent side walls</li><li> Ripstop nylon shell fabric on the rest of the bag is treated
  with a Durable Water Repellent finish to repel moisture and stains</li><li> Ultralight,
  mini-ripstop polyester lining is soft and comfortable against your skin</li><li>
  Baffles wrap around perimeter of sleeping bag to maximize warmth from head to foot;
  baffles keep the down from shifting, preventing cold spots</li><li> Performance
  fit saves weight by reducing girth at shoulders, hips and lower legs; trapezoidal
  footbox accommodates a natural sleeping position</li><li> Multichambered contoured
  hood, insulated full-face muffler, full-length zipper draft tube and ground-level
  seams all work to keep heat in and cold out</li><li> Differentiated drawcords (1

  backed by wide, antisnag binding tape; the REI Flash sleeping bag can be zipped
  to any other REI backpacking bag (women's bags zip on the right, men's on the left)</li><li>
