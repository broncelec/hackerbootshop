<h3>The tall REI Sahara Tech long-sleeve shirt features a thoughtful construction that will keep you comfortable while traveling from the desert to the tropics to alpine terrain</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Lightweight nylon fabric wicks moisture, dries quickly and breathes easily for great comfort; UPF 50+ rating provides excellent protection against harmful ultraviolet rays</li>
<li> Integrated mesh ventilation at the back yoke and under the arms helps keep you cool while traveling in warm climates</li>
<li> Cargo-style chest pockets provide ample space for travel essentials; envelope-style closures keep items secure without the weight of button or snap closures</li>
<li> Button-close pocket on left sleeve holds small items at the ready</li>
<li> Shoulder seams are rolled forward to reduce rubbing while wearing a backpack</li>
<li> Rear locker loop lets you easily hang the shirt up to dry</li>
<li> Use the cord loop on the left chest pocket to hold your sunglasses when they're not required</li>
<li> Features a button-close front placket</li>
</ul>
