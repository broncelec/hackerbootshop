description_list: <h4>Similar to other Klymit sleeping pads with a unique cut out
  design and high pressurized comfort, the big brother Inertia XL is wider and more
  supportive to accommodate more body shapes and sizes</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Klymit uses body mapping to support the key areas, such as the head, hips and feet
  and removes padding in less critical areas to reduce weight</li><li> Cutouts allow
  a bag's insulation to remain lofted, which maximizes warmth, rather than becoming
  compacted between your body and the pad</li><li> Using dynamic body mapping, V-shape
  chambers allow articulation of the pad so it stays with you as you move during the
  night</li><li> Inertia X-Frame pad can be inflated with just 4 - 6 breaths; to adjust
  firmness, use the included hand pump to increase air pressure in pad</li><li> Use
  it under or inside (so you'll never fall off) your sleeping bag</li><li> Pad features
  an integrated pillow/ergonomic head cradle</li><li> Rolled up, Klymit Inertia XL
  sleeping pad is about the size of a 16 oz water bottle</li><li> Pad includes a stuff
  sack, patch kit and dry air pump</li><li> Constructed from 75-denier polyester for
  durability</li></ul>
