description_list: <h4>Now iPO snowboard bindings were designed based on the movements
  of skateboard trucks, offering you a dynamic ride that transfers energy directly
  from the straps to your board</h4><ul class="description"><li> Glass-filled nylon
  hangers feature I-beam reinforcements that are rigid and light; floating design
  offers uninterrupted board flex and quickly transfers power to your edges</li><li>
  Hangers connect to hollow rivet Kingpin pivot point-the fulcrum for all energy transfer;
  the fulcrum change increases your edge-to-edge power</li><li> Stainless-steel rivets
  are extremely lightweight and strong</li><li> Alumi-ring discs reduce the amount
  of rigid board fixtures to help keep even flex; discs are compatible with all interfaces</li><li>

  quickly connect to Hangers; bushings apply energy while diffusing board chatter</li><li>

  rotated 5deg laterally for better edge control and comfort; higher medial side matches
  leg angle while wider lateral side provides support</li><li> Flex hinge built into
  binding highbacks damps chatter and eliminates calf bite by matching the contour
  and shape of your legs</li><li> Flushcup highback and heel cup interface holds your
  boots in place; bindings can be ridden in NoBack mode-heel cups will keep feet in
  place</li></ul>
