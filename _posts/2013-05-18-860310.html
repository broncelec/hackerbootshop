description_list: <h4>The advanced-level Volkl RTM 77 skis with bindings tear up the
  groomers with mellow rocker and offer enough waist width to float on soft snow when
  conditions are right</h4><ul class="description"><li> When tipped over and put on
  edge, the smooth, gradual rocker from tip to tail creates uninterrupted edge contact
  during the turn, ripping graceful arcs into groomed terrain</li><li> Full rocker
  also increases maneuverability in soft snow, so you can play on the backside of
  the mountain or hunt down overlooked stashes of pow</li><li> Raised reinforcement
  channels along the top edges of the skis, a distinct feature on all Volkl carvers,
  make the skis feel extra stable at high speeds</li><li> You'll also notice a lively,
  snappy feel when powering through turns thanks to the steel laminate built into
  the dual wood core</li><li> Bindings attach to skis via integrated rails, eliminating
  screws and promoting superb edge hold and natural flex</li><li> Integrated bindings
  feature DIN 3 - 11 release settings, a range suited to intermediate or advanced
  skiers at medium to high speeds</li><li> Base or topsheet color may vary from online
