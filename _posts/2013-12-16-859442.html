description_list: <h4>With a medium flex for aggressive intermediate skiers, the Lange
  RX LV 100 ski boots bring precision, comfort, and performance together in a low-volume
  boot with narrow lasts</h4><ul class="description"><li> Shells, liners and narrow,
  97mm footbeds are based on a composite scan of thousands of skiers' feet for anatomic
  accuracy and comfort</li><li> Shells are designed to create a centered, balanced
  stance on rockered skis to increase efficiency of technique and reduce fatigue</li><li>
  Uniform-density plastic shells ensure highly efficient power transfer, smooth flex
  and finely-tuned responsiveness, even in frigid temperatures</li><li> Control Fit
  liners conform to your feet for a comfortable, high-performance fit; liners may
  be custom molded using a heat treatment</li><li> Specially designed insteps provide
  an excellent fit at the midfoot, resulting in increased circulation and greater
  warmth</li><li> 1-piece toe boxes and tongues eliminate seams and overlaps in the
  tongue-attachment area to reduce pressure points at the instep and top of the toes</li><li>
  Rubber soles offer excellent grip</li></ul>
