  the deep stuff, the women's SKILOGIK Isis RL skis offer women skiers a beautifully-crafted
  wood veneer and easy-to-turn rockered tips</h4><ul class="description"><li> Rockered
  tips are easy to maneuver and offer excellent flotation in soft snow, and the relatively
  tight sidecut radius offers the versatility to carve groomers</li><li> The Isis
  RL skis are sculpted from the same top-end materials as all other SKILOGIK skis,
  but scaled proportionately to cater to the performance of women skiers</li><li>
  Construction consists of a hardwood core layered in a composite of carbon and fiberglass,
  topped with an eye-pleasing wood veneer that speaks to beautiful craftsmanship</li><li>
  Complementary wood cores ensure that your left ski and right ski have a matched
  flex pattern</li><li> Black locust hardwood sidewalls offer extra grip</li><li>
  92mm waists require bindings with wide brakes</li><li> Base or topsheet color may
  vary from online photo</li></ul>
