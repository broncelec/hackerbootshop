description_list: '<h4>Shimano XT Ice Tech SM-RT86 6-bolt disc rotor uses high-tech
  construction and design to reduce heat and improve braking response</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Ice Tech design offers advanced heat control for disc brake systems: the outer layers
  of the rotor are made of stainless steel, which are bonded to an aluminum core</li><li>
  This design captures the best of both worlds: the durability and powerful braking
  response of stainless steel along with the light weight and heat dissipation of
  aluminum</li><li> Plus, the strong aluminum spider dissipates even more heat and
  adds rigidity</li><li> Lower rotor operating temperatures means less power fade
  and improved brake pad longevity</li><li> The Shimano XT Ice Tech SM-RT86 6-bolt
  disc rotor is available in 160mm or 180mm sizes; sold as individual rotor and not
  compatible with Center Lock hubs</li></ul>'
