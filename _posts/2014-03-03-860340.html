description_list: <h4>The Ortovox 3+ RECCO(R) avalanche transceiver not only makes
  searching simple but it also makes it easier for rescuers to find you</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  And, it includes a RECCO reflector inside for backup protection</li><li> 3+ RECCO
  has the ability to analyze its vertical orientation when buried and transmit its
  signal on the transmitting antenna best positioned for searchers to pick up a signal</li><li>
  Most transceivers can only transmit on one antenna; by being able to transmit on
  two antennas, the 3+ has a consistent 40m range no matter what position it is buried
  in</li><li> The third antenna in the 3+ allows excellent precision and pinpoint
  search capabilities when you're zeroing in on a buried victim</li><li> Upon reaching
  a victim, the searcher can press the single button to mark the found victim and
  immediately set out for other burials by simply following the visual data</li><li>
  Marking a victim forces the transceiver to stop receiving the marked signal and
  focus on the next strongest signal; mark up to three victims</li><li> LCD screen
  features a circular display with a directional arrow and distance readout to guide
  you to the victim</li><li> Pinpoint search features semicircles around the edge
  of the screen that indicate whether you are getting closer to or farther away from
  the signal</li><li> Loud, intuitive acoustics help guide you to the buried transceiver
  when you're getting close</li><li> If the transceiver registers no movement for
  more than 2 min</li><li> while searching, it automatically switches back to transmit
  mode in case a second avalanche has struck</li><li> Internal RECCO reflector brings
  peace of mind by offering a backup means for finding a buried victim; more than
  700 ski areas and rescue teams around the world use RECCO</li><li> RECCO reflector
  enhances radio signals from search-and-rescue RECCO detectors, helping speed up
  the search for a buried avalanche victim</li><li> Compatible with all standardized
  avalanche beacons operating on the 457 kHz frequency</li></ul>
