<ul class="description">
<li> Made from quick-drying nylon, this shirt helps keep you cool and comfortable on warm, sunny days</li>
<li> Easy-care, lightweight micro-ripstop nylon wicks moisture, dries incredibly fast and delivers very good sun protection with a 40 UPF rating</li>
<li> Moisture-wicking polyester mesh lines the collar stand, shoulder yoke and side-seam vents</li>
<li> Vent across back yoke allows cooling airflow</li>
<li> Hidden zippered vents at side seams enhance airflow; vents are strategically placed so they won't get in the way of pack straps</li>
<li> Style-enhancing shirttail hem and front and back princess seams</li>
<li> Hidden zippered pocket stows credit cards and currency</li>
<li> Relaxed fit maximizes comfort without compromising your look</li>
