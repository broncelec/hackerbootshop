description_list: '<h4>The Sierra Designs Backcountry Bed 600 2-Season Sleeping Bag
  has an integrated comforter and no zippers for a unique outdoor sleeping experience
  through spring and summer</h4><ul class="description"><li> Climb into the bag via
  the large oval opening on top; the oversize comforter seals up the opening so you
  can sleep comfortably no matter your position: back, side or stomach</li><li> With
  a European Norm (EN) lower-limit rating of 27degF, the Backcountry Bed 600 2 -Season
  sleeping bag is suitable for spring and summer backpacking</li><li> On warmer nights,
  flip the comforter outside the sleeping bag and tuck it back for ventilation; insulated
  hand/arm pockets provide warmth when the comforter is outside the bag</li><li> Down
  is considered the best insulation available but when wet, it quickly loses loft
  and the ability to keep you warm; 600-fill-power DriDown is treated to resist moisture</li><li>
  Proprietary process treats each individual duck down plume with a molecular-level
  polymer so the down stays dry longer, lofts better and dries faster than untreated
  down</li><li> DriDown insulation stays dry 10 times longer, retains 170% more loft
  when exposed to moisture and dries 33% faster than untreated down</li><li> Ripstop
  polyester exterior endures frequent use in the outdoors; polyester taffeta lining
  is soft and comfortable next to skin</li><li> Sleeping pad sleeve on the bottom
  of the bag secures your pad (pad not included) to create the experience of a fully
  integrated bed</li><li> Sierra Designs Backcountry Bed 600 2-Season Sleeping Bag
  comes with a stuff sack and storage sack</li></ul>'
