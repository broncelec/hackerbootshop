description_list: <h4>The GSI Outdoors Commuter Java press mug cleverly eliminates
  the intrusive plunger rod found on classic French press designs and instead uses
  an inner mug with a filter on the bottom</h4><ul class="description"><li> Add coffee
  grounds to the outer mug, pour in hot water, and then push the inner mug down into
  the outer mug, letting the grounds steep to make the perfect cup of coffee</li><li>
  Spill-resistant, flip-top lid seals in heat and prevents your sloshing drink from
  escaping yet unscrews easily when you need to add sugar or cream</li><li> Inner/outer
  mug design also creates a double wall of insulation to keep drink hot while you're
  camping or on your way to work; recycled-neoprene sleeve adds extra insulation</li><li>
  Slim profile fits in many car cup holders so your coffee and tea can travel with
  you</li><li> The GSI Outdoors Commuter Java press is shatter resistant and 100%
  BPA free</li></ul>
