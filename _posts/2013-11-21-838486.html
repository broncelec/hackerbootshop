description_list: <h4>The Petzl NAO headlamp revolutionizes hands-free lighting with
  a sensor that automatically adjusts the beam pattern and light output so you don't
  have to</h4><ul class="description"><li> Whether you're reading a map or running
  a trail, the built-in light sensor measures the ambient light in order to adjust
  the 2 high-output LEDs instantly to meet your needs</li><li> When you're looking
  at an object at very close range, such as a map or piece of equipment, the light
  adjusts to a very wide beam with low output</li><li> As you make your way down the
  trail, the beam widens and adjusts to a medium light output in order to illuminate
  objects in the path</li><li> If you raise your head to see something in the distance,
  the beam becomes focused and the light intensity increases</li><li> Reactive lighting
  keeps your hands free longer because you don't need to press a button to adjust
  light output; it also extends battery life by efficiently using power</li><li> Download
  OS by Petzl software to modify the functionality of your NAO headlamp; you can adjust
  light intensity, burn time and distance according to an activity</li><li> Create
  custom activity profiles or select from pre-configured profiles such as trail running,
  mountaineering and hiking; load these onto the NAO and you're ready to go</li><li>
  OS by Petzl software is available for download from Petzl at www</li><li>petzl</li><li>com/OS</li><li>
  Headlamp can also be operated in Constant mode, which disables the sensor and gives
  you standard high and low output settings</li><li> Give the on/off switch a quick
  twist to navigate between high and low Reactive modes; hold the switch for 2 sec</li><li>
  to switch to Constant mode</li><li> 2 LEDs shine light up to 108m and output 355
  lumens on high Reactive mode and 55m and 98 lumens on low Reactive mode</li><li>
  Single Lithium-ion polymer 2,300 mAh battery can be recharged up to 300 times, making
  the battery life equivalent to that of hundreds of alkaline batteries</li><li> Battery
  provides 4 hrs</li><li> 40 min</li><li> of use in high Reactive mode and 8 hrs</li></ul>
