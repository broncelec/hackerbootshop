<h3>The REI Pinnacle 50 pack is ideal for overnight ascents and winter activities in the mountains</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Its beefy suspension and solid design handle alpine gear with ease</li>
<li> Removable hipbelt and framesheet let you strip down the pack to save weight and match the needs of your adventure</li>
<li> Perforated shoulder strap foam allows body vapor to pass through and evaporate; molded foam back panel handles abuse and delivers comfort</li>
<li> Top-loading design features a floating top lid and collar closure; side-zip access allows easy retrieval of items buried deep in the pack</li>
<li> Internal gear loops make it easy to rack and sort climbing gear; lash points let you secure bulky gear to the pack's exterior</li>
<li> Hydration sleeve accommodates a reservoir (sold separately); tube port lets you route the bite valve over either shoulder</li>
<li> Burly front pocket stores crampons and a jacket</li>
<li> Wand pocket is generously sized to also store small items like gloves and hats; exterior zippered pocket also keeps small items handy</li>
<li> Dedicated ski-tail loops and cam-lock buckles securely hold skis</li>
<li> Snow-specific buckles work well with gloves and won't clog with snow</li>
</ul>
