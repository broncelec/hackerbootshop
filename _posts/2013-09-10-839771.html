description_list: <h4>The Arc'teryx Quintic 38 snow pack is an efficient load carrier
  for the backcountry</h4><ul class="description"><li> It's designed for snow, yet
  underscores the idea that a backpack is an everyday tool, not a specialized accessory</li><li>
  Lowered, flat pack body centralizes the load around your core to distribute weight
  and keep it low in the lumbar area; narrow top and wide bottom center weight on
  the hips</li><li> Separate compartments help keep gear sorted, easy to access and
  balanced during travel; individual attachment points hold full-face or half-shell
  helmets and poles</li><li> External strap configuration accommodates A-frame or
  diagonal carry of skis and split, horizontal or vertical carry of a snowboard</li><li>
  Side-load main compartment is easily accessible in transit; separate compartments
  keep shovel, safety gear, food and extras balanced and organized</li><li> The Arc'teryx
  Quintic 38 snow pack features a top pocket for skins and goggles; a side water-bottle
  pocket and a top-loading tool kit compartment with sleeves for each item</li></ul>
