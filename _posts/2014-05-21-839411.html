description_list: <h4>Responsive and smooth, the Dalbello KR Two Core ski boots offer
  the precision to romp down the mountain with ease</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Completely redesigned boot mold enhances power, precision and comfort by matching
  4 critical fit points on your feet</li><li> Offering a precise foothold and a progressive
  forward flex, 3-piece shell optimizes responsiveness for today's relatively short,
  wide skis</li><li> Separate cuff, shell and tongue sections are joined together
  to create a smooth forward flex with precise side-to-side support</li><li> Enhancing
  side-to-side response and providing a snugger wrap, bi-injected cuffs feature stiff
  plastic on sides and soft plastic on the strap that wraps around shins</li><li>
  The Dalbello KR Two Core ski boots perform especially well with both fully cambered
  and modern rockered skis thanks to an upright cant and cuff angle</li><li> Medium
  flex tongues enhance responsiveness, control and sensitivity to skis and snow surface</li><li>
  Liners feature soft comfort foam around the rearfoot areas and tongues, and the
  toe boxes stretch to enhance comfort and fit</li><li> Liners are engineered to fit
  correctly right out of the box, but they can be custom formed as well, a procedure
  best performed in an REI specialty ski shop</li><li> For further information please
  contact your REI specialty ski shop</li><li> Cable instep buckle on each boot minimizes
  foot sliding, heel lift and shell distortion while flexing, and a specialized adjustment
  fine-tunes the cable tension</li><li> 3 microadjustable aluminum buckles on each
  boot create a precision fit; inverted bottom buckles won't come loose from contact
  with snow</li><li> Power straps lock in the cuffs and increase support</li><li>
  Twin canting adjusts the cuffs to fit the angles of your lower legs, levels the
  soles of the boots above the skis and offers a versatile range of adjustment</li></ul>
