description_list: <h4>Built for aggressive, all-mountain skiers who like a narrow,
  nimble waist, the Blizzard Brahma skis roam from groomers to pow with the agility
  of naturally rockered tips and tails</h4><ul class="description"><li> Blizzard builds
  the rocker without bending the core, creating a naturally flexing, responsive ski
  that turns easily, resists high-speed chatter and shreds crud and pow</li><li> Light
  camber underfoot assists with grip on hardpack</li><li> Wood core is constructed
  like a sandwich with layers of precisely-milled strips reinforcing each other to
  create a lightweight, snappy ski with smooth and easy handling</li><li> A dual titanium
  laminate increases stiffness during the turn, adding power that aggressive skiers
  will love</li><li> Sidewalls direct power right to the edges of the skis, resulting
  in quick side-to-side response</li><li> 88mm waists require bindings with wide brakes</li></ul>
