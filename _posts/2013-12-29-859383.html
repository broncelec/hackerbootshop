description_list: <h4>Fat planks for epic powder days, the newly designed Rossignol
  Star 7 women's skis feature lightweight construction combined with responsive powder-specific
  rocker to surf the sidecountry</h4><ul class="description"><li> Float like a feather
  on top of deep snow thanks to the rockered tips and tails; redesigned Powder Turn
  rocker minimizes the tendency of tips to flap at high speeds</li><li> Easy-to-turn
  honeycomb tip and tail are significantly lighter than previous models; you can actually
  see the light pass through the air-filled spaces in the honeycomb</li><li> You'll
  really appreciate the weight savings when the Star 7s are strapped to your pack
  and you hike up the ridge to get first tracks</li><li> The responsive strength of
  the skis shines when dropping into steep terrain, smearing a pillow line, and straight-lining
  it back to the base</li><li> Standard camber underfoot offers tenacious edge-grip
  on hardpack; there's more than enough camber to enjoy carving on groomers</li><li>
  The Star 7s feel extra smooth, especially at high speeds, thanks to the visco elastomer
  in the tip and tail that absorbs shock and resists chatter</li><li> 116mm waists
  require bindings with wide brakes</li><li> Base or topsheet color may vary from
