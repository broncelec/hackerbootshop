<h3>The REI Crestrail 70 pack incorporates the latest concepts in pack design, materials and components, balancing comfort with performance and durability for weekend or multiday trips</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> ActivMotion(R) hipbelt pivots to follow the natural motion of your hips, helping balance and stabilize the pack when you're hiking on uneven terrain</li>
<li> Hipbelt webbing tightens with a forward pull for easy adjustment; 2 zippered hipbelt pockets provide handy access to snacks</li>
<li> Sculpted FreeFlow back panel has multiple peaks and valleys that reduce contact areas and allow sweat vapor to escape; soft foam conforms to your back for a stable fit</li>
<li> Tubular aluminum perimeter frame saves weight compared to HDPE/stay framesheets; it moves weight to your hips and stabilizes the pack, helping prevent side-to-side sway</li>
<li> Top-loading main compartment also features 2 zippered access points to the main bag, plus separate zippered access to the sleeping bag compartment</li>
<li> Large zippered front pocket, stretch stash pocket and lightweight lash points store and organize often-used gear; floating top lid expands capacity to hold large loads</li>
<li> Side, bottle-locking pockets secure bottles or other items, helping prevent them from falling out when bushwhacking or taking your pack off</li>
<li> Strategically placed Speed Hook ice axe attachments avoid interference with pockets and access zippers</li>
<li> Top and side compression straps pull the load closer to your back, minimize bulk and create external attachment points for gear</li>
<li> Cordura(R) nylon fabric resists abrasion and tears; Durable Water Resistant finish and water-resistant zippers help keep your contents dry</li>
<li> The REI Crestrail 70 pack's hydration-ready design routes your reservoir's drink tube over either shoulder (hydration reservoir sold separately)</li>
</ul>
