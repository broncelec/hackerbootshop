  cold spots by keeping the goose down fully lofted and in place</li><li> Down-insulated
  draft tube backs the 2-way, full-length zipper to keep the cold out</li><li> Wrap-around

  in zipper</li><li> Marmot Plasma 30 Sleeping Bag features an ultralight stuff sack
  and storage bag</li><li> European Norm (EN) is an independent third-party temperature
  rating, allowing accurate comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags</li></ul>
