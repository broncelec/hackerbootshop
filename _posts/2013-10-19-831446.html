description_list: <h4>The Black Diamond Wiz headlamp lets youngsters enjoy hands-free
  lighting, just like the adults! Wiz was designed with children in mind; it's not
  only smaller than adult headlamps, it's thoroughly tested to standup to kid-type
  use</h4><ul class="description"><li> Elastic band has pull-away fittings so if a
  child catches it on a limb or door handle it simply comes apart under the pressure</li><li>
  Power of the 2 LED bulbs is set at mid brightness so kids don't unintentionally
  blind themselves-or their parents! But don't be concerned, the Wiz provides plenty
  of light for nighttime reading and walking around a dark campsite</li><li> Features
  2 modes, on and strobe, operated from a single, easily used switch</li><li> Headlamp
  automatically turns off after 1 hr</li><li> to save battery life, in case a child
  falls asleep with it on or forgets it lost under the covers</li><li> Tiltable housing
  lets a youngster adjust the natural direction of light to suit current needs</li><li>
  Operates on 2 AAA batteries, included</li><li> Blemished; item has minor cosmetic
  blemishes that do not affect product performance</li></ul>
