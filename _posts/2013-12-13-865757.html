  multifunction watch draws its power from the sun and combines the intuitiveness
  of analog with the convenience of digital</h4><ul class="description"><li> Multi-band
  atomic timekeeping function receives six radio signals a day (five in China) to

  light to recharge and lasts up to five months without recharging</li><li> Triple
  sensors enable easy, one-touch operation of an altimeter/barometer, compass and
