  rocky, uneven trails</h4><ul class="description"><li> Thermoplastic urethane shanks

  impact</li><li> Nylon mesh uppers with polyurethane overlays provide lightweight
  comfort and support</li><li> Polyester/nylon linings wick perspiration away from
  your feet and then dry quickly so your feet stay cool, comfortable and odor-free</li><li>

  and a featherweight cushion</li><li> Vibram rubber outsoles provide lightweight
  performance without compromising grip or stability; updated lugs on medial sides
