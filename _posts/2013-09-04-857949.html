  performance, Vans Infuse snowboard boots offer top-of-the-line features, an amazing
  fit and classic Vans styling</h4><ul class="description"><li> Vans Hybrid Boa lacing
  offers the best of both worlds: it combines traditional laces with a Boa closure
  that focuses primarily on the critical instep area of the boots</li><li> This configuration
  allows you to lace your boots tighter than with traditional laces only, and it also
  allows on-the-fly instep adjustments for boot flex</li><li> Custom Boa dials celebrate

  detailing</li><li> Power cuff strap brings liner and shell cuffs together for a
  perfect fit around your calves</li><li> Full-grain leather uppers feature a waterproof
  treatment for all-day protection from the elements</li><li> Custom X thermal liners
  have an exterior overlay support cage that provides leg and ankle support for an
  anatomic and supportive fit</li><li> Direct-connect rip-and-stick closures and cuff
  straps prevent liner movement</li><li> Internal web harnesses hold liners closed
  for secure fit and prevent them from slipping inside shells; lace locks maintain
  desired tension</li><li> Molded cork/recycled EVA high-rebound footbeds feature
  integrated arch support, dual-density metatarsal and heel impact-relief pads and
  Outlast-treated topsheets</li><li> Aggressive tacky rubber outsoles feature a hex-lug

  a true connection to your board</li><li> Each Vans Infuse boot has 2 RECCO(R) reflectors
