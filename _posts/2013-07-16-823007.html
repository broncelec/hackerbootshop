  class="description"><li> They offer mid-range support, slipperlike comfort and the

  around in the park or getting the guts to drop off that cliff, going bigger gets
  even better thanks to superior cushioning in Emerald boots</li><li> True Fit(TM)
  design considers every element, from liners to lace guides, and delivers the best
  fitting, most comfortable snowboard boots ever</li><li> Imprint(TM) 2 EVA liners
  wrap your feet in comfort; they''ll conform to your feet after a few days of riding
  or you can custom mold them at your local shop</li><li> Hot Pockets are small neoprene
  sleeves sized for disposable foot warmers (includes 2 pairs); they sit on top of
  your feet and warm up frigid toes</li><li> Liners feature long-lasting polyurethane
  energy panels and Quick Fit(TM) integrated lacing harness for easier-than-ever entry
  and exit</li><li> Strategically placed backstays ensure a consistent flex throughout
  boot life; even after being flexed repeatedly, they return and maintain their original
  position</li><li> Medium-flex, thin-profile 3D-molded tongues wrap the forefeet
  for seamless flex, and reduce performance-robbing shell/liner stack-up</li><li>
  Streamlined Speed Zone(TM) shell lacing system lets you fine-tune the fit quickly
  and easily; customize the upper and lower zones in a matter of seconds</li><li>
  3-part outsoles give you low-profile stability with an airbag design and EVA midsoles

  quick break-in period and increases warmth and comfort</li></ul>'
