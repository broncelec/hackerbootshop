description_list: <h4>The Mountain Hardwear Trango 3 Tent is designed for winter mountaineering</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> It's built strong and engineered to shelter 3 climbers
  in tough alpine conditions</li><li> 2 mesh/fabric doors provide easy entry and exit;
  large vestibule provides work-worthy space while smaller vestibule is handy for
  access, overflow storage and vent manipulation</li><li> Stiff but light fabric spreads
  the load-bearing capability of the poles over a wide surface area; ribbed wall fabric
  adds strength while remaining lightweight</li><li> DAC Featherlite(R) poles have
  a high strength-to-weight ratio and use extrusions instead of inserts to avoid breakage;
  poles are anodized without the use of harmful acids</li><li> Fully taped fly, taped
  perimeter seams, welded corners and welded guy clip anchors create a watertight
  shelter; mesh/fabric zippered through-vent ensures good air circulation</li><li>
  2 clear SVX windows are placed correctly to check the weather; tent's color fends
  off depression while you wait for the weather to improve</li><li> Catenary-cut seams
  create a taut canopy and rainfly for improved strength; dry-entry front vestibule
  with snow flaps prevents water from dripping in when the vestibule is open</li><li>
  Expedition bathtub-style nylon floor features a polyurethane coating and durable
  water repellent finish for waterproofness and durability</li><li> DirectConnect
  point secures tent body, frame and fly at each guy out point for a solid connection
  between all 3 components</li><li> Poles are color coded to the bar tacks in the
  webbing of the grommet tabs; reflective starter points make it easy to set up in
  low light</li><li> Internal guy system provides additional rigidity to the structure
  by creating resistance to the flexing or deformation of the frame</li><li> Superlight
  buckles and webbing save weight; canopy storage pockets help keep your tent organized</li></ul>
