  retains 80% of its insulating power even when dampened by rain, humidity or sweat,
  so you'll continue to stay warm</li><li> Small baffles in shell fabric allow insulation
  to fully expand to retain body heat; highly compressible ThermoBall insulation offers
  warmth equal to 600-fill-power goose down</li><li> Tightly-woven nylon shell features
  square stitching that helps hold insulation in place to keep it evenly distributed;
  Durable Water Repellent finish repels light moisture</li><li> Nylon lining wicks
  sweat off the skin for quick evaporation, helping you stay dry and comfortable</li><li>
  Quickly stuff the vest into its own space-saving, left-hand stow pocket for compact
  storage</li><li> Zippered hand pockets; full-length front zipper with internal windflap;
  stretch-bound arm-holes, low-profile drawcord hem</li><li> The North Face ThermoBall
