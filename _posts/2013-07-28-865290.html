description_list: <h4>The Vibram FiveFinger Bikila Evo Road-Running Shoes are fully
  redesigned and built for runners looking for shoes that give the benefits of going
  barefoot, but with a bit more cushion and support</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  With a total sole thickness of 8</li><li>5mm, the Bikila shoes are still very thin
  but have a bit more cushion so you can feel confident using the shoes on medium-distance
  road runs</li><li> Polyester mesh uppers breathe well to keep your feet cool and
  dry on long runs</li><li> Zero drop from heel to toe encourages a natural midfoot
  or forefoot strike to promote forward momentum and reduce the impact of heel striking</li><li>
  Individual toe slots enhance dexterity, control and stability to deliver a natural
  running motion; thermoplastic urethane toe bumpers enhance protection</li><li> 2mm-thick
  insoles provide comfort and cushioning underfoot</li><li> Quick-lace closure system
  and locking buckle allows for a comfortable custom fit with just 1 easy pull</li><li>
  Vibram(R) rubber pods on the bottoms add durability and provide great grip</li><li>
  In order to allow your feet to adapt to using different muscles, begin use of these
  shoes gradually and increase over time</li><li> Vibram FiveFingers Bikila Evo Road-Running
  Shoes are machine washable in cold water; air dry only, away from sun or heat source</li><li>
  To determine size, stand with heels against a wall and measure from the wall to
  the tip of the longest toe on each foot; use the longer of the 2 lengths with the
  size chart</li></ul>
