description_list: <h4>The evolv Geshido rock climbing shoes are all-around high performers
  for sport climbing, trad and bouldering</h4><ul class="description"><li> They offer
  great edging ability, and the thin profile lets you jam your feet in cracks</li><li>
  Down-cambered last and low-profile shape allow your big toes to stay bent in a position
  of power while you're climbing</li><li> Toe rands of varying thicknesses enhance
  durability in high-wear zones, such as the front of the toe, without being cumbersome</li><li>
  High-performance, 4</li><li>2mm TRAX(R) high-friction rubber soles stick tenaciously
  to rock</li><li> Flexible and durable leather and synthetic suede uppers resist
  stretching and dry quickly</li><li> Half-length MX-P 1mm midsoles have medium stiffness
  for edging power on long face routes yet are flexible enough for smearing</li><li>
  Microfiber lining in the forefeet, cotton in the heels and leather on the footbeds
  limit stretching and offer great comfort</li><li> Part of the Sharma Signature Series,
  the evolv Geshido rock shoes were designed by professional rock climber, Chris Sharma</li><li>
