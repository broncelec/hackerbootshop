<h3>The North Face Valkyrie soft-shell jacket for men is windproof to protect against the chill of summit winds, but its active fit and breathability make it a good choice for most any aerobic activity</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> GORE(R) WINDSTOPPER(R) is 100% windproof; water repellent and breathable; and makes less noise than a hardshell</li>
<li> WINDSTOPPER is tightly woven for abrasion resistance and stretchy comfort; microfleece lining offers soft, warm comfort and manages moisture</li>
<li> Pit zips vent excess heat</li>
<li> Helmet-compatible hood with hidden cord locks and laminated wire brim is fully adjustable for a close fit that provides unhindered peripheral vision</li>
<li> Soft, lined collar shields neck from the cold, and the interior draft flap rolls over zipper to protect chin from abrasion</li>
<li> Features a drawcord hem and adjustable cuffs</li>
<li> The North Face Valkyrie jacket has zippered handwarmer pockets placed so they won't interfere with pack straps or a climbing harness</li>
</ul>
