description_list: <h4>If you like to ride the entire mountain, from the park to deep
  pow to carving up groomers, choose Union Trilogy women's snowboard bindings</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> The strong and supportive design handles the whole mountain</li><li>
  Trilogy II bases are made wth high-quality DuPont(TM) Zytel(R) ST nylon; they're
  strong, supportive and secure, and offer balanced comfort and response</li><li>
  Baseplates are designed to be supremely strong with the smallest footprint possible;
  this promotes free, even board flex for sweet response, board control and durability</li><li>
  Lightweight injected EVA bushings damp vibrations underfoot to promote a comfortable
  ride and smooth, even board flex with no dead spots</li><li> Extruded aluminum heel
  cups undergo an anodizing process that further increases their strength by 30%;
  they'll maintain their shape no matter how much wear and tear they see</li><li>
  Multizone highbacks offer three different zones of flex for a transitional top-to-bottom
  flex, with the top third being the softest and the bottom third the stiffest</li><li>
  3D Direct-Connect ankle straps eliminate elasticity and evenly distribute pressure
  across feet and ankles for increased comfort and board control</li><li> Multi-position
  toe straps fit a wide range of boots; magnesium buckles are 4 times stronger than
  aluminum with only half the weight</li><li> Union Trilogy bindings are compatible
  with Burton The Channel M6 snowboards</li></ul>
