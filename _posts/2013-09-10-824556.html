description_list: <h4>The Dynafit Manaslu Lady of the Summit skis live for big-mountain
  adventures where powder snow is plentiful and steep lines abound</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Ultralight paulownia wood cores keep the skis light and exceptionally smooth on
  every turn</li><li> Biaxial prepreg fiberglass and carbon layers above and below
  the core provide good torsional stiffness and lateral reinforcement without weighing
  the skis down</li><li> 92mm ski waists (on the 169cm skis) float through powder
  and crud during big-mountain, high-speed descents; 23cm-long rockered shovels excel
  in soft snow</li><li> Dual radius sidecut, featuring a tight radius toward the front
  and a wide radius in the waist, allows both quick turn initiation and large turns
  at high speeds</li><li> Patented titanal Dynafit Ski Insert System eliminates the
  need to drill your ski for Dynafit bindings (sold separately) and creates excellent
  ski-to-binding holding strength</li><li> Patented SpeedSkinFix attachment system
  securely attaches Dynafit skins (sold separately) to skis</li><li> SpeedSkinFix
  system does not interfere with the attachment of other brands of skins that feature
  a tip loop and tail clip</li><li> Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li><li>
  Dynafit Manaslu Lady of the Summit skis have a sintered graphite coating on the
  bases to enhance glide and improve wax retention</li></ul>
