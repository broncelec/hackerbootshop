description_list: <h4>From hardpack and crud to powdery backside bowls, the advanced-level
  Volkl Kenja skis for women gracefully carve up the mountain thanks to their 87mm
  waists and lightweight construction</h4><ul class="description"><li> Skis are quick
  and responsive across all terrain and in all conditions, and 87mm waists offer enough
  flotation to enjoy the occasional powder stash</li><li> Wood core uses lightweight
  and structurally sound balsa wood along with poplar, for a core that's lighter and
  more flexible than comparable unisex skis</li><li> With a vertically laminated core
  and vertical sidewalls, the Kenja skis turn easily from edge to edge and are responsive
  to aggressive turns at high speed</li><li> Tough Box construction sheathes the wood
  core in composite and fiberglass to remain durable during high speed landings and
  to snap back quickly from aggressive turns</li><li> You'll appreciate the smooth,
  powerful snap of these skis thanks to 2 full-length titanium laminates that absorb
  vibration and increase the feel of the terrain</li><li> Slight rise in the tips
  makes it easy to start turning and offers forgiving stability in crud, and standard
  camber underfoot enhances maneuverability on groomed runs</li><li> Low tip reduces
  chatter on groomed runs and resists diving in soft snow</li><li> Stiff flex zone
  in front adds stability, and medium flex underfoot transitions to the soft tail
  that aids in turning on groomers and maneuvering in pow</li><li> Directional twin
  tip heavily favors skiing forward but allows you to ski and land jumps backward
  if needed</li><li> Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
