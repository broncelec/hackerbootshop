description_list: <h3>The REI Heavyweight Polartec(R) Power Dry(R) Crew shirt offers
  proven value in a substantial base layer for all your hiking, mountaineering or
  snow-sports adventures</h3><ul class="description"><li> Polartec Power Dry uses
  two different yarns on either side of the fabric to enhance comfort; interior yarn
  wicks moisture and exterior yarn dries quickly</li><li> Combination of the two yarns
  helps keep you dry during highly aerobic activities because it moves moisture away
  from skin and dries more quickly than single-component fabrics</li><li> Soft, flat
  seams help eliminate chafing; seams at the shoulders are strategically positioned
  to work with pack straps; underarm and side gussets promote freedom of motion</li><li>
  Next-to-skin fit hugs the body, maintaining skin contact to boost fabric performance</li><li>
  Longer length helps the REI Heavyweight Polartec Power Dry Crew shirt stay tucked
  in; smooth texture of outer surface makes it easy to slide on additional layers</li><li>
  Fabric offers a UPF rating of 50+ to protect against harmful UV light</li><li> Closeout</li></ul>
