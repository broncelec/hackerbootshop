description_list: <h4>Featuring a very comfortable fit, the women's Nordica Transfire
  R1W ski boots drive the rockered and cambered shapes of modern skis with precision</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> The Nordica Transfire R1W uses a new shell design to enhance
  side-to-side control, offering precise lateral pressure to put modern skis on edge</li><li>
  Boots flex lightly at first, then as you put greater pressure on tongues during
  turn, the resistance increases and enhances precision</li><li> After flexing, boots
  return to upright position instantly, setting you up for the next turn</li><li>
  In addition to flexing progressively, the Transfire R1W boots feature a block in
  the spine of the boot that ensures the boots do not engage the skis too quickly</li><li>
  Getting your foot in the boot is hassle free thanks to a forgiving 3-piece shell
  design</li><li> Padding in the tongues and cuffs absorbs shock and damps vibrations,
  making your ride smooth and easy</li><li> As compared to men's liners, women-specific
  liners feature extra padding in the tongues, more insulation throughout and contoured
  top edges designed to fit women's calves</li><li> Liners snugly wrap the feet in
  cushioning foam and warm faux-fur lining; closed-cell foam against the shell enhances
  warmth</li><li> Liners provide a personalized fit around heel, ankle and center
  of foot when custom molded</li><li> Middle buckles clamp down on feet at a 45deg
  angle to keep heels securely seated and increase comfort in forefeet</li><li> Power
  strap acts as a fourth buckle, allowing you to set the firmness around the upper
  ankle to favor comfort or performance</li><li> Double canting adjusts the cuffs
  to fit the angles of your lower legs and offers a versatile range of adjustment</li><li>
  100 flex index provides the responsive power transfer preferred by expert skiers</li><li>
  102mm-wide forefoot offers a great mix of comfort and precision</li></ul>
