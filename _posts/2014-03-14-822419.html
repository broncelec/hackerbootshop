description_list: <h4>The lightweight Fischer S-Bound 88 skis let you carve turns
  and cover a lot of ground on your backcountry tours</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Sidecut and a specially tuned camber keep the skis lively in soft snow</li><li>
  Fiberglass wood cores feature air channels that keep weight down while maintaining
  good strength and durability</li><li> Features 5/10 Nordic Rocker camber that gives
  the skis great turning characteristics and control in variable snow conditions</li><li>
  5/10 Nordic Rocker indicates that when pressure is applied the ski tips lift 5mm
  and the location of the ski-to-snow contact point at the front of the skis moves
  back 10cm</li><li> Offtrack Crown waxless pattern on the bases provides good grip
  while you're touring in fresh snow</li><li> Full metal edges dig into hard snow
  and ice to optimize control on steep terrain</li><li> Universal stone grind on the
  bases of the Fischer S-Bound 88 skis provides good glide in all snow conditions</li><li>
