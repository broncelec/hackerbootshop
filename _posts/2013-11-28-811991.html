description_list: <h4>The Obi 1P tent is the black belt martial artist of the NEMO
  lineup</h4><ul class="description"><li> It's a finely tuned instrument, with not
  one ounce of material wasted; every feature and detail is driven by purpose and
  strategy</li><li> Subtly moving the front pole hub overhead gives the pole skeleton
  shoulders, creating more interior volume without the need for an additional ridge
  pole</li><li> Raised waterproof tub floor allows fly cutouts which save significant
  weight while improving ventilation</li><li> Obi 1P features a covered entrance with
  a generously-sized vestibule</li><li> Enjoy 21 sq</li><li> ft</li><li> of interior
  space at only 2 lbs</li><li> 8 oz Hubbed pole intersections create a single-corded
  pole for quick and easy setup; it also allows freestanding support while minimizing
  total pole weight for the tent</li><li> Configure vestibule fully opened, closed
  or partially deployed depending on the weather</li><li> Lightweight and strong DAC(R)
  NSL pole system with press-fit connectors and lightweight hubs uses an anodization
  process without harsh acids</li><li> DAC pole clips are easy to use and more durable
  than standard pole clips</li><li> DAC Jake's Feet(TM) corner anchor system setup
  is fast and easy; when fly is attached they act as cantilevers to pull the corners
  of the inner tent closer to the ground</li><li> Jake's Feet also allow you to set
  up your fly and poles without the inner tent to create an ultralight shade or shelter;
  optional footprint for this setup is sold separately</li><li> A combination of venting
  options in the Obi 1 helps promote good air circulation</li><li> Includes reflective
  guyouts, inside mesh pockets and light-diffusing headlamp pocket</li><li> Average
  minimum weight specification is based on tent, rainfly and poles only</li></ul>
