description_list: <h4>Stable and smooth in all conditions, the powder-loving Nordica
  Patron skis use a chatter-reducing tip design, 113mm waists, and a powder-specific
  rockered profile to surf deep snow</h4><ul class="description"><li> 113mm waists
  offer ample flotation, and early-rise tips and tails enhance maneuverability in
  deep snow</li><li> Powerful wood core with glass and carbon reinforcements produces
  a lightweight ski with playful responsiveness</li><li> Cambered and rockered profile
  enhances handling in deep snow, making it easy to take advantage of every feature
  on the mountain</li><li> Standard camber underfoot enhances maneuverability on groomers
  and variable snow; when weighted, 50% of the ski contacts the snow</li><li> Low,
  broad nose extends over the snow just enough to enhance flotation without becoming
  really noisy and vibrating on groomed terrain at high speeds</li><li> Directional
  twin-tip taper slightly favors skiing forward, but it also lets you ride switch
  and land jumps backward</li><li> Nordica Patron skis feature 113mm waists that require
  bindings with wide brakes</li><li> Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
