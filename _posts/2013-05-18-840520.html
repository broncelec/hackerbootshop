  performance and energy transmission</li><li> Comfortable liners feature a layer
  of custom-moldable foam that personalizes the fit around the shin</li><li> Neoprene
  toe boxes absorb shock and increase insulation, and extra-wide cuff openings make
  it easy to get your feet in the boots</li><li> Loops on tongues make it easy to
  put the boots on</li><li> Microadjustable titanium buckles shave weight off the
  boots and provide performance-enhancing stiffness</li><li> 35mm straps enhance wrap
  and support along upper ankles and increase the boots' forward rigidity</li><li>
  Single canting sets cuffs to different forward lean angles depending on how aggressively
  you ski</li><li> Salomon Impact 90 ski boots feature a flex index of 90 that provides
  the medium flex preferred by progressing intermediate skiers</li><li> 100mm last
  envelops the foot with an anatomic fit, so every bit of control pressure is transferred
  to the ski</li></ul>
