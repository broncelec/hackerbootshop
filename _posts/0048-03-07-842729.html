<h3>The REI Lightweight Polartec(R) Power Dry(R) long-sleeve crew performs well as a baselayer underneath other insulating pieces or on its own in warmer weather</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Polartec Power Dry utilizes 2 different yarns on either side of the fabric to enhance comfort: interior yarn wicks moisture, and exterior yarn dries quickly</li>
<li> The combination of the 2 yarns helps keep you dry during highly aerobic activities because it moves moisture away from skin faster than single-component fabrics such as cotton</li>
<li> Updated fabric protects skin against harmful ultraviolet light with a UPF rating of 20</li>
<li> Flatseam construction is soft and non-chafing next to skin; seams are designed to work under pack straps at shoulders</li>
<li> Underarm and side gussets promote freedom of motion</li>
<li> Dropped back hem stays tucked in</li>
<li> The REI Lightweight Polartec Power Dry long-sleeve crew features a next-to-skin fit that hugs the body and boosts fabric performance</li>
</ul>
