description_list: <h4>The Voile Charger skis combine early-rise tips with traditional
  camber underfoot for excellent performance in backcountry powder and the ability
  to carve hard snow on your way back to the car</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Lightweight construction makes these skis a good choice for tours in deep snow;
  aspen wood cores are wrapped in fiberglass that is woven with carbon for a light,
  snappy feel</li><li> Early-rise tips help you float through the deep powder on the
  descent and ease trail breaking in deep snow during the ascent</li><li> Tails of
  the skis turn up just a touch and are compatible with the tail attachments of most
  climbing skins (sold separately)</li><li> Traditional sidecut underfoot lets you
  carve turns on firm snow as you make your way out of the woods</li><li> Voile Charger
  skis have sintered bases that retain wax well and provide good glide</li><li> Base
  or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
