description_list: <h4>The Mountain Hardwear Hoop Dreams 4 is a lightweight teepee-type
  backpacking shelter</h4><ul class="description"><li> It does double duty as a sun
  shelter for the beach or park, and also at open-air festivals and events</li><li>
  Traditional round shape deflects wind; modern structure and reinforced stretch-free
  seams keep it light and stable; comfortably seats 4 campers</li><li> This design
  is a great alternative to cramped tents; the lightweight architecture creates a
  large, symmetrical open space with a minimum of materials</li><li> 1 Trussring(TM),
  1 lightweight center pole and durable polyester fabric separates and protects campers
  and their gear from the elements</li><li> Patented Trussring support system (ring
  pole) greatly increases internal volume at head level, adds structural strength
  and provides a place to string a clothesline</li><li> Ring insertion aid ensures
  a hassle-free setup; it prevents the DAC ring pole from pulling out of the insertion
  point while the tent is being set up and staked out</li><li> Light yet strong, DAC
  Featherlite(R) NSL poles are anodized without the use of harmful acids</li><li>
  Single door opens wide for stargazing or closes tight for weather protection</li><li>
  6 guyout points allow the Hoop Dreams shelter to be securely staked out</li><li>
  Hang loop allows shelter to be pitched without a center pole; shelter can also be
  pitched with a single trekking pole, sold separately</li><li> Mountain Hardwear
  Hoop Dreams 4 comes with stuff sack, DAC ring pole, DAC center support pole and
  9 aluminum stakes</li><li> Buggy environment? Not a problem; add the Mountain Hardwear
  Nothing But Net 4 (sold separately) to create a bug-free, covered shelter</li></ul>
