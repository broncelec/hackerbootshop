description_list: <h4>Stuffed with 700-fill DriDown(TM) insulation, the women's Sierra
  Designs Eleanor 24 sleeping bag will keep you toasty on cold-weather camping trips</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> Down is widely considered the best insulation available,
  but when wet it quickly loses loft and the ability to keep you warm; DriDown is
  treated to resist moisture</li><li> Proprietary process treats each individual goose
  down plume with a molecular-level polymer so the down stays dry longer, lofts better
  and dries faster than untreated down</li><li> DriDown insulation stays dry 10 times
  longer, retains 170% more loft when exposed to moisture and dries 33% faster than
  untreated down</li><li> Women-specific bags are cut to match a woman's shape, and
  provide extra insulation and warmth in the hood and feet areas</li><li> Lightweight
  yet durable 30-denier micro-ripstop polyester shell and comfortable, moisture-wicking
  polyester lining warm up fast</li><li> Baffle construction keeps down from migrating,
  eliminating cold spots</li><li> Full-length 2-way, double sliding zipper allows
  easy venting; locking slider is backed by wide, antisnag binding tape</li><li> Snag-free
  zipper tracks prevent the dreaded stuck zipper by creating a barrier between the
  lining and the zipper track</li><li> Fully insulated draft tube backing the zipper
  keeps body heat in and cold air out</li><li> Ergonomic, nonrestrictive hood cradles
  your head in warmth; hood features differentiated drawcords that make fit adjustments
  easy, even in the dark</li><li> Roomy, ergonomically shaped footbox enhances comfort
  and warmth of feet</li><li> Sierra Designs Eleanor 24 comes with stuff sack and
  storage bag</li><li> European Norm (EN) is an independent third-party temperature
  rating, allowing accurate comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags</li></ul>
