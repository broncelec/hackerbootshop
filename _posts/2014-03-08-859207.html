description_list: '<h4>Created to go where other bikes flounder, the fat-tire Surly
  Pugsley bike offers enhanced traction across sand, mud, wet rocks and roots, ice
  and many kinds of snow thanks to its oversize tires</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Big, fat tires provide lots of flotation, more ground contact and better traction,
  especially when run at low pressures, allowing the tires to ride over obstacles</li><li>
  Frame is made of sturdy 4130 chromoly steel with double-butted tubing in the main
  triangle for strength</li><li> SRAM X5 36/22 crankset is matched up with Shimano
  derailleurs and Microshift shifters to create a smooth, easily shiftable drivetrain,
  even with gloves on</li><li> Horizontal dropouts with a derailleur hanger mean you
  can run the Pugsley as-is, or go to an internally geared hub, fixie or single-speed
  later on</li><li> Avid BB7 mechanical disc brakes facilitate controlled deceleration
  and sure stopping power in mixed conditions</li><li> Finer details include 2 water
  bottle mounts and guides for continuous brake/shift housing to protect cables in
  harsh conditions</li><li> The Pugsley also has rack and fender eyelets (rack and
  fenders not included-please note: rack and fenders will need to accommodate oversize
  tires)</li><li> Pedals not included</li><li> Specs on the Surly Pugsley bike are
  subject to change</li></ul>'
