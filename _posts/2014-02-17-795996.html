  excellent choice for cold, demanding trips as well as car camping and backpacking
  trips</h4><ul class="description"><li> Soft, compressible Thermic MX(TM) fill is
  engineered to provide 3-dimensional, springlike loft for superior warmth and minimal
  weight</li><li> Offset quilt construction means no sewn-through seams and no cold
  spots</li><li> Warmth is optimized through differential cut of shell and lining
  fabrics, allowing adequate room for the insulation to expand to its full loft</li><li>
  Slightly wide cut gives you extra room to move inside the bag; Comfort mummy cut
  efficiently maximizes warmth without constriction</li><li> Tailored hood with face
  gasket forms around head to seal in heat</li><li> Comfort footbox allows feet to
  rest naturally, angled out slightly with toes pointing, while fully preserving insulation
  loft for maximum warmth</li><li> Insulated draft tube (backing the 2-way, full-length
  zipper) and insulated zipper gusset seal in heat</li><li> Antisnag construction
  prevents fabric from catching in the zipper; locking sliders keep the zipper in
  place for ventilation options</li><li> Comes with microfleece-lined stuff sack that
  doubles as a pillow</li></ul>
