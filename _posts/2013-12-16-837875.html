description_list: <h4>The Petzl Pixa 3R rechargeable headlamp lets you configure the
  lighting performance so you can put a priority on either battery power or beam brightness,
  depending on your needs</h4><ul class="description"><li> Configure lighting performance
  to your needs by simply twisting the on/off dial; choose from Standard, Max Power
  and Max Autonomy configurations</li><li> Standard configuration is a compromise
  between lighting power and battery life, and will meet your needs most of the time</li><li>
  Use the light in Max Power configuration for short tasks that require a bright beam;
  Max Power provides a 55-lumen beam in any mode</li><li> Switch to the Max Autonomy
  configuration to maximize battery power and guarantee 12 hrs</li><li> of battery
  life in any mode</li><li> In the Standard and Max Power configurations, the Pixa
  3R illuminates objects up to 75m away with 55 lumens of light on high</li><li> Standard
  configuration on medium throws a 35-lumen beam up to 35m; use the headlamp on low
  for proximity lighting that shines 15m and outputs 25 lumens</li><li> Rechargeable
  lithium ion battery provides up to 12 hrs</li><li> of use on low, 6 hrs</li><li>
  on medium and 3 hrs</li><li> on high in the Standard configuration</li><li> Battery
  indicator light lets you know when the battery needs to be recharged</li><li> Plug
  the headlamp into the included charging dock to recharge the battery in only 3 hrs</li><li>;

  to charge the battery</li><li> Reliable, strong and durable light is constructed
  to withstand 2m (6</li><li>6 ft</li><li>) falls and crushing by weights of up to
  80kg (176 lbs</li><li>)</li><li> Can be worn as a standard headlamp or mounted on
  a helmet with the included plate; compatible with Petzl Vertex (2010 version) and
  Alveo helmets (not included)</li></ul>
