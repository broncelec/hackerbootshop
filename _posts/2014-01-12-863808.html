description_list: <h4>A choice of guides and serious alpinists, the Mountain Hardwear
  Direttissima 50 Pack hits the sweet spot with a balance of durability, versatility
  and light weight for one-day to multiday climbs</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  The Direttissima 50 transforms for each stage of a climb; start out with full-featured
  comfort and support, then strip out weight and bulk as the climb becomes more technical</li><li>

  camps; swap the padded hipbelt for a webbing belt for lighter loads and summit bids</li><li>
  HardWave suspension conforms comfortably to the curve of your back and distributes
  weight evenly but is removable for carrying light loads</li><li> Large zippered
  front pocket and separate, easy-access crampon pocket allow storage of often needed
  items or tools; pockets maintain volume even when main compartment is full</li><li>
  Removable top lid features 2 compartments for organizing essentials</li><li> Multiple
  lash points and long compression webbing allow for overloading while effectively
  reducing volume as needed to keep any size load stable</li><li> The Mountain Hardwear
  Direttissima 50 Pack features a tough X-Ply ripstop front panel that offers extreme
  abrasion resistance and tear strength at an incredibly light weight</li></ul>
