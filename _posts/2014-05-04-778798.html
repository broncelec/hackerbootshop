description_list: <h4>The no-compromise Dura-Ace CN-7901 chain, specifically designed
  to be used with Shimano 10-speed drivetrains, has new asymmetry that improves its
  contact with cogs</h4><ul class="description"><li> Newly designed outer and inner
  plates provide better contact with gear teeth for smoother shifting-even highly
  loaded shifting</li><li> New design decreases pedaling noise, smooths pedaling and
  creates less chance of chain drop</li><li> Hollow pins and perforated plates save
  weight</li><li> Improved pin fittings reduce chain flexing; you'll enjoy stable
  shifting performance and feel even when the chain is stretched</li><li> Not compatible
  with 9-speed systems</li></ul>
