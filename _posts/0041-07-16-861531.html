description_list: <h4>The North Face ThermoBall(TM) hoodie jacket for men puts revolutionary
  new ThermoBall(TM) synthetic insulation to work</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Warm and light, it mimics down, yet still insulates even when wet</li><li> Functioning
  like down feathers, the tiny round clusters of ThermoBall spun polyester trap warm
  air, while softly conforming to your body's shape</li><li> ThermoBall retains 80%
  of its insulating power even when dampened by rain, humidity or sweat, so you'll
  continue to stay warm</li><li> Small baffles in shell fabric allow insulation to
  fully expand to retain body heat; highly compressible ThermoBall insulation offers
  warmth equal to 600-fill-power goose down</li><li> Tightly-woven nylon shell features
  square stitching that helps hold insulation in place to keep it evenly distributed;
  Durable Water Repellent finish repels light moisture</li><li> Nylon lining wicks
  sweat off the skin for quick evaporation, helping you stay dry and comfortable</li><li>
  Quickly stuff the jacket into its own space-saving, left-hand stow pocket for compact
  storage</li><li> Attached hood; zippered hand pockets; full-length front zipper
  with internal windflap; stretch-bound cuffs, low-profile drawcord hem</li><li> The
  North Face ThermoBall hoodie jacket has a standard fit and is machine washable</li><li>
  ThermoBall technology has been thoroughly tested by The North Face athletes, including
  Conrad Anker and Jimmy Chin, during summit trips on Denali and Mount Meru</li></ul>
