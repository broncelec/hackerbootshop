<h3>Unlike cramped tents that sacrifice space for weight savings, the strong, 3-person, 3-season REI Quarter Dome T3 Plus tent feels so roomy inside you may forget it's actually designed for backpacking</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> REI Quarter Dome T3 Plus features an additional 7</li>
<li>5 sq</li>
<li> ft</li>
<li> of floor space, an additional inch of headroom and larger vestibules compared to the standard Quarter Dome T3 tent</li>
<li> Two side entry doors and Dry Entry vestibules offer convenient access and ample storage capacity</li>
<li> REI-exclusive Tension Truss design enhances structural stability, prevents deformation in the wind and maximizes room around your head and shoulders</li>
<li> Aluminum DAC Featherlight NSL hubbed poles are lightweight; set-up is quick and easy with pole clips and color coding</li>
<li> Rectangular floor plan makes it easy to arrange sleeping bags and gear, and allows efficient use of space</li>
<li> Fully adjustable, high-level vents mitigate condensation, drawing cool air under the fly from the lower perimeter and exhausting warm, moist air</li>
<li> Bathtub floor with seam-sealed corners ensures waterproof protection</li>
<li> Windproof, breathable perimeter fabric blocks dust and sand from blowing in under the fly</li>
<li> Silicone-treated, lightweight ripstop nylon fly stays taut in the rain, avoiding moisture-transfer to the tent while keeping you dry</li>
<li> No-Wick welded construction ensures that moisture won't wick through susceptible areas such as guyout points, pole wraps or zippers</li>
<li> REI Quarterdome T3 Plus tent offers multiple interior mesh side pockets and hang loops for organization</li>
<li> Tent doors stuff into their own stash pockets for out-of-the-way convenience</li>
<li> Includes tapered, easy-to-stuff compression stuff sack, 6 stakes, 4 guylines and tighteners, pole repair tube, pole and stake bags</li>
<li> Fly/footprint minimalist pitch option lets you leave the tent at home and use the fly, poles and footprint (sold separately) as a lightweight shelter</li>
