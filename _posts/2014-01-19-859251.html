description_list: <h4>Medium-flexing intermediate-level boots, the women's Salomon
  X Pro 80 ski boots offer excellent performance for steep terrain and fast turns
  and feature heat-moldable shells to personalize the fit</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Heat-moldable shells adapt to your feet for a superior fit that eliminates pressure
  points and improves performance</li><li> Two-part "Twinframe" construction is composed
  of a rigid lower shell for power transmission and precision and a more supple upper
  shell for comfort</li><li> Rigid lower shell provides power transmission where it's
  needed in the heels, along the sides of the feet and in the binding contact areas</li><li>
  More supple upper shell offers appropriate rigidity above the instep, in the progressively
  flexing cuffs and in the supportive and flexing backbone of the shell</li><li> Oversize
  25mm pivot between bottom shell and upper cuff results in greater transmission and
  power distributed throughout the sole of the boot compared to typical 8mm pivots</li><li>
  Pre-shaped liners grip ankles and heels without too much pressure, and custom-moldable
  foam conforms under feet, over insteps and along shins for superior foothold</li><li>
  Women-specific liners feature a wider forefoot area, low volume around the ankle
  and an upper cuff shaped for women's calf muscles</li><li> The women's Salomon X
  Pro 80 ski boots have a medium flex index, providing the responsive power transfer
  appropriate for intermediate skiers</li></ul>
