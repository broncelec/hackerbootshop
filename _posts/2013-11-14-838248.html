description_list: <h4>Explore winter snowscapes with these Atlas 930 snowshoes, which
  offer great value and performance for those with any level of snowshoeing experience</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> Durable frames are crafted from 6061 aluminum to create
  a stiff yet lightweight chassis</li><li> Nose and tail shapes are optimized to provide
  a balanced platform for stable footing and facilitate an easy, natural stride</li><li>
  Free-Rotating(TM) Suspension lets the binding rotate much farther forward than previous
  Atlas designs, freeing up the stride and reducing the amount of tail flip</li><li>
  The result of the design is that freedom of movement is increased, the toe crampon
  can bite into snow better and the foot is allowed a more natural rotation</li><li>
  Wrapp(TM) Trail bindings use a continuous webbing design that tightens snugly with
  a single pull; bindings also cradle feet and arches for a secure, comfortable fit</li><li>
  Abrasion-resistant, lightweight Nytex(TM) nylon decks stay flexible when cold and
  stand up to the elements for lasting use</li><li> Steel toe crampons supply sure-footed
  traction on icy and snowy terrain; heel crampons increase traction while traversing
  and descending</li><li> Recommended load specification for the Atlas 930 snowshoes
  includes weight of hiker with gear</li></ul>
