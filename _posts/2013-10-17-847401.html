description_list: <h4>Breaking the mold of sleeping bag shapes, the NEMO Nocturne
  30 sleeping bag brings up the notion that maybe mummies didn't sleep all that comfortably</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> NEMO finds a middle ground for the living</li><li> The
  new NEMO Spoon Shape is wide in the shoulders, tapers to hips and then gently flares
  back out to allow room for the natural bend and shift of knees</li><li> DownTek(TM)
  700-fill-power duck down repels water by employing nano technology and a proprietary
  process to apply a micro-thin polymer to the down</li><li> DownTek down repels water
  and maintains loft and insulation value, even in the wettest conditions</li><li>
  Proprietary application process creates a water repellent, antimicrobial and antibacterial
  down insulation that actually floats on water</li><li> A nifty little feature in
  the hood is the tuckable Blanket Fold(TM), an insulated flap of fabric that can
  be wrapped around neck to block drafts and add a layer of warmth</li><li> Baffle
  construction curves to the shape of your body; construction keeps down from shifting
  around, so cold spots are prevented</li><li> Waterproof/breathable coating on backside
  of fabric combined with a Durable Water Repelent on the exterior protects from tent
  wall condensation</li><li> NEMO Nocturne 30 down sleeping bag comes with a compression
  stuff sack and storage bag</li></ul>
