description_list: <h4>As the lighter, more nimble cousin to the Marker Duke bindings,
  the Marker Baron EPF randonee bindings have earned their stripes as a favorite among
  big-mountain backcountry skiers</h4><ul class="description"><li> New for this season,
  Extended Power Frame (EPF) design is 28% wider than the previous version of the
  Baron to increase power transmission to your fat powder skis</li><li> Switch between
  downhill and touring mode using the levers located under your boots; lever position
  eliminates the chance of accidentally switching to touring mode while skiing</li><li>
  DIN 4 - 13 adjustment lets hard-charging skiers stomp huge landings and hit high
  speeds without worrying about prereleasing</li><li> Climbing heel design offers
  3 positions-flat, 7deg and 13deg; positions can be easily adjusted using a ski pole</li><li>
  Gliding antifriction devices at the toes of the bindings are height adjustable to
  accommodate randonee and alpine boots</li><li> Low 36mm stand height creates a solid
  and secure connection to the ski</li><li> Included 110mm brakes fit wide skis and
  effectively stop runaway skis; brakes can be easily removed if desired</li><li>
  Heel design focuses power in direction of boot sole for superior holding power and
  energy transfer</li><li> Wide contact points efficiently transfer power to the skis</li><li>
  Marker Baron EPF randonee binding mounting configuration requires a minimum ski
  width of 89mm</li><li> Small size fits boot sole length of 265 - 325mm; large size
  fits boot sole length of 305 - 365mm</li></ul>
