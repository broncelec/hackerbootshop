description_list: '<h4>Use the CamelBak Stainless-Steel Groove(TM) Filter water bottle
  to turn your potable tap water into great-tasting water that you can enjoy while
  at home, in the office or on the go</h4><ul class="description"><li> Simply fill
  the bottle with tap water, screw the cap on and start sipping; the integrated plant-based
  carbon filter reduces chlorine taste and odors found in tap water</li><li> Filter
  is good for up to 3 mos</li><li> and is an easy way to enjoy tap water rather than
  purchasing disposable bottles of water</li><li> CamelBak Groove Filter bottle should
  be used to improve the taste of safe water sources only; filter does not remove
  viruses, bacteria or protozoa from water</li><li> Made of high-quality 18-8 stainless
  steel, the bottle is completely BPA-free; stainless steel stands up to regular use
  in the mountains or around town</li><li> Bypass the potential hazards of drinking
  from a wide opening-the CamelBak Groove bite valve virtually eliminates spills</li><li>
  Just bite and sip and the beverage flows through the valve-you don''t even need
  to tip the bottle to drink</li><li> Bite valve has an articulating stem, so when
  not in use it folds down next to the bottle and stays clean</li><li> Carry the CamelBak
  Stainless-Steel Groove Filter bottle via the integrated handle, or connect it to
  a pack or waistbelt with a small carabiner, not included</li><li> Please note: bottle
  is single walled and not intended for use with hot liquids</li></ul>'
