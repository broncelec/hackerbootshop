description_list: '<h4>Taking weight savings seriously, the Mavic Ksyrium SL S wheelset
  sheds grams while maintaining reliability and high-end performance</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  22mm deep front and 25mm deep rear rims are strengthened where the spokes exert
  the greatest stress; rear rim utilizes an asymmetric shape to enhance stiffness
  and durability</li><li> Lightweight yet strong proprietary aluminum rims have a
  drilling method that doesn''t penetrate the tube-facing wall, strengthening rim
  and eliminating the need for rim strips</li><li> Both rims feature a milled braking
  surface to improve friction; rim joints are welded and milled to eliminate shuddering
  during braking and provide superior wheel balance</li><li> Inter Spoke Milling 3D
  dramatically reduces material between spokes and along sides of rims, reducing weight
  and making them well-suited to climbing and fast acceleration</li><li> Rear hub
  features a lightweight and stiff aluminum hub body with pawls that are backed by
  stainless-steel inserts for reliable, strong engagement and power transfer</li><li>
  Both hubs boast a microadjustable system that lets you dial in bearing performance;
  double-sealed cartridge bearings deliver excellent longevity and smooth spinning</li><li>
  Lightweight double-butted straight-pull, bladed alloy spokes are laced radially
  on the front wheel; rear has radial lacing on the drive-side, 2-cross on the non-drive-side</li><li>
  Yksion Pro 700x23c clincher tires are included, offering front- and rear-specific
  performance for maximizing grip up front and minimizing rolling resistance in the
  back</li><li> Both tires have supple 127 tpi casings and are backed with a superior,
  puncture-resistant Kevlar(R) breaker; maximum recommended pressure of 130 psi (9
  bar)</li><li> Please note: tubes use Presta valves</li><li> The Mavic Kysrium SL
  S wheelset with tires comes with magnet (front wheel), quick-release skewers and
  a multifunction adjustment wrench</li><li> 100mm front and 130mm rear axle spacing</li></ul>'
