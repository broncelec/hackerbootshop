description_list: <h4>With years of research and development into them, the fully
  adjustable, well-cushioned Burton Custom snowboard bindings are all-mountain slayers
  that will take your performance to the next level</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Single-component, lightweight yet tough, polycarbonate baseplates create moderate
  flex and consistent response for a versatile ride on all terrain</li><li> Single-component,
  symmetric highbacks are responsive; minimized design saves precious weight, and
  they rotate to follow natural leg contours, optimizing comfort and power</li><li>
  Tool-free, forward-lean micro adjustment lets you dial in and lock forward your
  lean angle on the fly; forward lean adjusts independently of side-to-side rotation</li><li>
  Highbacks feature Over The Top padding for extra cushioning that won't bite your
  calves</li><li> FullBED cushioning covers the entire baseplate to maximize comfort
  and minimize fatigue; extendable toe ramps reduce toe drag and increase responsiveness</li><li>
  Primo Capstrap(TM) toe straps lock you into the bindings; lushly padded, precurved
  ankle straps feature telescoping and multi-location adjustability</li><li> Smooth
  Glide(TM) buckles are strong and easy to grab for quick closure and release</li><li>
  Burton Custom bindings are compatible with traditional 3D(TM), 4x4 bolt patterns
  and The Channel</li></ul>
