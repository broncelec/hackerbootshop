  CamelBak eddy(TM) insulated water bottle</h4><ul class="description"><li> Double-wall
  bottle features vacuum insulation to keep your drink cool all afternoon; insulation
  keeps condensation from forming on the outside of the bottle</li><li> Made of Eastman
  Tritan(TM) copolyester, the bottle is completely BPA-free and is dishwasher safe</li><li>
  Tritan copolyester provides excellent impact resistance and is suitable for both
  warm and cold beverages</li><li> CamelBak Big Bite valve eliminates awkward drips
  and spills; just bite and sip and the beverage flows through the valve-you don't
  even need to tip the bottle to drink</li><li> But if lifting and tipping is your
  preferred method, no problem; just remove the straw inside, tip and sip</li><li>
  Big Bite valve has an articulating stem, so when not in use it folds down next to
  the bottle and stays clean</li><li> Carry the integrated handle in the crook of
  a finger, or connect it to a pack or waistbelt with a small carabiner (sold separately)</li><li>
  Simply unscrew the cap to uncover bottle's wide-mouth opening for easy filling and
  cleaning; opening is compatible with standard 63mm caps, filters and accessories</li><li>

  carbonated beverages</li></ul>
