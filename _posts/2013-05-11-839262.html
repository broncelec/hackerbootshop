  width of 101mm; women-specific fit includes narrower heels, lower cuffs at the calves
  and higher insteps than comparable men's boots</li><li> Touring-style liners offer
  good range of motion yet provide support with stiff tongues</li><li> Tongue-style
  liners (as opposed to a wrap-style liners) provide easy entry and comfortable flex
  through the shins when touring</li><li> Cocona(R) lining helps move moisture and
  reduce odors; Cocona is made with fibers from activated carbon from coconut shells</li><li>
  See an REI ski shop professional to have the liners custom molded to your feet to
  maximize comfort and performance</li><li> Boots are compatible with all randonee
  bindings; tech fittings at the toes accept Dynafit-style bindings</li><li> Tech

  indicators can be seen from above to help you line the boot toes up with the bindings</li><li>
  3 Wiregate buckles and an instep strap on each boot close securely around your feet
  and legs; clasps hold buckles in place for quick transitions between uphill and
  downhill</li><li> Wide rip-and-stick power straps wrap securely around the outside
  of the cuffs, distributing pressure and bringing the cuffs as close as possible
  your lower legs</li><li> Rear ski/walk mechanisms free the cuffs for walking comfort;
  flip the switches to ski mode and you can lock the cuffs at 16deg or 20deg of forward
  lean</li><li> Scarpa Skadi randonee boots feature lugged Vibram soles for good grip
