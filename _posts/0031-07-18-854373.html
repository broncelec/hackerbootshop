<h3>The REI Havenpass jacket with eVent(TM) fabric is perfect for an epic climb to basecamp, alpine touring in a powder-filled bowl or pushing the pace on a snowshoe trek</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> eVent fabric has a unique membrane structure that allows sweat vapor to easily pass through the fabric; so you can go all out, yet stay drier and enjoy chill-free rest stops</li>
<li> eVent technology works so efficiently, no pit zippers are needed; all seams are sealed for complete waterproof protection; the shell is also windproof to 60+ mph</li>
<li> Embedded Recco(R) reflector enhances radio signals from search-and-rescue Recco detectors for quicker acquisition of position in the event of an avalanche</li>
<li> Helmet-compatible hood is adjustable to provide unhindered peripheral vision; drawcord system also snugs down to fit over your head alone</li>
<li> 2-way front zipper lets you adjust fit and venting; zipper is backed by a stormflap and topped by a chin guard</li>
<li> Adjustable hem drawcord and rip-and-stick cuff tabs let you fine-tune the fit</li>
<li> 2 zippered, mesh-lined front pockets are placed to clear hipbelt; 2 zippered, mesh-lined chest pockets can double as vents; 1 chest pocket has an inner cord port</li>
<li> The REI Havenpass jacket also has 2 inner stretch-mesh pockets that are large enough to comfortably hold climbing skins or other essentials</li>
<li> Note: To keep weight and bulkiness to a minimum, this backcountry jacket does not include a powder skirt</li>
<li> Care instructions: Machine wash warm with detergent (no fabric softener); rinse twice; a warm dryer will rejuvenate the Durable Water Repellent (DWR) finish</li>
</ul>
