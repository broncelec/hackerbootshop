<h3>The REI InCamp shelter is built with convertability and connections in mind</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> This strong, freestanding sun/weather shelter can be used on it's own or integrated to form an extended habitat</li>
<li> InCamp Shelter fits perfectly over the door end of the InCamp 4 tent (sold separately) creating both a patio for hanging out and a protected entryway</li>
<li> Add up to 4 REI Shelter Wing accessory panels (sold separately) to create a fully enclosed structure for privacy, wind and rain protection</li>
<li> REI InCamp shelter is easy to set up: hybrid steel/aluminum pre-bent poles with high-strength plastic hubs combine to form a durable frame</li>
<li> Near vertical walls provide areawide headroom for plenty of space to move around</li>
<li> Coated polyester taffeta canopy is waterproof (seam-sealed) and UV-resistant for years of service</li>
<li> Includes a zippered, duffel-style stuff sack, stakes, guylines and tighteners, pole repair tube, and pole and stake bags</li>
<li> REI Shelter Wing accessory panels (sold separately) can be poled out with the REI Adjustable Tarp Poles (sold separately) to create awnings</li>
<li> REI Shelter Wing accessory panels also allow the InCamp Shelter to integrate with vehicles and other tents</li>
</ul>
