description_list: <h4>The downhill-oriented Scarpa Gea RS randonee boots are designed
  for hard-charging female backcountry skiers</h4><ul class="description"><li> The
  RS boots are 20% stiffer and only a touch heavier than the original Gea boots</li><li>
  Polyamide shells and Pebax(R) tongues keep the boots light yet stiff for great responsiveness
  on fast descents</li><li> Shell design combines the best of both the overlap and
  cabrio constructions to allow easy entry/exit, excellent volume control and strong
  support for downhill performance</li><li> Touring-style Intuition Pro Flex RS liners
  use 100% Ultralon(R) foam for a custom fit; liners offer good range of motion yet
  provide support with stiff tongues</li><li> Tongue-style liners (as opposed to a
  wrap-style liners) provide easy entry and comfortable flex through the shins when
  touring</li><li> See an REI ski shop professional to have the liners custom molded
  to your feet to maximize comfort and performance</li><li> Boots are compatible with
  all randonee bindings; tech fittings at the toes accept Dynafit-style bindings</li><li>
  Tech fittings have grooves that make getting into Dynafit-style bindings easy; fitting
  indicators can be seen from above to help you line the boot toes up with the bindings</li><li>
  3 magnesium buckles and a Predator RS instep strap on each boot lock your feet in
  place; instep straps are easy to engage with gloves on</li><li> Wide rip-and-stick
  power straps wrap securely around the outside of the cuffs, distributing pressure
  and bringing the cuffs as close as possible your lower legs</li><li> Rear ski/walk
  mechanisms free the cuffs for walking comfort; flip the switches to ski mode and
  you can lock the cuffs at 16deg or 20deg of forward lean</li><li> Gea RS boots have
  a forefoot width of 101mm; women-specific fit includes narrower heels, lower cuffs
  at the calves and higher insteps than comparable men's boots</li><li> Scarpa Gea
  RS randonee boots feature lugged Vibram soles for good grip while hiking on rock
  and snow</li></ul>
