<li> Moisture-wicking polyester and polyolefin fabric features FlashDry(TM) microparticles embedded in the fabric to dramatically improve dry time and breathability</li>
<li> Made of crushed coconut shells and crushed volcanic rock, the FlashDry fabric additive leads to faster dry times and will not wash out</li>
<li> Flatlock seams; next-to-skin fit</li>
<li> Closeout</li>
