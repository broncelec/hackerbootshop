  of its insulating power even when dampened by rain, humidity or sweat, so you'll
  continue to stay warm</li><li> Small baffles in shell fabric allow insulation to
  fully expand to retain body heat; highly compressible ThermoBall insulation offers
  warmth equal to 600-fill-power goose down</li><li> Nylon taffeta shell features
  diamond stitching that helps hold insulation in place to keep it evenly distributed;
  Durable Water Repellent finish repels light moisture</li><li> Nylon taffeta lining
  wicks sweat off the skin for quick evaporation, helping you stay dry and comfortable</li><li>
  Quickly stuff the vest into its own space-saving, left-hand stow pocket for compact
  storage</li><li> The North Face ThermoBall vest for women features zippered hand
  pockets, elastic arm-hole bindings, drawcord hem and a reflective zipper pull</li></ul>
