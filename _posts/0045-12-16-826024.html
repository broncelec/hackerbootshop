<h3>The women's REI Kimtah jacket is perfect for spring and summer backpacking adventures</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> It's made with eVent(R) fabric and offers protection for activities where windy, wet weather is a concern</li>
<li> eVent fabric has a unique membrane structure that allows sweat vapor to quickly escape to the outside of the fabric</li>
<li> No matter how hard you work, overheating is unlikely due to this Direct Venting(TM) technology</li>
<li> And because you remain dry on the inside, the likelihood of an uncomfortable, post-exercise chill is eliminated</li>
<li> eVent technology works so efficiently, no pit zippers are needed; all seams are sealed for complete waterproof protection</li>
<li> Windproof to 60 mph</li>
<li> Fully adjustable brimmed hood features easy-to-use ripcord-style cinches</li>
<li> Includes a full-length, water-resistant front zipper with windflap and chin guard</li>
<li> Features adjustable hem drawcord and snow-resistant rip-and-stick cuff tabs; angled sleeves extend coverage over top of hands</li>
<li> Hand pockets with mesh lining are placed for easy access with a pack on; includes a zip sleeve pocket</li>
<li> Internal stow pocket features an earphone cord port</li>
<li> REI Kimtah jacket has an active fit that allows a full range of motion and enhances performance</li>
</ul>
