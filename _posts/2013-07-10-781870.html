description_list: <h4>The bent-shaft Kalliste paddle from Werner provides low-angle
  paddlers with premium materials, enhanced control and an exceptionally light and
  buoyant stroke</h4><ul class="description"><li> High-quality, continuous-weave carbon
  fiber shaft delivers a superior strength-to-weight ratio</li><li> Bent shaft naturally
  aligns wrists, providing immediate comfort and reducing strain; a special grip area
  that fits the natural contour of your hand increases overall control</li><li> Adjustable
  Ferrule System allows elegant adjustment of feathering angle from 0deg - 60deg right
  or left in 15deg increments</li><li> Improved ferrule design incorporates internal
  printing of offset degrees and a low-profile button release that makes paddle feel
  like 1 piece</li><li> Carbon fiber/foam core blades create a distinct profile that
  enters and exits the water quietly while adding buoyancy for a light stroke</li><li>
  Blade design with ribless back allows for a smooth sculling stroke; asymmetrical
  dihedral shape delivers flutter-free power and reduces fatigue</li><li> Midsize
  blades are designed with power and bracing in mind yet are surprisingly easy to
  pull through the water</li><li> Remarkably light swing weight reduces overall fatigue
  on long paddling excursions</li><li> Drip rings help keep hands and lap dry</li><li>
  2-piece design breaks down quickly and eases transport and storage</li></ul>
