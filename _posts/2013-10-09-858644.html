description_list: <h4>The Dynafit Vulcan TF randonee boots offer climbing agility
  without compromising performance on the descent</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  They can drive modern freeride skis at any speed and stand up to landing big drops</li><li>
  Grilamid(R) shells and carbon fiber/Grilamid cuffs provide outstanding stiffness
  for fast descents and excellent weight savings on long backcountry tours</li><li>
  Comfortable, custom thermal-formable liners are premolded on anatomic lasts for
  use right out of the box; liner instep areas are low volume for responsive ski performance</li><li>
  Roomy toe areas in the liners allow good circulation so your toes stay warm; abrasion-resistant
  external fabric ensures the liners will stand up to regular use</li><li> Liners
  are not likely to require custom thermal-forming, but they can be molded to your
  feet by a qualified ski-shop employee</li><li> Cuff and central buckle retention
  system prevents unwanted release; retention system maintains the desired tension
  so you don't have to make adjustments before skiing down</li><li> Rear spoilers
  slide inside the cuffs, allowing the widest and smoothest cuff rotation possible;
  spoilers alleviate friction between cuffs and liners</li><li> 3mm-thick polyethylene
  layer in the shell provides adequate insulation to help keep your feet warm</li><li>
  The ski/walk mechanisms can be set between 15deg and 18deg of forward lean, as well
  as loosened for walking</li><li> Insert the included Downhill Booster tongues on
  the descent for added support, then remove them on the way back up greater comfort
  and agility</li><li> Power straps help close the boots securely around your legs;
  straps can be removed from the rear cuffs and fixed to the Booster tongues to help
  you keep track of the tongues</li><li> Soles feature a mix of soft, medium and hard
  rubber compounds for excellent grip when hiking and compression resistance when
  skiing</li><li> Soles are compatible with all randonee bindings</li></ul>
