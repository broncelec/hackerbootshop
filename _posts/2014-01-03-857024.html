description_list: <h4>The Jones Mothership snowboard is a women-specific, high-performance
  freeride board that can take you down the steepest slopes with the deepest pow</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> This board is truly a freerider's dream</li><li> Mellow
  Magne-Traction keeps the board solid on ice; a blunt nose, directional rocker and
  camber underfoot deliver the float and stability needed for bombing any line, any
  time</li><li> Directional rocker features more tip rocker than tail rocker and a
  slight camber between feet; rockered tip adds float and improves maneuverability</li><li>
  Blunt nose offers the float of a much longer board tip without the added length
  or swing weight; slightly rockered tail maintains power and stability when initiating
  turns</li><li> Mellow Magne-Traction improves edge grip by adding five contact points
  along the running length of the board, resulting in amazing control whether riding
  ice or pow</li><li> Full wood core is comfortable and robust; it's a true all-terrain
  core and certified by the Forest Stewardship Council</li><li> Ash-wood topsheet
  provides a lively but damp board feel that's big on pop and solid on landings; carbon
  stringers improve pop and torsional stiffness</li><li> Steel edges; sintered base,
  with recycled P-tex scraps, absorbs wax fast and retains the wax longer; carbon
  nano particles and other additives enhance glide</li><li> P-tex waste is drastically
  reduced by flip-flopping base graphic colors between boards; base colors are random,
  thus specific requests cannot be accommodated</li><li> </li></ul>
