<li> Supportive fabric and back-of-the-knee mesh panels keep hard-working muscles comfortable when it's go time</li>
<li> Fabric protects skin from the sun with a UPF rating of 15</li>
<li> Mesh panels placed over high-heat areas enhance ventilation</li>
<li> Silver-salt treatment at gusset fights odors so you don't have to worry about funky capris</li>
<li> Elastic waist with drawstring ensures a comfortable fit</li>
<li> Need to stash some extra fuel for that last mile? A rear zipperless pocket stores a key, card and energy food using 2 separate mesh compartments</li>
<li> Simply separate the exterior and interior elastic mesh layers and insert contents, then fold the exterior layer over the interior to lock items in place</li>
<li> A pocket at the side of capris is designed specifically to hold an energy gel</li>
