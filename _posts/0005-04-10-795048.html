<h3>Built for the growing young backpacker, the 3-season REI Nodder kids' synthetic sleeping bag is light and compressible while balancing price and performance for years of use</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> This bag is built to the same insulation standard as the EN-rated REI Polar Pod +25degF adult sleeping bag</li>
<li> Attached stuff sack doubles as a space adjuster allowing you to shorten or lengthen the bag as child grows</li>
<li> Close-fitting hood with a stretchy opening around face allows an auto-adjust, kid-friendly fit</li>
<li> Dual side zips combined with rip-and-stick closure tabs allow room for arms to be free for games or reading while inside bag</li>
<li> Shingle construction with overlapping layers eliminates cold spots; evenly distributed insulation accomodates the multi-position sleeper</li>
<li> Special pocket in hood can be stuffed with clothing layers to make a pillow that stays in place; no need for a pillow to take up valuable space in your backpack</li>
<li> Synthetic polyester insulation is durable and retains some insulating properties even when wet</li>
<li> Ripstop nylon shell fabric has a nice hand feel, is lightweight, durable, water- and abrasion resistant; nylon taffeta lining is soft and tear-resistant</li>
<li> Both zippers feature full-length draft tubes to keep heat in and cold out</li>
<li> Pad loop attachment points keep your sleeping bag and pad together, so you needn't worry about rolling onto the cold ground (straps sold separately)</li>
<li> Ideal for 6 - 10 year olds</li>
</ul>
