description_list: '<h4>The Nemo Rhythm 25 sleeping bag brings up the notion that maybe
  mummies didn''t sleep all that comfortably</h4><ul class="description"><li> Nemo
  finds a middle ground for the living and breaks the mold of sleeping bag shapes</li><li>
  The new Nemo Spoon Shape is wide in the shoulders, tapers to hips and then gently
  flares back out to allow room for the natural bend and shift of knees</li><li> PrimaLoft(R)
  Synergy synthetic microfiber insulation works a lot like down: it minimizes bulkiness,
  packs down well and stays warm even when wet</li><li> Underside of sleeping bag
  features 10% less insulation than the topside to cut down on weight; insulation
  underneath is often flattened, thus less doesn''t hinder performance</li><li> Waterproof/breathable
  coating on backside of fabric combined with a Durable Water Repellent on the exterior
  protects from tent wall condensation</li><li> A nifty little feature in the hood
  is the tuckable Blanket Fold(TM), an insulated flap of fabric that can be wrapped
  around neck to block drafts and add a layer of warmth</li><li> NEMO Rhythm 25 sleeping
  bag comes with a compression stuff sack and storage bag</li></ul>'
