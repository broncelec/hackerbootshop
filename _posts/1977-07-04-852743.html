<h3>An all-around alpine glove for skiing, mountaineering and other snowy adventures, the waterproof, insulated Montana gloves from The North Face protect your hands from the elements</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> HyVent waterproof, breathable inserts keep moisture from getting inside</li>
<li> Heatseeker(TM) polyester fiber insulation at the palms and backs of hands keeps you toasty warm on cold days</li>
<li> Removable wrist wraps inside the gloves are designed to hold hand warmer packets (sold separately) to warm blood as it flows to your hands</li>
<li> 5 Dimensional Fit(TM) uses 5 measurements of the hand to construct gloves with an accurate and consistent fit</li>
<li> Radiametric Articulation(TM) improves warmth and blood flow to your fingers by mirroring the natural relaxed curve of the hand</li>
<li> Grippy polyurethane palms help you hold onto ski poles and other gear</li>
<li> Cinch the gaskets at the cuffs on The North Face Montana gloves to lock out winter weather</li>
</ul>
