<h3>The North Face Torpedo jacket for women is the perfect solution to conserve core heat when the air outside has a not-so-welcome chill</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Polyester fabric on front and back create a barrier against wind and light rain; polyester mesh maximizes breathability</li>
<li> Durable Water Repellent finish helps light precipitation bead up and roll off, and jacket protects skin from too much UV light with a UPF rating of 50+</li>
<li> Zip hand pockets offer plenty of space to stash all the things you need for your workout; reach around to the rear lower-back pocket from either side to stash additional items</li>
<li> Hem is slightly dropped in back to enhance coverage, and a cinch cord tightens up jacket around waist to keep out chills</li>
<li> Reflective piping and logos help increase your visibility in dim light</li>
<li> The women's Torpedo jacket from The North Face offers a fit that stays with the body without being restrictive</li>
</ul>
