<h3>The North Face Darkwind Shell jacket for men is two-faced, but we mean that in a good way</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Wind-resistant front and highly breathable back work to ensure comfort when climbing with a pack</li>
<li> Tightly woven recycled polyester with a Durable Water Repellent finish blocks wind and sheds water</li>
<li> TNF(R) Apex Aerobic fabric on back promotes breathability in the areas a pack normally covers; additional DWR finish fends off rain when worn alone</li>
<li> 2 zippered front pockets are pack and harness compatible</li>
<li> The North Face Darkwind Shell jacket features a hidden cinch cord accessed via the pockets for a snug, personalized fit</li>
<li> Closeout</li>
</ul>
