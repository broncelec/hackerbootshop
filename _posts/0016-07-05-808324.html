<ul class="description">
<li> It's perfectly sized for kids ages 5 - 8</li>
<li> FreeFlow sculpted back panel reduces sweaty contact areas with peaks and valleys that let vapor escape; soft foam allows the pack to conform to kids' backs for a stable fit</li>
<li> Webbing hipbelt can be tucked away into its own pocket when not in use</li>
<li> Panel loading main compartment is easy to organize and access; hydration pocket fits a 50 fl</li>
<li> oz</li>
<li> hydration reservoir (sold separately)</li>
<li> Elastic cord on the front provides a spot to stash a jacket and helps compress the pack body; mesh side pockets hold water bottles and afternoon snacks</li>
<li> Safety whistle is built into the sternum strap buckle so a child need never be without this 10 essentials item</li>
<li> The REI Sprig 12 pack is designed to keep the load close to the body for stability</li>
</ul>
