description_list: '<h4>The Obi 2P Tent is the black belt martial artist of the NEMO
  lineup</h4><ul class="description"><li> It''s a finely tuned instrument, with not
  1 oz of material wasted</li><li> Every feature and detail is driven by purpose and
  strategy</li><li> Subtly moving the front pole hub overhead gives the pole skeleton
  shoulders, creating more interior volume without the need for an additional ridge
  pole</li><li> Raised waterproof tub floor allows fly cutouts, which save significant
  weight and improve ventilation</li><li> Separate side vestibules and entrances on
  Obi 2P eliminate jostling for position and provide individual gear storage areas</li><li>
  You and a friend can enjoy 27 sq</li><li> ft</li><li> of interior space at only
  3 lbs</li><li> Hubbed pole intersections create a single-corded pole for quick setup;
  it also allows a free-standing support and minimizes total pole weight</li><li>
  Configure vestibules fully opened, closed or partially deployed depending on the
  weather</li><li> Lightweight and strong DAC(R) NSL pole system with press-fit connectors
  and lightweight hubs are finished using an anodization process free of harsh acids</li><li>
  DAC pole clips are easy to use and more durable than standard pole clips</li><li>
  DAC Jake''s Foot(R) corner anchors make setup fast and easy; when the fly is attached,
  they act as cantilevers pulling the corners of the inner tent close to the ground</li><li>
  Jake''s Foot corners also let you set up the fly and poles without the inner tent
  to create an ultralight shade or shelter; optional footprint for this setup is sold
  separately</li><li> Combination of venting options in the Nemo Obi 2 helps promote
  good air circulation</li><li> Includes reflective guyouts, inside mesh pockets and
  a light-diffusing headlamp pocket</li><li> Included accessories: dry-bag style stuff
  sack, stakes/guyline, pole repair sleeve and repair kit</li></ul>'
