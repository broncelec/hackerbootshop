description_list: <h4>Comfortable during the hike and powerful on the descent, the
  Salomon Quest 120 ski boots help you access the best part of the resort</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> Specialized ski/hike mechanism frees the upper cuff from
  the lower part of the boot and offers enough movement to comfortably hike to untouched
  stashes</li><li> When you're ready to ski, the cuffs lock directly into the lower
  shells to maximize power transmission on the descent</li><li> Innovative V-shaped
  lower shells and magnesium backbones virtually eliminate flex when backbones are
  engaged</li><li> Waterproof fabric along the sides of the tongues helps keep feet
  dry, even when hiking in deep powder</li><li> Customfit Pro liners conform under
  feet, over insteps and around toes, heels, Achilles and shins for superior foothold</li><li>
  Liners may be custom molded to enhance fit</li><li> Moisture-wicking layers of mesh,
  foam and insulation in liners efficiently transfer chilling sweat away from feet</li><li>
  Liners disperse more moisture than standard liners, helping keep feet dry and warm</li><li>
  Quicklace liner system creates an even pressure distribution around foot, and neoprene
  toe boxes absorb shock and increases insulation</li><li> Cushioning in the tongues
  reduces shin bang, and closed-cell foam under boot boards softens hard landings</li><li>
  Adjustable spoiler features 3 positions to personalize the fit around your calves
  and increase forward lean</li><li> Single canting sets cuffs to a different forward
  lean angles depending on how aggressively you ski</li><li> Rubber soles offer excellent
  traction on slippery surfaces</li><li> With a flex index of 120, Salomon Quest 120
  ski boots provide the responsive power transfer preferred by expert skiers</li></ul>
