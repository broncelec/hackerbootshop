<h3>The REI Endeavor pants have just about every detail you'd want in a cool-weather hiking pant</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> The quick-drying fabric is durable, wind- and water-resistant, and stretches so you can move comfortably</li>
<li> Double-weave polyester/spandex fabric provides 4-way stretch for excellent range of motion and comfort while climbing and hiking; fabric resists abrasion</li>
<li> Fabric is wind resistant up to 30 mph and has a Durable Water Repellent coating to help shed moisture</li>
<li> With a UPF 50+ rating, fabric provides excellent protection against harmful ultraviolet rays</li>
<li> Zip fly, snap closure and bonded belt loops; polyester tricot lines the waistband to wick sweat and enhance comfort next to skin</li>
<li> Internal waistband cord cleat allows you to dial in the fit at the waist with one hand</li>
<li> Crotch gusset extends comfort and range of motion</li>
<li> Side seam shaping and knee darts create leg articulation for more comfortable movement</li>
<li> Zippered hems with rip-and-stick tabs allow pants to adjust around boots; ankle scuff guards are bonded rather than sewn for enhanced durability</li>
<li> 2 low-profile hand pockets, a welded zip leg pocket and 2 rear pockets give you space to stow some essentials</li>
<li> REI Endeavor pants have a classic fit that's cut just right for easy wearing</li>
</ul>
