  and fully-adjustable highbacks that dial-in stance, it's no wonder Burton Mission
  snowboard bindings are an all-mountain favorite</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Re:Flex minimized, cored baseplates dramatically improve board flex and feel, reduce
  weight and allow a variety of cushioning options</li><li> Short-glass fiber/nylon
  baseplates feature gapless EVA toe and heel pads; adjustable toe ramps reduce toe
  drag and increase responsiveness</li><li> FullBED(TM) cushioning covers the entire
  baseplate, and shock-absorbent damping pads eat up vibrations, sudden impacts and
  rough terrain so you don't have to</li><li> Canted Living Hinge(TM) Zero-Lean highbacks

  aggressive stance</li><li> Superstrap(TM) ankle straps feature precurved spines
  molded to match the shape of your feet and ankles; gel padding dials in comfort</li><li>
  Gettagrip capstrap toe straps feature a slim, 3D design; rubber material grips boot
  toes for a secure, locked-down fit</li><li> Smooth Glide(TM) buckles deliver buttery-smooth
  and reliable ratcheting power season after season</li><li> Burton Mission bindings
