  ski-to-binding holding strength</li><li> Patented SpeedSkinFix attachment system

  system does not interfere with the attachment of other brands of skins that feature
  a tip loop and tail clip</li><li> Dynafit Baltoro skis have a sintered graphite
  coating on the bases that enhances glide and improves wax retention</li><li> Base
