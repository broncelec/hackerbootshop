description_list: '<h4>Are you addicted to speed-filled, big-mountain runs? With a
  stiff flex, quick lacing and cushioned liners, the Burton Driver-X boots provide
  superior response and comfort on your hard-charging days</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Not stiff enough? Add torque to the tongues with Rider Adjustable Flex tongue inserts:
  they personalize forward flex, increasing both response and boot life</li><li> Firm-flexing,
  thin-profile, 3D molded tongues wrap the shins, ankles and insteps in comfort, offer
  a seamless flex and reduce performance-robbing shell/liner stack-up</li><li> Snowproof
  internal gussets on boot tongues completely seal lower boot zones to keep feet warm
  and dry</li><li> Streamlined Speed Zone(TM) shell lacing lets you fine-tune the
  upper and lower zones in seconds; this system offers powerful rebound, wrap and
  response with minimal effort</li><li> To make entry and exit easy, Burton added
  a pull loop on the tongue as well as a lace pull tab that releases both the upper
  and lower zones simultaneously</li><li> Imprint(TM) 3X liners with Focus Cuffs ride
  high on the ankles for increased agility and response; liners have rip-and-stick
  closures, ankle-hugging J-bars and lace locks</li><li> Liners provide a consistent
  flex over time and slide on and off feet easily; precurved ankle panels reduce lace
  pressure on front of legs</li><li> Molded EVA footbeds with a supportive shank lessen
  the blow of hardpack landings; antimicrobial coating fights odors</li><li> B3 gel
  heel inserts provide ultimate damping and are formulated to withstand repeated impacts
  without breaking down</li><li> Vibram(R) EcoStep(TM) outsoles are made with recycled
  rubber and backed by nearly 70 years of mountaineering knowledge for superior traction,
  feel and light weight</li><li> Dual-density grippy rubber spikes dig into ice to
  help prevent slippage when off your board; durable toe material helps binding toe
  straps stay in place</li><li> Shrinkage(TM) technology reduces boot''s overall footprint
  by 1 full size, minimizing boot overhang, bulk and weight</li></ul>'
