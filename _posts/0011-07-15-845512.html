<h3>Built for the growing young camper, the REI Kindercone kid's sleeping bag keeps your little one warm while enjoying backyard campouts or camping sessions in the woods</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Attached stuff sack doubles as a space adjuster allowing you to shorten or lengthen the bag as child grows</li>
<li> Mummy bag features a barrel shape that provides generous interior volume for move-around comfort</li>
<li> Ripstop nylon shell fabric has a nice hand feel, and is lightweight, durable, water- and abrasion resistant</li>
<li> Synthetic insulation provides toasty warmth and continues to insulate even when damp</li>
<li> Soft and comfortable polyester taffeta liner features bright, fun graphics</li>
<li> 2-way, antisnag coil zipper; differentiated drawcords (1 round, 1 flat) allow quick identification, even in the dark, so neck and hood adjustments are a cinch</li>
<li> REI Kindercone has a pillow pocket in the hood so kids can stuff extra clothing inside for a comfortable pillow</li>
</ul>
