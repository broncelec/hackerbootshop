description_list: <h4>Built to keep your feet warm and comfortable, the women's Nordica
  Cruise 65 ski boots are a great choice for fun on the mountain this season</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> As compared to men's liners, women-specific liners feature
  extra padding in the tongues, more insulation throughout and contoured top edges
  designed to fit women's calves</li><li> Dual-density plastic maximizes ease of entry
  regardless of temperature; even if you have high insteps, getting your foot in the
  boot is hassle free</li><li> Soft shell flaps make it easy to get your foot in the
  boot; no more standing on 1 foot, hunching over, forcing your instep between 2 unforgiving,
  pinching plastic flaps</li><li> Liners snugly wrap the feet in cushioning foam and
  warm fleece lining; closed-cell foam against the shell enhances warmth</li><li>
  Liners provide a personalized fit around heel, ankle and center of foot when custom
  molded</li><li> Footbeds optimize foot position to create an effortless skiing stance,
  and they offer easy support for comfortable wear all day long</li><li> Upper buckle
  features a ladder that changes position to ease closure of the top portion of the
  boot; ladder changes position without the use of tools</li><li> Top of the boot
  a little tight? Cuffs feature an adjustable hex nut that increases the circumference
  of the top of the boot by 3 - 5mm and relaxes the angle of the boots</li><li> Power
  straps adjust cuffs for snugness and pressure against the shins</li><li> With a
  flex index of 65, Nordica Cruise 65 ski boots provide light resistance against a
  forward lean, appropriate for most recreational skiers</li><li> Extra-wide last
  accommodates forefoot measurements up to 104mm</li></ul>
