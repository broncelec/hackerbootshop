description_list: <h4>Originally designed for caving, the Stop Descender is a device
  that stops or considerably slows descent when the handle is released</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Locking mechanism can be disabled with a carabiner when a hand is needed to negotiate
  a drop</li><li> Handle is squeezed to descend normally, controlling speed with the
  other hand; slack rope can easily be taken up</li><li> All control surfaces are
  stainless steel</li><li> Works best with clean, flexible rope, stiff rope may result
  in greatly impaired or reduced friction and the stop feature may be inoperative</li></ul>
