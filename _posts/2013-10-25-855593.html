description_list: '<h4>Lightweight, highly adjustable and easy to get in and out of,
  these Time Xpresso 8 Carbon bike pedals deliver excellent performance for your demanding
  road-riding exploits</h4><ul class="description"><li> Instead of metal springs,
  flexible carbon fiber blades tension the retention mechanisms, ensuring a secure
  pedal connection while reducing weight</li><li> Getting into the pedals is a breeze,

  pressure, pedal engages cleat, and then pedal away! Oversize pedal platform and

  and excellent foot-to-pedal stability</li><li> Carbon fiber-reinforced composite
  pedal bodies spin smoothly around sturdy and light hollow steel axles; replaceable
  stainless-steel wear plates enhance pedal durability</li><li> Foot/pedal interface
  can be tuned and optimized, offering adjustment to Q-factor (side-to-side), +/-5deg
  of angular float and 2</li><li>5mm of lateral float; 15deg release angle</li><li>
