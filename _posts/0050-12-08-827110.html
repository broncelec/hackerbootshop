<h3>With the REI Flash 18 pack, versatility is the name of the game</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> For use in your larger backpack or duffel, this lightweight daypack cleverly converts into a stuff sack simply by turning inside out! Turn inside out and it's a stuff sack to help organize your gear; once at basecamp, reverse it and use as a daypack for short hikes away from camp</li>
<li> Removable back panel pad doubles as a sit pad; removable hipbelt and sternum strap make the pack customizable for different uses</li>
<li> Interior zippered pocket secures keys and other small items</li>
<li> Hydration-compatible design has an hose exit port and an internal sleeve to hold a hydration reservoir, sold separately</li>
<li> Top-loading entry features an efficient, single drawcord that cinches skirt closed with single tug; small flap covers the opening when cinched closed</li>
<li> Front of pack features twin daisy chains running vertically and a tool loop at the bottom for attaching items on the front of the pack</li>
<li> 140-denier ripstop nylon increases durability without adding weight; polyurethane coating offers weather resistance</li>
</ul>
