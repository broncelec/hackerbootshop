description_list: <h4>Whether you're reading a map or searching for a trail, the built-in
  light sensor in the Petzl Tikka(R) R+ headlamp automatically adjusts beam pattern
  and light output, leaving your hands free</h4><ul class="description"><li> When
  you're looking at an object at very close range, such as a map or piece of equipment,
  the Reactive sensor adjusts the light to a very wide beam with low output</li><li>
  As you make your way down the trail, the beam widens and adjusts to a medium light
  output in order to illuminate objects in the path</li><li> If you raise your head
  to see something in the distance, such as a trail marker or rappel anchor, the beam
  becomes focused and the light intensity increases</li><li> Reactive lighting keeps
  your hands free longer because you don't need to press a button to adjust light
  output; it also extends battery life by efficiently using power</li><li> Download
  OS by Petzl software to modify the functionality of your R+ headlamp; you can adjust
  light intensity, burn time and distance according to an activity</li><li> Create
  custom activity profiles or select from pre-configured profiles such as trail running,
  mountaineering and hiking; load these onto the R+ and you're ready to go</li><li>
  OS by Petzl software is available for download from Petzl at www</li><li>petzl</li><li>com/OS</li><li>
  Headlamp can also be operated in constant mode, which disables the sensor and gives
  you standard high, medium and low output settings</li><li> LED shines light 2 -
  65m and outputs 7 - 170 lumens on high Reactive mode, 2 - 55m and 7 - 130 lumens
  on medium Reactive and 2 - 40m and 7 - 70 lumens on low Reactive mode</li><li> In
  constant mode, LED throws light 50m and outputs 120 lumens on high, 40m and 80 lumens
  on medium and 30m and 40 lumens on low</li><li> Red LED positioned to the side of
  the white LED helps preserve your night vision; use the headlamp as a blinking light
  to increase your chance of being seen in urban environs</li></ul>
