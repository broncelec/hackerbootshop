description_list: <h4>Strap on the intermediate-level Salomon Quest 90 ski boots,
  flip the switch to "hike" and go find untracked powder</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Specialized ski/hike mechanism frees the upper cuff from the lower part of the boot
  and offers enough movement for comfortable hikes to untouched stashes</li><li> When
  you're ready to ski, the cuffs lock directly into the lower shells to maximize power
  transmission on the descent</li><li> Innovative V-shaped lower shell and magnesium
  backbone virtually eliminate flex when backbone is engaged</li><li> Waterproof gussets
  along the sides of the tongues help keep feet dry, even when hiking in deep powder</li><li>
  Comfortable liners feature a layer of custom-moldable foam that personalizes the
  fit around the shins</li><li> Liners disperse more moisture than standard liners;
  they feature wicking layers of mesh, foam and insulation to transfer sweat away
  from feet to keep them dry and warm</li><li> Closed-cell foam under the boot boards
  softens hard landings</li><li> With a medium flex index of 90, Salomon Quest 90
  ski boots offer the responsive flex preferred by intermediate skiers</li></ul>
