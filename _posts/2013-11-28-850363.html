  C</li><li>A</li><li>M</li><li>P</li><li> USA Tricam Evo can be placed in 3 different
  positions (1 active cam and 2 passive chock), making it more likely to fit perfectly
  in various cracks</li><li> Tapered shape of the Tricam Evo allows you to place it
  in 2 passive chock positions, whereas earlier versions of the Tricam only allow
  1 passive chock position</li><li> The wider section at the top of the head of the
  Tricam that creates the taper also lends additional stability when the Tricam is
  used in cammed placements</li><li> Tricam Evo is an excellent piece of gear for
  protecting horizontal and vertical cracks, whether they're parallel-sided or slightly
  flaring</li><li> Stiff sewing keeps the nylon sling more rigid than on previous
  versions of the Tricam to make 1-handed placement and extraction easier</li><li>
  1</li><li>5 size has a range of 27 - 40mm and weighs 57g</li></ul>
