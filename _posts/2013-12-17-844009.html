description_list: <h4>Combining single-stem flexibility for horizontal crack placements
  with a narrow head width that fits in tight places, the Black Diamond Camalot X4
  cam is the missing link on your trad rack</h4><ul class="description"><li> X4 features
  4 cam lobes for excellent expansion range and holding power, yet it maintains a
  narrow width so it can fit where other cams won't, such as in old piton scars</li><li>
  Narrow head width is created by embedding the cam springs within the cam lobes</li><li>
  Stacked axle design of the smallest three sizes gives the cams more expansion range
  per size than any other small four-cam unit available</li><li> Largest three sizes
  use the tried-and-true Black Diamond double axle design that's found in the original
  Camalot</li><li> Six sizes of the X4 cover the same expansion range as eight sizes
  of comparable cam units, meaning you can carry fewer cams yet protect the same size
  cracks</li><li> Aluminum beads protect the woven cable from abrasion without compromising
  the flexibility of the stem, allowing the cam to hold strong in awkward horizontal
  placements</li><li> Trigger bar is hot forged to fit comfortably in your hand and
  make cam placement quick and easy</li><li> Lightweight, durable Dyneema slings help
  you identify the cam you want when you're grabbing one; Dyneema slings visually
  set the cams apart from others on your rack</li><li> Color-coded Oz and Neutrino
  carabiner Rackpacks are sold separately, offering a great way to rack the Black
  Diamond Camalot X4 cams for easy identification</li></ul>
