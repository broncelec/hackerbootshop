description_list: <h4>With stable-yet-playful 96mm waists, rockered tips and tails
  and lightweight construction, the Salomon Q-96 Lumen women's skis roam from groomed
  runs to off-piste terrain with smooth versatility</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Rockered profile excels in soft snow and delivers fluid performance on hardpack;
  when put on edge, 95% of edge length contacts the snow for precision on groomed
  runs</li><li> Full wood core delivers direct transmission of power with precision
  and efficiency, and a specialized construction enhances edge-to-edge response to
  boost maneuverability</li><li> Elastomer inserts placed over the edges absorb vibrations,
  resulting in a smooth ride that softens ski-to-snow contact</li><li> Tips feature
  a honeycomb structure that reduces weight and makes it easier to rotate skis</li><li>
  Fiber reinforcements laid directly on the edges add torsional rigidity and improve
  edge durability, and wide metal edges withstand big impacts and improve shock resistance</li><li>
  The Salomon Q-96 Lumen women's skis require bindings with wide brakes</li><li> Base
  or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
