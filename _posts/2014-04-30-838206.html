description_list: <h4>The Atlas Elektra 927 snowshoes feature a women-specific design
  to ensure comfort and efficiency when strolling across snowscapes</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Women-specific, V-shaped frames are made from sturdy 6061 aluminum and are designed
  to facilitate a woman's natural stride</li><li> Nose and tail shapes are optimized
  to provide a balanced platform for stable footing and facilitate an easy, natural
  stride</li><li> Free-Rotating(TM) Suspension lets the binding rotate much farther
  forward than previous Atlas designs, freeing up the stride and reducing the amount
  of tail flip</li><li> The result of the design is that freedom of movement is increased,
  the toe crampon can bite into snow better and the foot is allowed a more natural
  rotation</li><li> Wrapp(TM) Trail bindings use a continuous webbing design that
  tightens snugly with a single pull; bindings also cradle feet and arches for a secure,
  comfortable fit</li><li> Abrasion-resistant, lightweight Nytex(TM) nylon decks stay
  flexible when cold and stand up to the elements for lasting use</li><li> Steel toe
  crampons supply sure-footed traction on icy and snowy terrain; heel crampons increase
  traction while traversing and descending</li><li> Recommended load specification
  for the Atlas Elektra 927 snowshoes includes weight of hiker with gear</li></ul>
