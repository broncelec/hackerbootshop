description_list: '<h4>When riding outside isn''t an option, the CycleOps Wind Bike
  Trainer offers simple, progressive resistance at a great value</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Fan blades on flywheel use surrounding air as natural resistance; weight of flywheel
  also offers smooth starts and slow-downs, offering a road-like feel</li><li> Sturdy
  trainer frame features folding legs for compact storage or transportation</li><li>
  Bike mounts to the trainer by way of a bolt-action locking mechanism that clamps
  around an included quick-release skewer, enabling a secure, stable connection to
  the trainer</li><li> Please note: because the resistance unit of the CycleOps Wind
  Bike Trainer is a fan, a higher level of noise is normal</li><li> Updated frame
  works with all standard wheels and now works with 29er mountain bike wheels (fits
  most treads to 2</li><li>25 in</li><li>)</li></ul>'
