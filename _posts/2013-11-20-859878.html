description_list: <h4>The Voile V8 backcountry skis have wide tips and narrow tails
  for lots of float in powder, while the tight sidecut radius and short running length
  keep them playful and easy to control when carving</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Lightweight construction makes the V8 skis a good choice for long tours; aspen wood
  cores are wrapped in fiberglass that is woven with carbon for a light, snappy feel</li><li>
  Wide 146mm tips and 115mm waists (186cm ski) provide ample flotation in soft snow,
  while the large sidecut and short turning radius keep them fun on harder snow</li><li>
  Early-rise tips help you float through the deep powder on the descent and ease trail
  breaking in deep snow during the ascent</li><li> Tails of the skis turn up just
  a touch and are compatible with the tail attachments of most climbing skins (sold
  separately)</li><li> Traditional sidecut underfoot lets you carve turns on firm
  snow as you make your way out of the woods</li><li> Voile V8 skis have sintered
  bases that retain wax well and provide good glide</li><li> Base or topsheet color
  may vary from online photo</li></ul>
