<h3>A warm, wicking base layer like the REI Midweight Polartec(R) Power Dry(R) Half Zip top in men's tall sizes can make the difference between cold-weather trips to remember and those to forget</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Sleeves are 1</li>
<li>5 in</li>
<li> longer and hem is 2 in</li>
<li> longer than regular Midweight Polartec Power Half-Zip top</li>
<li> Polartec Power Dry utilizes 2 different yarns on either side of the fabric to enhance comfort: interior yarn wicks moisture, and exterior yarn dries quickly</li>
<li> Combination of the 2 yarns helps keep you dry during highly aerobic activities because it moves moisture away from skin faster than single-component fabrics such as cotton</li>
<li> Fabric offers UPF rating of 20 to protect against harmful UV light</li>
<li> Center front zipper allows ventilation control</li>
<li> Flatseam construction is soft and non-chafing next to skin, and raglan seams are designed to be comfortable when wearing pack straps on your shoulders</li>
<li> Underarm and side gussets promote freedom of motion and reduce chafing under a hipbelt</li>
<li> Longer length helps top stay tucked in, and smooth texture of outer surface helps it slide easily under extra layers</li>
<li> The men's REI Midweight Polartec Power Dry Half Zip top in tall sizes features a next-to-skin fit that hugs the body</li>
</ul>
