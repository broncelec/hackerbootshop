description_list: '<h4>The REI Arete ASL (All Season Light) 2 tent fills the gap between
  the limited seasonality of ultralight tents and the robustness of 4-season tents</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> High-strength pole architecture, lightweight materials,
  fully sealable interior and roomy floor plan combine to create a low-weight, weather-worthy
  tent</li><li> 3-pole extended dome structure is designed for strength; compact footprint
  and single front vestibule are ideal for setups in tight spots</li><li> Asymmetrical
  shape keeps the weight low while allowing an efficient use of interior space; it
  provides nice roominess around the shoulder area</li><li> Large, multidiameter DAC
  Featherlight(R) NSL Combi poles increase interior volume and structural stability</li><li>
  Dual AirLift rainfly vents channel wind to increase tent''s strength; fully adjustable,
  these ceiling vents create cross-flow ventilation that mitigates condensation</li><li>
  Dead End pole sleeves and color coding facilitate a quick setup</li><li> Speed-pitching
  option allows tent and fly to be semi-permanently attached for a quick setup that
  protects the canopy from precipitation</li><li> Arete can be used in a variety of
  seasons and climates: inner tent is fully closeable, with zippered panels that cover
  the mesh doors and vents</li><li> Hybrid floor combines sealed seams and bathtub
  curves to create a waterproof, taut floor; tautness enhances door-zipper operation
  and maximizes volume at end walls</li><li> Vestibule overhangs tent door so rain
  stays outside</li><li> Multiple storage options include corner pockets, roof pockets
  and hang loops; use the door pocket to hold door out of the way or for storage</li><li>
  Siliconized 30-denier ripstop nylon fly is lightweight, highly water repellent and
  tear resistant</li><li> No-wick welded construction ensures that moisture won''t
  sneak through susceptible areas, such as guy-out points, pole wraps and zippers</li></ul>'
