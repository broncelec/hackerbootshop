description_list: <h4>Stroll through wintry snowscapes with these Atlas Elektra 923
  snowshoes, which boast a women-specific design and great traction for use across
  rolling terrain</h4><ul class="description"><li> Women-specific, V-shaped frames
  are made from sturdy 6061 aluminum and are designed to facilitate a woman's natural
  stride</li><li> Nose and tail shapes are optimized to provide a balanced platform
  for stable footing and facilitate an easy, natural stride</li><li> Free-Rotating(TM)
  Suspension lets the binding rotate much farther forward than previous Atlas designs,
  freeing up the stride and reducing the amount of tail flip</li><li> The result of
  the design is that freedom of movement is increased, the toe crampon can bite into
  snow better and the foot is allowed a more natural rotation</li><li> Wrapp(TM) Trail
  bindings use a continuous webbing design that tightens snugly with a single pull;
  bindings also cradle feet and arches for a secure, comfortable fit</li><li> Abrasion-resistant,
  lightweight Nytex(TM) nylon decks stay flexible when cold and stand up to the elements
  for lasting use</li><li> Steel toe crampons supply sure-footed traction on icy and
  snowy terrain; heel crampons increase traction while traversing and descending</li><li>
  Recommended load specification for the Atlas Elektra 923 snowshoes includes weight
  of hiker with gear</li></ul>
