  backcountry, the burly Look XM 16 S C130 randonee bindings let you charge down the

  DIN that ranges from 7 to 16</li><li> Bindings have a low overall stand height for
  great stability while skiing</li><li> Bindings include 130mm wide brakes to fit
  your fat powder skis</li><li> Flip the climbing bars up with a ski pole to take
  some stress off your legs when you're skinning uphill; two different positions let
  you choose the height that works for you</li><li> Look XM 16 S C130 randonee bindings
