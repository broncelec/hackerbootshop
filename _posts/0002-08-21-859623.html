<h3>The REI CoolMax(R) Eco Multisport Quarter socks are made with EcoMade(TM) fabric made from recycled plastic bottles</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> CoolMax EcoMade fabric offers the same moisture-wicking, quick-drying performance as regular CoolMax, yet is made of recycled PET</li>
<li> Nylon adds durability and spandex offers stretch and shape retention</li>
<li> Mesh-knit toe and instep panels promote airflow and move moisture away from feet, keeping them dry and blister free</li>
<li> Fully cushioned bottoms and heels add shock absorption and protection from wear</li>
<li> Lin Toe(R) ''no feel'' seams reduce irritation and chafing along toes</li>
<li> Seconds; item has minor cosmetic imperfections that do not affect product performance</li>
</ul>
