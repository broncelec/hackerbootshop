description_list: <h4>Volkl Shiro skis bring jumbo 119mm waists and full rocker to
  play on powder, but they also charge onto soft snow and groomers with gusto</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> Full rocker increases maneuverability in deep snow, making
  turns in powder effortless and adding a surflike, floaty feel</li><li> The smooth,
  gradual rocker from tip to tail also creates uninterrupted edge contact on groomed
  runs so you can deftly maneuver these wide-waisted powder skis back to the lifts</li><li>
  Multilayer wooden core uses dense ash under the bindings to ensure screws won't
  come loose during harsh landings</li><li> Soft poplar in the remainder of the skis
  makes them snappy and responsive</li><li> Tough Box construction sheathes the wood
  core in composite and fiberglass to remain durable during high speed landings and
  to snap back quickly from aggressive turns</li><li> Carbon laminate in the bottom
  layer of the core stabilizes the ride and further enhances durability</li><li> Stiff
  flex zone in front adds stability, and medium flex underfoot transitions to the
  soft tail that aids in turning on groomers and maneuvering in pow</li><li> Directional
  twin tip heavily favors skiing forward but allows you to ski and land jumps backward
  if needed</li><li> Volkl Shiro skis require bindings with wide brakes</li><li> Base
  or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
