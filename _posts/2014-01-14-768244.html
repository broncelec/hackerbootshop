description_list: '<h4>Not just a scaled-down adult pack, the Jib 35 pack from Osprey
  was designed to fit children''s dimensions and proportions-and it grows with them!
  Fits a variety of backs, thanks to its generous torso-length adjustment: just rip
  it, adjust it and stick it</h4><ul class="description"><li> Pack is sized to fit
  kids approximately 10 to 14 years old</li><li> To ensure a healthy and comfortable
  carry, loaded pack should not be more than 15 to 20 percent of child''s body weight</li><li>
  AirScape backpanel features three sections of ridged foam and a central air chimney
  for increased ventilation</li><li> Running down the sidewall, peripheral rods anchor
  to load-lifter straps and hipbelt, actively transferring load and resisting sag</li><li>
  Top-loading design gives you easy access to the pack''s contents; two zippered pockets
  in lid let you stash maps and small items</li><li> ErgoPull hipbelt closure provides
  extra cinching leverage-drawing tension along top and bottom, not through the center-relieving
  hipbone pressure</li><li> Zippered pockets on hipbelt let you stash small essentials,
  such as a digital camera, snacks, lipbalm and sunblock</li><li> Front stretch pocket
