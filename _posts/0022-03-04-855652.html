<h3>The women's REI Evaporator Single Ski Bag is a great choice for transporting your skis and poles to the mountain, or taking them on a flight</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Heavy-duty tarpaulin-lined interior fits a pair of skis up to 191cm in length and a pair of ski poles; dedicated internal sleeves hold poles neatly</li>
<li> Mesh panels and grommet openings promote air circulation and moisture drainage, helping combat edge rust</li>
<li> Compression straps on outside of bag secure contents; also use them to secure the folded-over end of the bag when you're carrying short skis</li>
<li> Webbing carry handles with padded hand strap ease transport</li>
<li> The REI Evaporator Single ski bag is constructed with rugged 600-denier polyester and beefy zippers to last many seasons</li>
</ul>
