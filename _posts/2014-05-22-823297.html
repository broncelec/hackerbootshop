description_list: <h4>Inspired by Shane McConkey, the updated super-fat K2 Pon2oons
  will keep you afloat when the snow's so deep you wish you had a snorkel</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> Straight skinny skis are a thing of the past! Perfect for
  the days when the sky opens up and dumps fresh powder, these skis will also work
  well when you're hiking for your turns</li><li> Fir-and-aspen core produces a natural
  flex, allowing the ski to achieve full contact with the snow throughout the turn</li><li>
  Torsion Box design utilizes a Triaxial-braided wood core to create a high degree
  of rebound and performance</li><li> Triaxial braiding wraps an interlocking fiberglass
  weave around the wood core providing torsional stiffness</li><li> Powder Rocker
  offers unparalleled performance in deep and soft snow, offering a surf-like feel;
  camber under foot for edge hold in firm conditions</li><li> Powder-specific sidecut
  tapers from a massive 157mm in the tip to 132mm in the waist and 122mm in the tail
  (179cm length)-now that's fat! Dimensions of the Pon2oon increase as the ski gets
  longer, maxing out at 134mm under foot in the 189cm length</li><li> A touch of standard
  sidecut underfoot gives you control and stability to navigate your way back to the
  trailhead, heli, cat or lift</li><li> Asymmetrical graphics line up to inspire flight
  while you pilot these big boys down the mountain</li><li> Requires bindings with
  wide brakes</li><li> K2 recommends using the Pon2oon skis for 90% soft snow and
  10% variable snow</li><li> Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
