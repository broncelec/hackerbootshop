description_list: <h4>The ASICS GEL-Lyte33(TM) 3 Road-Running Shoes get serious about
  weight reduction, dropping almost 2 oz per shoe over the previous version for a
  lightweight, natural running experience</h4><ul class="description"><li> Updated
  with nearly seamless uppers and Solyte(R) midsoles to maximize performance while
  minimizing weight</li><li> The use of seamless materials reduces the potential for
  irritation and friction caused by traditional stitches and seams</li><li> ASICS
  GEL-Lyte33 3 Road-Running Shoes are designed for underpronators and neutral runners</li><li>
  Deep flex grooves are aligned to the joints of the foot, enabling the shoes to adapt
  and respond to the athlete's exact load and positional change from first impact
  to toe-off</li><li> Dual-density Solyte(R) lasting uses proprietary polymer material
  that's lighter than standard EVA and offers enhanced cushioning longevity</li><li>
  Similar to the geometry seen in racing flats, a low heel-toe differential reduces
  midsole weight to improve economy and encourage faster running</li><li> 6mm heel-to-toe
  drop positions this shoe as a transition between a barefoot style and a traditional
  running shoe</li><li> ASICS GEL-Lyte33(TM) 3 Road-Running Shoes have lightweight
  heel construction to comfortably hug your feet while minimizing structural weight</li><li>
  Minimal outsole material is positioned only in high abrasion areas</li></ul>
