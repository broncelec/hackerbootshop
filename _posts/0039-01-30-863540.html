<h3>With a merino-wool-blend fabric that wicks moisture and dries fast, the women's Warm Merino long underwear tights from The North Face are an ideal midweight layer for active, cold-weather play</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Moisture-wicking merino wool, polyolefin and polyester fabric naturally resists odors</li>
<li> FlashDry(TM) micro-particles embedded in the fabric dramatically improve dry time and breathability</li>
<li> Made of crushed coconut shells and crushed volcanic rock, FlashDry micro-particles will not wash out</li>
<li> Next-to-skin fit; flatlock seams help reduce chafing</li>
<li> Closeout</li>
</ul>
