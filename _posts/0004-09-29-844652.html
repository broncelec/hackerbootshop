<h3>The updated REI XT 85 pack delivers comfort, performance and user-friendly features in a size and design that accommodate anything from a 10-day wilderness expedition to a weekend jaunt</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Precurved shoulder straps and hipbelt comfortably match your anatomy from day one; hipbelt webbing system adjusts with a forward pull in an ergonomic motion</li>
<li> Sculpted back panel has multiple peaks and valleys to reduce contact areas and allow sweat vapor to escape; soft foam conforms to your back for a stable fit</li>
<li> Silky-smooth Dri-Lex(R) fabric lines all body contact areas for chafe-free comfort</li>
<li> Hybrid frame blends external-frame comfort and load transfer with internal-frame stability; X-Brace crossed stays stabilize the hipbelt against unwanted sag</li>
<li> Sleeve in the main compartment accommodates most hydration systems; ports allow for routing the bite valve over either shoulder (reservoir sold separately)</li>
<li> Front pocket arrangement provides 2 zippered pockets on top of a stretch-woven stash pocket, allowing access to your gear without interference from the other pockets</li>
<li> Floating lid can be removed and stowed; secure key pocket is inside lid; double top collar allows you to vary the pack's capacity</li>
<li> Dual side-zip access allows easy retrieval of items buried deep in the pack; bottom sleeping bag compartment features a smooth curved zipper</li>
<li> Quick-release straps on the bottom of the pack body provide an easy attachment point for sleep pad or tent</li>
<li> Lash points on the hipbelt make it easy to keep camera and GPS pouches within easy reach; attachment points on the pack body feature TipGrips to keep trekking poles in place</li>
<li> Hipbelt pocket provides handy storage for items needed on the hike; drawcorded water bottle pockets hold bottles vertically for easy access or horizontally for extra security</li>
<li> Sew-free construction at lash points provides a lighter-weight alternative to sewn constructions without sacrificing strength</li>
