description_list: '<h4>The Time Xpresso 4 bike pedals are light, easy to get in and
  out of and offer a high level of adjustability to offer good efficiency and comfort
  on your road rides</h4><ul class="description"><li> Instead of metal springs, flexible
  carbon fiber blades tension the retention mechanisms, ensuring a secure pedal connection
  while reducing weight</li><li> Getting into the pedals is a breeze, thanks to the
  low-tension engagement of the retention mechanism: step in with little pressure,
  pedal engages cleat, and then pedal away! Excellent foot-to-pedal stability and
  solid power transfer are achieved through the oversize pedal platform and low stack
  height (distance from shoe sole to pedal axle)</li><li> Light and sturdy composite
  pedal bodies spin smoothly around steel axles; replaceable stainless-steel wear
  plates enhance pedal durability</li><li> Foot/pedal interface can be tuned and optimized,
  offering adjustment to Q-factor (side-to-side), +/-5deg of angular float and 2</li><li>5mm
  of lateral float; 15deg release angle</li><li> Time Xpresso 4 bike pedals come with
  cleats and mounting hardware; compatible with most road cycling shoes with 3-hole
  mounts</li></ul>'
