description_list: <h4>With wide waists to supply ample flotation for any powder day
  and enough stability to negotiate less-than-ideal conditions, the Atomic Access
  skis are ready to carve some fresh lines on steep terrain</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Portly 100mm waists and lightweight design mean the skis float and turn with ease
  in powder</li><li> Early rise in the tip and tail enhances powder skiing forward
  or switch; traditional camber underfoot enhances edge grip on firm snow</li><li>
  Traditional camber of the Access extends back farther toward the tail to enhance
  power at the end of the turn and increase control on groomed runs</li><li> Wood
  core provides smooth handling at high speeds and in deep powder snow</li><li> Sidewall
  construction ensures maximum torsional rigidity, uncanny edge grip and controlled
  tip-to-tail flex; sidewall is reinforced in binding area with 2 layers of material</li><li>
  Half cap construction in tip and tail reduces swing weight and chipping when your
  skis bang together</li><li> Atomic Access skis feature 100mm waists that require
  bindings with wide brakes</li><li> Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
