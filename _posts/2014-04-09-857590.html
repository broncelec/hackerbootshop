description_list: <h4>Our Novara Gotham is a revolutionary design for city riding
  with a Gates(R) carbon belt drive and a NuVinci(R) N360 rear hub</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  It's a quiet ride, fully outfitted with a rack, fenders and lights</li><li> NuVinci
  N360 continuously variable planetary (CVP) rear hub uses rotating, tilting balls
  inside the hub to supply smooth, quiet shifts whenever you want, even when stopped</li><li>
  NuVinci CVP design also means there's no indexed "ker-chunk" between gears, just
  a continuous range that lets you find the amount of resistance that best suits your
  needs</li><li> Gates CenterTrack Belt Drive uses a carbon-reinforced belt instead
  of a chain for a quiet ride-belt doesn't require lubrication, so there's no greasy
  chain to deal with</li><li> Using the twist shifters is intuitively simple and offers
  super-smooth, seamless movement throughout the gearing range with a flick of the
  wrist</li><li> 6061 butted aluminum frame and fork are lightweight and strong</li><li>
  Tektro Gemini hydraulic disc brakes deliver superior stopping power</li><li> Head
  tube features Novara "N Dock" mounting braze-ons to attach a cargo-hauling Barrow
  basket (please note that the basket is sold separately)</li><li> Rear rack on the
  Gotham is ready for cargo, quickly accepting panniers or trunk bag (not included)-great
  for carrying groceries or work essentials</li><li> Lezyne 500-lumen rechargeable
  headlight brightly leads the way, and a built-in battery-powered rack-mounted tail
  light aids rear visibility</li><li> Upright-riding cockpit is designed for comfort,
  thanks to the Selle Royal saddle, mustache-style handlebar and ergonomic grips</li><li>
  Puncture-resistant Schwalbe Marathon tires feature sure grip and a fast, smooth
  ride</li><li> Rounding out the package are polished fenders to keep road grime and
  water off you and the bike; bell on handlebars signals passing; kickstand makes
  storage/parking easy</li><li> Specs on our Novara Gotham bike are subject to change</li></ul>
