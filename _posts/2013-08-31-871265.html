description_list: <h4>The women's Pendulum Trail-Running Shoes from Vasque strike
  the perfect balance between a lightweight minimalist design and enough padding and
  support to tackle rocky trails</h4><ul class="description"><li> Shoes keep the foot
  close to the ground and optimally positioned for natural forefoot strike</li><li>
  At the same time, an EVA midsole and TPU plate protect the runner from the occasional
  hard heel strike or wayward stone</li><li> Bonded upper minimizes hot spots, while
  a toothy outsole maximizes miles over sketchy terrain</li><li> Pendulum Trail-Running
  Shoes are the lightest-weight trail running shoes made by Vasque</li><li> Closeout</li></ul>
