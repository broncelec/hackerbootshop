description_list: <h4>Whether you bring it hiking, biking or exploring urban waterways,
  the portable Folbot Citibot 100 folding kayak goes where hard-shell kayaks can only
  dream about</h4><ul class="description"><li> Maybe you can't store a hard-shell
  at home, or maybe you want to explore local waters like a beach or a lake; either
  way, you'll want a Folbot</li><li> It sets up in about 10 min</li><li>, and folds
  up into a pack that you can store in your gear closet or your car's trunk</li><li>
  Thanks to a clever tensioning device in the rear of the kayak, you can first assemble
  the frame and then insert it into the skin, streamlining the set-up process</li><li>
  The Citibot 100 is easy to manage on calm waters, and it offers excellent stability
  and surprisingly responsive tracking for a boat of its size</li><li> Used by roofers,
  the military and whitewater-raft makers, a synthetic rubber material called Elvaloy
  is tough like a rhino's hide and protects the hull of the Citibot</li><li> Urethane-coated
  polyester protects the decks; all outer materials on the Folbot Citbot resist UV
  light and are designed to take a beating without puncturing</li><li> Frame of the
  Citibot is just as sturdy as its skin, with stainless-steel keel brackets (say that
  3 times fast), aircraft-grade tubing and anodized aluminum cross pieces</li><li>
  Inflatable chambers called sponsons run the full length of the boat to increase
  tension and lock frame pieces into place; sponsons also flare out the hull to enhance
  stability</li><li> Seat and footpegs adjust to create a comfortable position in
  the cockpit</li><li> Easy-to-open zippers with high-strength zipper heads offer
  access to interior of kayak; rip-and-stick stormflaps and water-resistant closures
  keep things sealed up tight</li><li> Solid aluminum strip protects the bow and stern
  keels</li><li> What's included? Your kayak will come inside its backpack with skin,
  frame, 2 foot braces, 2 air sponsons, 2 safety bladders, and inflatable seat</li></ul>
