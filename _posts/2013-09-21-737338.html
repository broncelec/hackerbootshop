description_list: <h4>Omega Pacific(R)'s revolutionary Link Cam can help you minimize
  your rack and maximize your potential</h4><ul class="description"><li> With a camming
  ratio of over 2</li><li>5:1, the Link Cam can cover the same range as up to four
  standard cams--lighten your rack! Larger range eliminates the need for specialized,
  offset cams for flared-crack protection while higher surface area contact lessens
  "walking" of cam</li><li> Patented, hinged cam lobes collapse even further during
  retraction for easier "plug and go" placements</li><li> Maintaining a constant cam
  angle of 13</li><li>5deg, Link Cams achieve a wide range without sacrificing holding
  power</li><li> Built with a hybrid blend of materials and advanced metal-injection
  molding process, Link Cams offer the ultimate in strength and versatility</li><li>
  Made with 17-4 aircraft stainless steel on the inner links and lightweight 7000-series
  aluminum on the outer link lobes</li><li> Cross-cabling and "Swivlet" connectors
  ensure smooth trigger action and increased range</li><li> Lightweight, rugged Spectra
  slings for lasting service and reliability</li><li> Link Cams are great for that
  crux move, just grab, place and relax!</li></ul>
