<h3>The REI Nikole day bag boasts a convertible design that goes from a mini backpack to a sling pack, so you're ready for any occasion</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Main body of bag is made from 100% recycled PET; each bag keeps 28 16-oz</li>
<li> plastic bottles out of landfills! Post-consumer recycled PET polyester is tough enough to endure the daily grind</li>
<li> Shoulder strap design allows use as a single sling or 2-strap backpack-simply unclip a strap and tuck it away to convert to a sling style</li>
<li> Zippered panel opening on main compartment opens wide to access items such as magazines, books and files; interior padded pocket holds e-book reader or small netbook</li>
<li> Front pocket features a panel organizer to stow your daily essentials such as wallet, MP3 player, change, keys and pens</li>
<li> Zippered front pocket includes a key fob and small pockets for must-have items</li>
<li> Back panel features a zippered vertical pocket; inside is a smaller pocket for your passport</li>
<li> Zip-away side pocket is sized for a water bottle; side slip pocket can keep a small umbrella within reach</li>
<li> Air mesh padding on back panel and shoulder straps controls moisture by wicking perspiration away from your body for cool carrying comfort</li>
<li> Special buy</li>
