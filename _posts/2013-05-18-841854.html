description_list: <h4>Cruise the groomers in the Nordica Cruise 70 ski boots, explore
  the runs and enjoy your day on the mountain</h4><ul class="description"><li> Dual-density
  plastic maximizes ease of entry regardless of temperature; even if you have high
  insteps, getting your foot in the boot is hassle free</li><li> Soft shell flaps
  make it easy to get your foot in the boot; no more standing on 1 foot, hunching
  over, forcing your instep between 2 unforgiving, pinching plastic flaps</li><li>
  Liners snugly wrap feet in cushioning foam; closed-cell foam against the shells
  enhances warmth</li><li> Liners provide a personalized fit around heel, ankle and
  center of foot when custom molded</li><li> Footbeds optimize foot position to create
  an effortless skiing stance, and they offer easy support for comfortable wear all
  day long</li><li> Upper buckle features a ladder that changes position to ease closure
  of the top portion of the boot; ladder changes position without the use of tools</li><li>
  Top of the boot a little tight? Cuffs feature an adjustable hex nut that increases
  the circumference of the top of the boot by 3 - 5mm and relaxes the angle of the
  boots</li><li> Power strap adjusts cuff for snugness and pressure against the shins</li><li>
  With a flex index of 70, Nordica Cruise 70 ski boots provide light resistance against
  a forward lean, appropriate for most novice skiers</li><li> Extra-wide last accommodates
  forefoot measurements up to 104mm</li></ul>
