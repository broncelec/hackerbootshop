description_list: <h4>Perfect for learning the balance, steering and coordination
  needed for bike riding, the award-winning Skuut Balance bike is designed for kids
  aged 2 - 5</h4><ul class="description"><li> Without pedals and training wheels,
  kids intuitively learn to refine their handling skills by first ''walking'' the
  bike along</li><li> As their confidence and abilities improve, kids can lengthen
  their strides and increase the amount of time their feet are off the ground, resulting
  in more ''Wheee!'' time</li><li> Braking is accomplished by simply putting feet
  down on the ground</li><li> The simple 3-piece design is made from birchwood and
  coated with a nontoxic lacquer; assembly is easy and takes just minutes</li><li>
  Steering angles are limited so that children don't accidentally turn too hard and
  crash</li><li> Seat adjusts from 13</li><li>5 to 16</li><li>5 in</li><li> high to
  accommodate a range of heights and sizes; vinyl seat is easy to clean</li><li> Beefy
  12 in</li><li> rubber tires inflate up to 40psi, though perform best between 20
  and 25psi</li></ul>
