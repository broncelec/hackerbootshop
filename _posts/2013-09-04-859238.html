description_list: <h4>With 108mm waists to shred off-piste snow with stability and
  a rockered profile to get the most out of deep snow, the Salomon Rocker 2 108 skis
  are powder planks you can ski any day</h4><ul class="description"><li> 108mm waists
  offer more than enough flotation for epic days in bottomless powder, and they are
  stable enough to easily maneuver over rough, crusty, and windblown snow</li><li>
  Powder-rockered tips and tails deliver maximum flotation and excellent performance
  at high speeds</li><li> When put on edge, about 80% of the skis' edge length contacts
  the snow to make groomer skiing easy</li><li> Designed for demanding skiers who
  require high performance, full wood core delivers direct transmission of power with
  precision and efficiency</li><li> Perfect for pulling off freeski maneuvers, a single-layer
  cap design provides precise edge grip and efficient energy transfer from skier to
  snow</li><li> Elastomer inserts placed over the edges absorb vibrations, resulting
  in a smooth ride that softens ski-to-snow contact</li><li> Slightly raised tails
  let you ride backward and stick the occasional switch landing</li><li> Tips and
  tails feature a honeycomb structure that reduces weight to make the skis more maneuverable
  and playful</li><li> Tips are designed to slice through deep snow without hooking
  and decrease deflection at high speeds</li><li> Fiber reinforcements laid directly
  on the edges add torsional rigidity and improve edge durability, and wide metal
  edges withstand big impacts and improve shock resistance</li><li> Edge-free tips
  and tails pivot smoothly through turns and resist catching in deep snow</li><li>
  108mm waists of the Salomon Rocker 2 108 skis require binding with wide brakes</li><li>
  Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
