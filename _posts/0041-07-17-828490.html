<h3>The women's REI Lyra 3-season backpacking synthetic sleeping bag features amazing compressibility and warmth while balancing price and performance</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Women-specific bags are cut to match a woman's shape, and provide extra insulation for warmth</li>
<li> Tested by an independent third-party lab using European Norm protocol, the EN temperature ratings allow direct comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags</li>
<li> Synthetic Thermawave polyester insulation is durable and highly compressible; synthetic polyester fill retains some insulating properties even when wet</li>
<li> 60% of insulation is put on top of bag where it contributes the most warmth and loft</li>
<li> Relaxed fit through the shoulders and hips gives you room to move for a better night's rest</li>
<li> Mummy shape is thermally efficient, yet roomy enough to ensure sleeping comfort</li>
<li> Ripstop nylon shell fabric has a nice hand feel, is lightweight, durable, water- and abrasion resistant; nylon taffeta lining is soft and tear-resistant</li>
<li> Shell fabric is treated with a Durable Water Repellent finish for water resistance and quick drying</li>
<li> Contoured hood, insulated full-face muffler, puffy interior yoke, roomy footbox and full-length-zipper draft tube with ground-level seams all work to keep heat in and cold out</li>
<li> External chest pocket keeps small essentials-headlamp, watch, glasses-right at hand and easy to find in the dark</li>
<li> Special pocket in hood can be stuffed with clothing layers to make a pillow that stays in place; no need for a pillow to take up valuable space in your backpack</li>
<li> Pad loops provide attachment points to keep your sleeping bag and pad together, so you needn't worry about rolling onto the cold ground (straps sold separately)</li>
<li> Full-length zipper is backed by wide, antisnag binding tape</li>
<li> Differentiated drawcords (1 round, 1 flat) allow quick identification, even in the dark, so neck and hood adjustments are a cinch</li>
</ul>
