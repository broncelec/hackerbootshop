<h3>With a clean, ski-inspired aesthetic, the Kardiak Triclimate 3-in-1 jacket by The North Face offers waterproof protection and season-long versatility thanks to fast, convenient convertibility</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Three different ways to wear the system: wear shell jacket and zip-in liner jacket together for maximum protection or wear either piece on its own as weather warrants</li>
<li> HyVent(TM) 2-layer construction is waterproof, windproof and breathable; fully sealed seams prevent moisture from seeping through</li>
<li> Zip handwarmer pockets; wrist pocket with goggles cloth; internal goggles pocket</li>
<li> Fully adjustable, removable and helmet-compatible hood ensures a weather-blocking, personalized fit</li>
<li> Powder skirt with gripping elastic keeps snow out</li>
<li> Cinch adjustable hem and rip-and-stick wrist cuffs help seal out cold air and retain valuable warmth; core vents let you control airflow and your comfort</li>
<li> The North Face Kardiak Triclimate zip-in/out polyester fleece liner jacket offers warmth without extra bulk</li>
<li> Liner jacket has zippered handwarmer pockets for convenience when wearing liner on its own</li>
<li> Easy zip-in system mates the liner jacket and shell jacket together for added warmth and allows easy reach-in access to the shell's interior features</li>
</ul>
