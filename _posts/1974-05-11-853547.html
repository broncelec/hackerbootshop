<h3>From December powder to April corn, the Freedom Stretch Triclimate 3-in-1 insulated jacket by The North Face offers waterproof protection and an adaptable design for whatever the mountain dishes out</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Three different ways to wear the system: wear shell jacket and zip-in liner jacket together for maximum protection or wear either piece on its own as weather warrants</li>
<li> HyVent(TM) 2-layer construction is waterproof, windproof and breathable; fully sealed seams prevent moisture from seeping through</li>
<li> Adjustable powder skirt with gripping elastic keeps snow out; snaps let you integrate the powder skirt with compatible pants by The North Face (sold separately)</li>
<li> Chest pocket; zip handwarmer pockets; wrist pocket with goggles cloth; internal goggles pocket; internal media pocket</li>
<li> Cinch adjustable hem and rip-and-stick wrist cuffs help seal out cold air and retain valuable warmth; core vents let you control airflow and your comfort</li>
<li> Fully adjustable, removable hood ensures a weather-blocking, personalized fit</li>
<li> The North Face Freedom Stretch Triclimate zip-in/out liner jacket is lined with cozy polyester fleece to keep you warm without inhibiting movement</li>
<li> Liner jacket features zippered handwarmer pockets</li>
<li> Easy zip-in system mates the liner jacket and shell jacket together for added warmth and allows easy reach-in access to the shell's interior features</li>
</ul>
