<h3>The Inferno -20degF down bag from The North Face offers protection and comfort on expeditions in extreme, subzero conditions where minimal weight and maximum warmth are critical</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Pertex(R) 20-denier nylon ripstop shell is lightweight and durable, and offers silky softness that enhances the insulation's loft</li>
<li> Waterproof, breathable Pertex shell features a Durable Water Repellent finish that causes water to bead up and roll off</li>
<li> Trapezoidal baffle construction evenly distributes 850-fill-power goose down and prevents cold spots by keeping down from shifting from side to side</li>
<li> Vaulted footbox allows natural foot movement and eliminates excess lateral space, increasing thermal efficiency to keep your feet warm and comfortable</li>
<li> The North Face Inferno sleeping bag includes a compression stuff sack that doubles as a summit daypack</li>
</ul>
