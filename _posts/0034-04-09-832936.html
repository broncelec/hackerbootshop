<h3>Textured for great comfort and water absorption, the large-size REI MultiTowel is soft and quick drying</h3>

<li> Waffle texture allows the towel to absorb up to 8 times its weight in water, yet wring out almost completely dry</li>
<li> Ultrasoft synthetic fabric is light and compact, taking up very little space in your backpack or bag</li>
<li> Quick-attach loop makes it easy to hang the towel to dry</li>
<li> The REI MultiTowel comes in a small carry pouch</li>
</ul>
