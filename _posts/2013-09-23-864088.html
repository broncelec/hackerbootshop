description_list: <h4>The ultralight, down-filled Marmot Atom Sleeping Bag has been
  used by alpinists as a bivvy bag on extreme climbs, but its comfortable, silky fabric
  also makes it great for warm-weather backpacking</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  With a European Norm (EN) lower-limit rating of 43degF, the Atom Sleeping Bag is
  great for mild-weather ultralight backpacking, typically in summer</li><li> Nylon
  shell is lightweight yet strong; a durable water repellent finish causes moisture
  to bead up and roll off</li><li> Premium-quality 850-fill-power goose down is extremely
  compressible and offers an exceptional warmth-to-weight ratio</li><li> Down is treated
  to resist moisture to maintain warmth; treated down stays drier 10 times longer,
  maintains 150% more loft and dries 30% faster than untreated down</li><li> Face
  muff allows hood to be cinched snug without digging into your face</li><li> Down-insulated
  draft tube backs full-length zipper to keep the cold out</li><li> Zipper guards
  prevent zipper snags; locking zippers keep bag from opening if you toss and turn
  at night</li><li> Classic trapezoidal foot box lets your feet move freely and comfortably,
  and allows goose down to loft fully to keep your toes toasty warm</li><li> The Marmot
  Atom Sleeping Bag comes with a stuff sack and storage sack</li><li> European Norm
  (EN) is an independent third-party temperature rating, allowing accurate comparisons
  across brands with other EN-rated bags</li></ul>
