description_list: <h4>Built with hike/ski levers, the advanced-level women's Atomic
  Waymaker Carbon 100 W ski boots hike above the stashes and shred hard on the descents
  thanks to powerful carbon reinforcements</h4><ul class="description"><li> Hike/ski
  levers release cuffs from lower shells to increase range of motion when hiking;
  return levers to ski position to lock down cuffs during the descent</li><li> Carbon-reinforced
  areas of the cuff and shell offers direct power transmission and excellent responsiveness
  while maintaining an easy feel and sensitivity on the front of boot</li><li> Single-component
  shell moves as a single piece to maximize power transfer and ensure high performance,
  and pliable plastic flex zones adapt instantly to the shape of foot</li><li> Located
  between the first buckle and the toe, flexible shell zones made of soft plastic
  improve balance, circulation, warmth and sensitivity</li><li> Each boot liner features
  differing materials on the left and right; firm material helps you feel the terrain
  on the inside of the turn and soft material cushions recovery</li><li> Women-specific
  liners feature cushioning insoles and very warm faux fur to enhance comfort</li><li>
  Custom-moldable liners mold to forefeet and ankles to increase heel hold</li><li>
