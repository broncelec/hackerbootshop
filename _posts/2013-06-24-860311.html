description_list: <h4>Light, lively and rockered, the advanced-level Volkl RTM 81
  skis with bindings use reinforced sidewalls to increase precision on groomers and
  transition easily to soft snow when given the chance</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Built with all features of the RTM 80 skis, the RTM 81 skis raise the performance
  one more notch by using reinforced sidewalls to directly transfer energy into precise
  turns</li><li> When tipped over and put on edge, the smooth, gradual rocker from
  tip to tail creates uninterrupted edge contact during the turn, ripping graceful
  arcs into groomed terrain</li><li> Full rocker also increases maneuverability in
  soft snow, so you can play on the backside of the mountain or hunt down overlooked
  stashes of pow</li><li> You'll notice a lively, snappy feel when powering through
  turns thanks to the steel laminate built into the wood core</li><li> High-performance
  bindings are integrated into the body of the skis, creating a rigid connection that
  precisely transfers your motions</li><li> Extremely lightweight toe and heel components
  securely wrap the boot lugs and make driving skis through the turns that much easier</li><li>
  Bindings feature DIN 4 - 12 release settings, a range suited to advanced skiers
  at medium to high speeds</li><li> Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
