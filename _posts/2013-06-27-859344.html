description_list: <h4>With rockered tips and progressive sidecut, the K2 TalkBack
  randonee/telemark skis are as adept going up a hill as they are coming down through
  deep fresh snow in the backcountry</h4><ul class="description"><li> All-terrain
  rocker features elevated tips that float through powder snow with ease; traditional
  camber underfoot ensures good power and edge hold on firm snow</li><li> Cores combine
  aspen, paulownia and bamboo woods to create skis that are stable and predictable
  underfoot and light and soft in the tips and tails</li><li> Located at the tips
  and tails, a weave of carbon improves responsiveness and edge grip without adding
  much weight</li><li> Cap construction envelops the cores and internal materials,
  keeping overall weight light and durability high</li><li> Progressive sidecut produces
  different curve shapes along different parts of the skis-more aggressive in the
  tips, less aggressive in the tails</li><li> The progressive sidecut results in confident,
  quick turn initiation in hard snow and easy release in crud and powder</li><li>
  Top sheets feature a hydrophobic material similar to that used on the bases to prevent
  snow from sticking and building up while you're skinning</li><li> Low-profile tip
  grommets use a durable rubber coating to disguise slits designed to accommodate
  Z-Clip attachments on K2 climbing skins (sold separately)</li><li> Flat tails let
  you easily plunge your skis into firm snow when building anchors or staking out
  a tent</li><li> Concave notches in the tails of the K2 TalkBack skis keep non-K2-brand
  skins securely centered on the tails</li><li> Base or topsheet color may vary from
  online photo</li></ul>
