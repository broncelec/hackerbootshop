description_list: <h4>Melding freestyle trick-ready features with big-mountain construction,
  the Line Blend skis are designed for those who roam all terrain from the park to
  the backcountry for a fresh powder fix</h4><ul class="description"><li> Twin-tip
  design provides freestyle performance on all terrain, and symmetrical flex pattern
  in tips and tails creates identical responsiveness whether skiing forward or switch</li><li>
  Tip and tail rocker floats high in powder whether skiing forward or switch; relatively
  low rise planes through powder instead of plowing up and over</li><li> Core consists
  of light and strong maple wood stringers surrounded by aspen wood to provide power,
  stability and long-lasting responsiveness</li><li> Widest points of the tips and
  tails are close to the center of the skis, reducing tail drag and hooking in powder</li><li>
  Cap construction on top of skis blends light responsiveness with the durability
  and solid feel of sidewalls</li><li> Geometry of skis incorporates 5 different turn
  radii to create effortless turn initiation with solid edge hold and responsive exits</li><li>
  Thin cores and sidewalls in the tips reduce weight and make the skis easier to control</li><li>
  Line Blend skis feature 100mm waists that require bindings with wide brakes</li><li>
  Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
