  with the MSR HyperFlow(TM) water filter</h4><ul class="description"><li> Backpacker
  April ''08: ''''The HyperFlow is so fast and light it converted several editors
  who had sworn off filters in favor of chemical treatment</li><li>''''</li><li> Hollow
  fiber technology offers an extremely high flow rate of 2</li><li>75 liters per minute</li><li>
  At just 7</li><li>8 oz, the HyperFlow is the lightest, most compact pump filter
  created by MSR</li><li> Filter physically removes particles, protozoa, and bacteria
  down to 0</li><li>2 microns in size, including giardia, salmonella, cryptosporidia
  and others</li><li> Pump is fully field maintainable and does not require tools
  for complete disassembly</li><li> Included Quick-Connect(TM) bottle cap interfaces
  with MSR hydration products, Nalgene bottles and other containers with 63mm threaded
  openings</li><li> Quick-Connect(TM) cap allows the pump to attach directly to the
  bottle or hydration bladder for the most convenient filling</li><li> Included prefilter
  attaches to the end of the intake hose and blocks larger contaminants from entering
  the microfilter</li><li> Prefilter floats near the surface of the water to avoid
  intake of contaminants located at the floor of your water source</li><li> Over-molded
  end caps on the pump provide an excellent grip and pumping comfort</li><li> Adapt
  the HyperFlow pump into a pump-free gravity filter with the HyperFlow Gravity kit,
