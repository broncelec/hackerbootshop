  riding, the Union Atlas snowboard bindings feature flexible highbacks that let you

  flex, with the top third being the softest and the bottom third the stiffest</li><li>
  3D Direct-Connect ankle straps eliminate elasticity and evenly distribute pressure
  across feet and ankles for increased comfort and board control</li><li> Multi-position
