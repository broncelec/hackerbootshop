description_list: <h4>With a rockered profile, built-in pop and lightweight construction,
  the Ride Compact women's snowboard offers a lively, fun ride through the park</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> LowRize(TM) rocker provides optimal hook-free goodness
  and allows you to lock in big landings without the fear of "rocker washout"</li><li>
  Twin shape places you in a centered stance for a balanced ride whether riding regular
  or switch</li><li> Tuned wood core is highly durable, and retains pop and flex for
  long-lasting performance; woven fiberglass contributes to a fun, forgiving ride</li><li>
  Skate-inspired Slimewalls(R) sidewalls absorb impact and smooth the interaction
  between the board and the wood, metal and snowy surfaces you slide on</li><li> Edges
  contain nearly 50% more steel than standard snowboard edges, resulting in unmatched
  resistance to edge cracking; edges can be "detuned" to enlarge board's turning radii</li><li>
  Ride Compact women's snowboard features a Fusion 1500 extruded base that absorbs
  wax well and is easy to repair</li><li> </li></ul>
