  and feel comfortable</h4><ul class="description"><li> Great for cruising the boardwalk
  or a trip into town, the Electra Cruiser 1 has everything you need for a great ride</li><li>
  Innovative geometry places pedals fore of the seatpost, which creates a low center
  of gravity and positions rider in an upright, balanced position</li><li> Single-speed
  drivetrain is simplicity itself, so forget about shifting and just get on, ride
  and enjoy a day coasting down the boardwalk or around the park</li><li> Rear coaster
  brake is both effective and intuitively simple to use-just pedal in reverse to brake</li><li>
  26 in</li><li> wheels are inherently stable through turns at slow speeds</li><li>
  Platform pedals accept just about any pair of shoes or sandals; full-length chainguard
  keeps pant legs free of grease and entanglement</li><li> Features a comfortable,
  wide saddle with elastomer springs</li><li> 1 size fits most</li><li> Specs on the
  Electra Cruiser 1 bike are subject to change</li></ul>
