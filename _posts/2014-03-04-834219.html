description_list: <h4>Created for athletes by athletes, the Switch Boreal polarized
  interchangeable sunglasses employ an innovative magnetic system that's easy to use
  on the go-no more bulky, mechanical lens swaps</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Polarized lenses reduce 99% of visible glare from water, snow, sand and pavement
  for increased visual acuity and decreased eye strain</li><li> Switch interchangeable
  system uses high-energy embedded magnets, so lenses jump into place when brought
  near the frames</li><li> Magnets are engineered to stay in place when subjected
  to the intense jarring of skiing, snowboarding, running or mountain biking</li><li>
  Superior grade nylon frames offer a consistent fit and flexibility in all temperatures
  and are extremely impact resistant</li><li> Frames include 2 sets of lenses-1 set
  of polarized lenses for bright light and 1 set of non-polarized, rose-tinted lenses
  for low light</li><li> Matte black frames come with gray polarized lenses, which
  provide true color definition on bright, sunny days</li><li> Cactus frames come
  with amber polarized lenses, which enhance contrast on bright, sunny days</li><li>
  Lightweight and virtually shatterproof, polycarbonate lenses are 20 times more impact
  resistant than glass and one-third the weight</li><li> TriGuard(TM) thin-film lens
  coating is easy to clean, withstands rough handling and causes water to bead up
  and run off</li><li> Magnetic LensPod(TM) keeps your lenses protected in an easy-to-carry,
  contoured case</li><li> Switch Boreal polarized sunglasses also come with a microfiber
  cleaning pouch</li><li> Medium to large fit</li></ul>
