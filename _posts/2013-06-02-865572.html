description_list: <h4>The 3-season NEMO Veda 2P Tent gives 2 backpackers a magical
  combination of light weight, packability and livability you both will love while
  living on the trail</h4><ul class="description"><li> Ultralight design relies on
  2 pairs of trekking poles (sold separately) instead of tent poles to minimize weight
  and create a spacious interior with ample sitting height</li><li> Oversized grommets
  locate the tips of crossed trekking poles; reinforced areas at the top of the tent
  receive pole handles</li><li> Two huge vestibules offer generous protected space
  for both occupants' gear; they roll back with a shed-style overhang for weather
  protection and refreshing airflow</li><li> Wicking fabric overhead effectively manages
  condensation; built-in light pockets make it easy to illuminate the interior with
  headlamps or other lights (sold separately)</li><li> The NEMO Veda 2P Tent comes
  with a drybag-style stuff sack, stakes, guy-out cord and repair kit</li></ul>
