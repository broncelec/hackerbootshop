<h3>The women's REI Lightweight long underwear bottoms are an excellent performance insulating layer for aerobic activities in cold weather</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Polyester and spandex fabric wicks moisture and dries quickly</li>
<li> Fabric protects skin against harmful ultraviolet light with a UPF rating of 50+ and is very soft to the touch</li>
<li> Flatseam construction is soft and non-chafing next to skin</li>
<li> Brushed elastic waistband ensures a comfortable fit outing after outing</li>
<li> Low-bulk fit makes it really easy to layer under a shell or additional insulation</li>
<li> The women's REI Lightweight long underwear bottoms feature a next-to-skin fit that hugs the body and boosts fabric performance</li>
</ul>
