<h3>This lightweight travel sack is great for international hostelling, summer camping, RVs or simply to keep in your trunk for emergencies</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Lofty hollow-core polyester fiber insulation is warm without a lot of bulk, compresses easily for packing and continues to insulate if wet</li>
<li> Unzip zipper and lay bag flat like a comforter or just unzip it partially at the foot for ventilation or to roam around camp without leaving your bag! Short zipper with snap tab closures creates armholes for ventilation</li>
<li> Both zippers have an anti-snag backing for easy entry and exit</li>
<li> Differentiated drawcords (one round, one flat) let you adjust hood and neck easily in the dark</li>
<li> Also works great as a sleeping bag liner for added warmth</li>
<li> Zippered chest pocket holds watch or other small items, alleviating late-night fumbling</li>
<li> Nylon stuff sack included</li>
</ul>
