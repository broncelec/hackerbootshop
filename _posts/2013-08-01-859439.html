description_list: <h4>Combining a soft, intermediate-level flex with roomy footbeds,
  the Lange SX 120 men's ski boots emphasize comfort as you take on steeper terrain
  and faster turns</h4><ul class="description"><li> Soft flex index provides a power
  transfer suited to new intermediate skiers looking to expand their skills</li><li>
  Roomy, 102mm footbeds offer a comfortable fit and can accommodate wide feet</li><li>
  Uniform-density plastic shells ensure highly efficient power transfer, smooth flex
  and finely-tuned responsiveness, even in frigid temperatures</li><li> Shells are
  designed to create a centered, balanced stance on rockered skis to increase efficiency
  of technique and reduce fatigue</li><li> Liners comfortably contour your feet and
  precisely match the internal shape of the shell to create instant responsiveness,
  and they may be custom molded using a heat treatment</li><li> 1-piece toe boxes
  and tongues eliminate seams and overlaps in the tongue attachment area, reducing
  pressure points at the instep and top of the toes</li><li> Specially designed insteps
  provide an excellent fit at the midfoot, resulting in increased circulation and
  greater warmth</li><li> Saddle-stitched seams help reduce hotspots</li><li> Rubber
  soles of the Lange SX 120 ski boots offer excellent grip</li></ul>
