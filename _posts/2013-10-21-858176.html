description_list: <h4>Launch off the lip and find a rhythm all your own with the women's
  Blizzard Samba skis</h4><ul class="description"><li> They attack any terrain with
  rocker designed to reduce chatter on hard snow and maneuver well in soft snow</li><li>
  Blizzard builds the rocker without bending the core, creating a naturally flexing,
  responsive ski that turns easily, resists high-speed chatter and shreds crud and
  pow</li><li> Light camber underfoot assists with grip on hardpack</li><li> Layered
  wood core designed specifically for advanced female skiers creates a lightweight,
  snappy ski with smooth handling</li><li> Fiberglass reinforcement laid in 4 separate
  directions increases snappiness and power underfoot</li><li> Sidewalls direct power
  right to the edges of the skis, resulting in quick side-to-side response</li><li>
  Blizzard Samba skis feature 98mm waists that require bindings with wide brakes</li></ul>
