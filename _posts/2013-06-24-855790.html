  stores cooling water, and bottom layer transfers the cool to your dog</li><li> Light-colored

  cut wraps back and chest to offer a comfortable fit that stays in place; quick-release
  buckles allow an adjustable fit and easy on/off convenience</li><li> Attachment
  loop situated between dog's shoulder blades offers a clip point for a beacon light
  (light sold separately); reflective trim enhances visibility in low light</li></ul>
