description_list: <h4>The Black Diamond Drift skis cruise through soft snow with a
  semi-rockered tip and 100mm waist, and they're light enough to take on long backcountry
  trips in search of untracked terrain</h4><ul class="description"><li> Efficient
  Series ski construction uses less material overall than the Black Diamond Power
  Series, resulting in a lighter-weight ski with just a touch less torsional power</li><li>
  Semi-rockered tips and 100mm waists provide excellent flotation in deep powder</li><li>
  Formula One Technology(TM) with carbon fiber reinforcements features 3 ribs that
  run the length of the ski to deliver liveliness and power for hard-charging skiing</li><li>
  Lightweight paulownia wood cores surrounded by Torsion Box construction provide
  torsional power and energy pop</li><li> Torsion Box technology wraps fiberglass
  around the core like a burrito, creating powerful energy pop</li><li> Efficient-series
  skis feature flat tails you can easily plunge into firm snow when building anchors
  or staking out a tent</li><li> Stainless-steel notches at the tails keep climbing
  skins securely attached and centered</li><li> High-speed sintered bases on the Black
  Diamond Drift skis feature a cross-hatch stone grind for the best balance of durability,
  glide and maintenance</li><li> Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li><li>
