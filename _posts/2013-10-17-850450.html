description_list: <h4>Pushing the envelope as a tough, maneuverable and high-floating
  inflatable stand up paddleboard, the adventure-ready Badfish 11 ft</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  6 in</li><li> MCIT is right at home in moving currents and swift waters</li><li>
  Spanning the interior of the inflatable like an iron spider's web, thousands of
  drop-stitch fibers allow a very high, almost rock-hard, inflation pressure</li><li>
  High air pressure creates a rigid hull without the use of frame parts, and unlike
  hard boards, there's no need to worry about dings or chipped surfaces</li><li> Performance
  is suited to whitewater, flatwater and surf</li><li> PVC-coated, high-denier polyester
  stands up to heavy use</li><li> 11 ft</li><li> 6 in</li><li> length and 275 lb</li><li>
  weight capacity makes the Badfish a great choice for larger paddlers</li><li> 35
  in</li><li> width offers stability that's extremely friendly to beginners</li><li>
  MCIT stands for Multi Chamber Inflatable Technology; the designers of this board
  incorporated special features to enhance performance in roily, unpredictable currents</li><li>
  A unique feature in the world of inflatable SUPs, tapered rails enhance stability
  and make the board highly maneuverable</li><li> Deck sits below the rail height
  to make the MCIT stand up paddleboard very stable in unpredictable currents</li><li>
  Stiffening system increases side-to-side response, and tough cone in the bow increases
  impact resistance</li><li> Deck pad reduces foot fatigue and provides a soft surface
  when kneeling on board</li><li> Center fin with 2 side-bite fins promotes stability;
  7 in</li><li> center fin is removable if you want to paddle in shallow water</li><li>
  Forward deck bungee secures day-tripping accessories</li><li> The Badfish MCIT paddleboard
  packs into a durable backpack and includes a high-pressure, 2-way air pump with
  gauge, valve adaptors and repair kit</li></ul>
