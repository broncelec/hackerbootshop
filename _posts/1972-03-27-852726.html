<h3>The North Face Winter Runners gloves transform from gloves to mittens and back again so you can find the right level of comfort for your long training runs</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Polyester soft-shell gloves are treated with a Durable Water Repellent coating to help shed moisture</li>
<li> Mitten hoods flip over the glove fingers for extra warmth; when not in use, mitten hoods tuck into the backs of the gloves</li>
<li> 5 Dimensional Fit(TM) uses 5 measurements of the hand to construct gloves with an accurate and consistent fit</li>
<li> Radiametric Articulation(TM) improves warmth and blood flow to your fingers by mirroring the natural relaxed curve of the hand</li>
<li> Stash your house key in the small pocket on the palm</li>
<li> The North Face Winter Runners gloves have reflective hits that increase your visibility to motorists at night</li>
</ul>
