description_list: <h4>With resistance suited to advanced cyclists and a bundle of
  extras to maximize indoor training, the CycleOps Fluid2 bike trainer with training
  kit offers quiet operation and a smooth, roadlike feel</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  No manual adjustments needed; simply shift gears as you would when riding outside
  to increase or decrease the resistance, and the faster you pedal the harder it gets</li><li>
  Spin along with virtually no resistance or hammer out a 2000-watt sprint-you will
  never outgrow this trainer no matter what training you require</li><li> With a quick
  load cam lever, you simply adjust the resistance once and then lock it into place
  so there is no guessing each time you put your bike on the trainer</li><li> Combine
  this with a smooth, quiet ride, locking bolt ring and heavy-duty steel construction,
  and you're ready to sprint, spin and climb with confidence</li><li> Cooling mechanism
  on the Fluid2 trainer's resistance unit helps improve longevity and optimal resistance
  performance</li><li> The Cyclops Fluid2 bike trainer features adjustable foot pads,
  a quick release handle, self-cooling mechanism and folding legs for storage</li><li>
  Updated frame works with all standard wheels and now works with 29er mountain bike
  wheels (fits most treads to 2</li><li>25 in</li><li>)</li><li> Included training
  mat protects your floor from sweat and bike grime; also helps stabilize the trainer
  so it will not wander when you're really pedaling fast</li><li> Included cloth bike
  thong stretches between your handlebar and seat to catch dripping sweat, keeping
  it off of your bike below and helping prevent corrosion</li></ul>
