<h3>The REI Siesta double sleeping bag brings the creature comforts of home to the campsite, yurt or cabin</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> This roomy bag provides warmth and comfort for 2 happy campers</li>
<li> Generous barrel shape provides ample interior volume, making it ideal for those who prefer a roomy fit</li>
<li> Hollow-core insulation delivers a balance of compressibility, warmth and durability; bag continues to insulate when wet and dries quickly</li>
<li> Ripstop nylon shell is abrasion- and tear-resistant for years of use</li>
<li> Shell fabric is treated with a Durable Water Repellent finish to repel moisture and stains</li>
<li> Main body features a smooth polyester taffeta lining that breathes for comfort and feels great against skin</li>
<li> Brushed polyester knit lining panels near the head and face offer the softness of your favorite T-shirt with the moisture-wicking properties of a high-tech fabric</li>
<li> Layered offset quilt construction eliminates cold spots</li>
<li> For sharing the load, bag zips apart to become 2 bags; bags can be used separately or connected to another Siesta sleeping bag/sheet (sold separately) for customized comfort</li>
<li> Full side and bottom zipper access; bags can be completely unzipped and opened up for use as comforters</li>
<li> Zippers are backed by wide, antisnag binding tape</li>
<li> REI Siesta +35degF sleeping bag includes a cotton storage bag</li>
