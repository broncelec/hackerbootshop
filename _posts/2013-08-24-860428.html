description_list: <h4>Take to the water in the MTI Maya PFD for your next canoe, kayak
  or rafting trip</h4><ul class="description"><li> It offers up snug comfort via its
  neoprene back panel and an attractive look with its curvy lines</li><li> Stretchy
  neoprene panel in lumbar region is integrated into the fabric of the PFD, and 2
  adjustment straps on either side tighten this panel over the small of the back</li><li>
  Because of the elasticity of the neoprene, you retain mobility without restricting
  movement when the panel is taut</li><li> The fit of this innovative panel offers
  comfort that's not easily matched by traditional PFDs, which sacrifice mobility
  for a tight fit</li><li> Adjustable shoulder straps offer a versatile fit; either
  tighten up the shoulder area for a snug fit or loosen for more chest room</li><li>
  Shoulder adjustments are covered to add protection and provide a smooth, finished
  look to the vest</li><li> Zippered front with an adjustable waist strap offers a
  comfortable fit; 2 zippered cargo pockets with mesh drainage securely store essentials</li><li>
  Durable, 420-denier nylon shell and closed-cell foam flotation offer lasting service;
  reflective piping along the front and back of MTI Maya PFD increases visibility</li><li>
