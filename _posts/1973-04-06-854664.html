<h3>The North Face ThermoBall(TM) hoodie jacket for women puts revolutionary new ThermoBall(TM) synthetic insulation to work</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Warm and light, it mimics down, yet still insulates even when wet</li>
<li> Functioning like down feathers, the tiny round clusters of ThermoBall spun polyester trap warm air, while softly conforming to your body's shape</li>
<li> ThermoBall retains 80% of its insulating power even when dampened by rain, humidity or sweat, so you'll continue to stay warm</li>
<li> Small baffles in shell fabric allow insulation to fully expand to retain body heat; highly compressible ThermoBall insulation offers warmth equal to 600-fill-power goose down</li>
<li> Tightly-woven nylon shell features square stitching that helps hold insulation in place to keep it evenly distributed; Durable Water Repellent finish repels light moisture</li>
<li> Bound cuffs and hood; low-profile internal hem drawcord; stow pocket</li>
<li> The North Face ThermoBall women's hoodie jacket features a very lightweight construction</li>
</ul>
