<h3>The REI Flash 65 women's pack sports a balanced mix of light weight, comfortable suspension and versatile features to keep you trail ready</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Removable framesheet, stays and top lid let you create a minimalist configuration for incredible weight savings</li>
<li> Minimalist configuration weighs a scant 2 lbs</li>
<li> Precurved hipbelt is designed specifically to fit a woman's contours; it cradles the hips for a natural fit and evenly distributes load weight without sagging</li>
<li> Hipbelt webbing system allows you to use a natural forward pulling motion for quick, easy cinching and precise adjustment</li>
<li> Hipbelt has a zippered pocket for on-the-go access to essentials such as snacks and lip balm; lash points on the other side let you attach a camera bag or GPS pouch</li>
<li> Precurved, dual-density padded shoulder straps match your anatomy for nonbinding comfort and stability</li>
<li> Back panel features mesh-covered, perforated foam for breathability and a fixed suspension system for low weight and easy use</li>
<li> Twin aluminum tubular stays and a precurved, perforated HDPE framesheet maximize structure and minimize weight</li>
<li> Under the lid, an over-the-top compression strap pulls the load in close to your back and provides a place for lashing on climbing ropes or other bulky items</li>
<li> Over-the-top compression strap has a thin storage pocket to stash a few small essentials; includes a key clip and a rip-and-stick closure to secure cash and ID</li>
<li> Deep, catch-all front pocket keeps large, often-used items within easy reach</li>
<li> 2 mesh pockets on each side hold water bottles and other stowables</li>
<li> Water-resistant zippers on top and front pockets and a rip-and-stick closure on the pocket underneath the lid allow you to safely store valuables away from the elements</li>
