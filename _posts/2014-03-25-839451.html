description_list: <h4>The Blizzard Cochise skis surf the powder, shred through crud
  and get you back to the lodge with a permanent grin</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Blizzard Cochise skis float high on powder, but they also turn with authority on
  groomers and wind-blown, sun-baked snow</li><li> Wood core is constructed like a
  sandwich, layers upon layers of CNC-milled strips reinforce each other to create
  a lightweight, snappy ski with smooth and easy handling</li><li> Fully rockered
  skis are constructed using a specialized technique called Flipcore that maximizes
  the natural flex of the ski materials</li><li> Instead of putting a ski together
  with standard camber and then pressing it into a rockered shape, Blizzard builds
  the skis into the finished shape before it is pressed</li><li> The standard shape
  of a cambered wood core is "flipped" upside down to naturally match the rockered
  shape of the finished skis</li><li> This results in equal and consistent pressure
  during construction and a noticeable difference how the skis perform</li><li> In
  brief, Flipcore rocker reduces the floppiness and chatter of skis on hard snow at
  high speeds and enhances the skis performance in soft snow</li><li> Dual titanium
  laminate increases snapiness and power underfoot</li><li> Sidewalls offer direct
  power transmission, resulting in quick side-to-side response</li><li> Requires bindings
  with wide brakes</li><li> Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
