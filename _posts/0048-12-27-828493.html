<h3>The waterproof, breathable shell fabric of this 3-season, premium women's REI Joule goose down sleeping bag keeps the downy warmth dry so you sleep like a baby</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Tested by an independent third-party lab using European Norm protocol, the EN temperature ratings allow direct comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags</li>
<li> Women-specific bags are cut to match a woman's shape, and provide extra insulation for enhanced warmth</li>
<li> Waterproof, breathable shell is an ultralight, coated ripstop nylon designed to dissipate moisture from the inside and repel moisture from the outside, keeping the down dry</li>
<li> 800-fill-power goose down is efficiently distributed for maximum warmth and compressibility; ultralight polyester mini-ripstop lining has a soft hand-feel</li>
<li> Exclusive REI Down Fill Calculator optimizes the amount of down per baffle for the most warmth with the least amount of down</li>
<li> 60% of insulation is put on top of bag where it contributes the most warmth and loft</li>
<li> In-the-round pattern wraps vertical baffles around perimeter of sleeping bag, from head to foot, creating a 3-dimensional bag that wraps you in warmth</li>
<li> Performance fit saves weight by reducing girth at shoulders, hips and lower legs while increasing thermal efficiency</li>
<li> Baffle spacing is optimized to keep down in place and prevent cold spots</li>
<li> Multi-chambered contour hood, insulated full-face muffler, puffy interior yoke, and full-length zipper draft tube with ground-level seams all work to keep heat in and cold out</li>
<li> Trapezoidal footbox mirrors sleeping position for thermal efficiency and room to move</li>
<li> External chest pocket keeps small essentials-headlamp, watch, glasses-right at hand and easy to find in the dark</li>
<li> Includes nylon stuff sack and large cotton storage bag</li>
<li> Differentiated drawcords (1 round, 1 flat) allow quick identification, even in the dark, so neck and hood adjustments are a cinch</li>
</ul>
