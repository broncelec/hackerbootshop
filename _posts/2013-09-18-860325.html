description_list: <h4>Built with easy-to-turn rockered tips and a versatile 83mm waist
  to handle bumps, trees, freshies or hardpack, the Volkl Yumi women's skis tackle
  any terrain on the mountain</h4><ul class="description"><li> Wide enough to float
  and narrow enough to remain nimble, the versatile 83mm waists give the Yumi skis
  excellent stability in any terrain</li><li> Slight rise in the tips makes it easy
  to start turning and offers forgiving stability in crud, and standard camber underfoot
  enhances maneuverability on groomed runs</li><li> Wood core uses lightweight and
  structurally sound balsa wood, creating a core that's lighter and more flexible
  than comparable unisex skis</li><li> With a vertically laminated core and vertical
  sidewalls, the Yumi skis turn easily from edge to edge and are responsive to aggressive
  turns at high speed</li><li> Tough Box construction sheathes the wood core in composite
  and fiberglass to remain durable during high speed landings and to snap back quickly
  from aggressive turns</li><li> Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
