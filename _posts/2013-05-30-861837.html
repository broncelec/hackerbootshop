description_list: <h4>All-mountain planks with eye-catching looks, SKILOGIK Ullr's
  Chariot RL skis use wide waists and rockered tips for soft snow and take on groomers
  with unusual grip for a rockered ski of its size</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Rockered tips are easy to maneuver and offer excellent flotation in soft snow, and
  the relatively tight sidecut radius offers the versatility to carve groomers</li><li>
  Construction consists of a hardwood core layered in a composite of carbon and fiberglass,
  topped with an eye-pleasing wood veneer that speaks to beautiful craftsmanship</li><li>
  Complementary wood cores ensure that your left ski and right ski have a matched
  flex pattern</li><li> Black locust hardwood sidewalls offer extra grip</li><li>
  The 101mm waists of the SKILOGIK Ullr's Chariot RL skis require wide brakes</li><li>
  Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
