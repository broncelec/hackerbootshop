<h3>Grab the REI Serrana women's down sleeping bag for all of your 3-season adventures</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> It's designed for the backpacker who prioritizes comfort over weight and wants a balance of performance and price</li>
<li> Women-specific bags are cut to match a woman's shape, and provide extra insulation and warmth in the hood and feet areas</li>
<li> Relaxed fit from the shoulders to the hips increases comfort by providing ample space to move around</li>
<li> 650-fill-power duck down is warm, lightweight and compressible</li>
<li> Exclusive REI Down Fill Calculator optimizes the amount of down per baffle for the most warmth with the least amount of down</li>
<li> 60% of insulation is put on top of bag where it contributes the most warmth and loft</li>
<li> Baffle spacing allows the down to remain fully lofted and keeps it from shifting, preventing cold spots</li>
<li> Ripstop polyester shell resists water and abrasion; smooth polyester taffeta lining is comfortable against your skin</li>
<li> Shell fabric is treated with a Durable Water Repellent finish to repel moisture and stains</li>
<li> Contoured hood, insulated full-face muffler, puffy interior yoke, roomy footbox and full-length zipper draft tube with ground-level seams all work to keep heat in and cold out</li>
<li> The REI Serrana down sleeping bag has an external chest pocket that keeps small essentials-headlamp, watch, glasses-right at hand and easy to find in the dark</li>
<li> Differentiated drawcords (1 round, 1 flat) let you adjust hood and neck easily in the dark</li>
<li> Full-length of zipper is backed by wide, antisnag binding tape</li>
<li> Any REI backpacking bag can be zipped to any other REI backpacking bag because of the consistent 63 in</li>
<li>, No</li>
<li> 5, YKK zipper; women's bags zip on the right, men's on the left</li>
<li> Pad loops provide attachment points to keep your sleeping bag and pad together to avoid rolling off onto the cold ground (straps and sleeping pad sold separately)</li>
<li> Includes stuff sack and storage bag</li>
