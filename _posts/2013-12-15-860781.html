description_list: <h4>Beefed up with a stiff metal laminate in the lightweight wood
  core, the advanced-level Atomic Blackeye Ti ARC skis with bindings offer stable
  81mm waists to roam the mountain at high speed</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Titanium laminate enhances stability and boosts performance at high speeds, and
  tip-to-tail wood core reduces swing weight and enhances overall handling</li><li>
  81mm waists carve responsively on hardpack, and they offer enough stability and
  flotation to have a good time off piste</li><li> When skis are weighted, there is
  a slight rise in the tips that makes it easy to initiate turns</li><li> When skis
  are put on edge after starting a turn, the camber flattens out to deliver full contact
  with snow and excellent edge hold</li><li> Half-cap construction in tips and tails
  improves durability, and sidewalls in binding area enhance edge grip by absorbing
  shock</li><li> Sidewall construction ensures maximum torsional rigidity, uncanny
  edge grip and controlled tip-to-tail flex; sidewall is reinforced in binding area
  with 2 layers of material</li><li> Integrated bindings allow the skis to flex naturally
  for excellent edge contact and bump absorption</li><li> Atomic Blackeye Ti ARC skis
  with bindings features DIN settings that adjust from 4 to 12, a range suited to
  advanced skiers at medium to high speeds</li><li> Base or topsheet color may vary
  from online photo</li></ul>
