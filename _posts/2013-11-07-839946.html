description_list: <h4>Find the deepest, freshest powder and charge in with the fully
  rockered Blizzard Bodacious skis</h4><ul class="description"><li> Although you can
  get back to the lifts on groomed runs with ease, the Blizzard Bodacious skis were
  made for deep powder snow</li><li> Wood core is constructed like a sandwich, layers
  upon layers of CNC-milled strips reinforce each other to create a lightweight, snappy
  ski with smooth and easy handling</li><li> Fully rockered skis are constructed using
  a specialized technique called Flipcore that maximizes the natural flex of the ski
  materials</li><li> Instead of putting a ski together with standard camber and then
  pressing it into a rockered shape, Blizzard builds the skis into the finished shape
  before it is pressed</li><li> The standard shape of a cambered wood core is "flipped"
  upside down to naturally match the rockered shape of the finished skis</li><li>
  This results in equal and consistent pressure during construction and a noticeable
  difference how the skis perform on hard snow</li><li> In brief, Flipcore rocker
  reduces the floppiness and chatter of skis on hard snow at high speeds and enhances
  the skis performance in soft snow</li><li> Dual titanium laminate increases snappiness
  and power underfoot</li><li> Sidewalls offer direct power transmission, resulting
  in quick side-to-side response</li><li> Requires bindings with wide brakes</li><li>
  Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
