description_list: <h4>The Blackburn Sideroller side entry water bottle cage uses a
  clever rotating chassis that lets you orient the cage opening to optimize bottle
  access on smaller or full-suspension bikes</h4><ul class="description"><li> Rotating
  cage of the Sideroller can be moved so that bottles can be removed outward 90deg
  to the left, right, or any angle between</li><li> Because the cage can be oriented
  so that bottles come out from either side, the cage works great for both lefties
  and righties</li><li> Made from tough alloy and polycarbonate for lasting use</li></ul>
