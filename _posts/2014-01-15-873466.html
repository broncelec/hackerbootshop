  new ThermoBall synthetic insulation</h4><ul class="description"><li> Warm and light,

  its insulating power even when dampened by rain, humidity or sweat, so you'll continue
  to stay warm</li><li> Small baffles in shell fabric allow insulation to fully expand
  to retain body heat; highly compressible ThermoBall insulation offers warmth equal
  to 600-fill-power goose down</li><li> Nylon taffeta shell features diamond stitching
  that helps hold insulation in place to keep it evenly distributed; durable water
  repellent finish repels light moisture</li><li> Nylon taffeta lining wicks sweat
  off your skin for quick evaporation, helping you stay dry and comfortable</li><li>
  Quickly stuff the vest into its own space-saving, left-hand stow pocket for compact
  storage</li><li> The North Face ThermoBall vest for women features zippered hand
  pockets, elastic arm-hole bindings, drawcord hem and a reflective zipper pull</li><li>
