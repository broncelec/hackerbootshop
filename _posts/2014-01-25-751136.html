  durability and newly shaped to eliminate rubbing and chafing against bare legs</li><li>

  protecting tubing from dings and scratches</li><li> Feet are now shod with a nonmarking,
  nonslip polymer for solid footing on smooth surfaces; oversize footprint reduces
  sinking into soft ground</li><li> Right-hand armrest still includes a mesh cup/bottle
