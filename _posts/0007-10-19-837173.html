  yarns on either side of the fabric to enhance comfort: interior yarn wicks moisture,

  than single-component fabrics such as cotton</li><li> Fabric offers UPF rating of
  30 to protect against harmful UV light</li><li> Flatseam construction is soft and
  non-chafing next to skin, and raglan seams are designed to work with pack straps

  chafing under a hipbelt</li><li> Additional length helps garment stay tucked in,
  and smooth texture of outer surface makes it easy to slide on extra layers</li><li>
