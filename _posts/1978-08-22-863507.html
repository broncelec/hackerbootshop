<h3>The North Face Oso hoodie offers active girls all the performance and style of the epic Denali jacket plus a hood for the perfect blend of style and comfort</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Incredibly soft polyester fleece dries quickly and resists pilling, and it keeps her warm without weighing her down</li>
<li> Reinforced shoulder panels repel light precipitation; tricot-lined pockets warm chilly hands</li>
<li> Elastic binding at cuffs, hood and hand pockets; partial elastic hem fits snugly around waist for moisture protection</li>
<li> Closeout</li>
</ul>
