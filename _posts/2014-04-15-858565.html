description_list: <h4>The men's Burton Imperial snowboard boots help you reign over
  the entire mountain</h4><ul class="description"><li> Cushioned soles and liners
  outfit your feet for all-day sessions where comfort and performance are key</li><li>
  Shrinkage(TM) technology reduces boot's overall footprint by 1 full size, minimizing
  boot overhang, bulk and weight</li><li> Super lightweight and resilient shell panels
  evenly distribute strap pressure to maximize rebound and resist breakdown; their
  flex remains consistent, season after season</li><li> Imprint(TM) 3 liners move
  with you for increased agility and response; rip-and-stick liner closures</li><li>
  Liners provide a consistent flex over time and slide on and off feet easily; precurved
  ankle panels reduce lace pressure on front of legs</li><li> Medium-flexing, slim,
  3D-molded tongues wrap the forefeet in comfort, offer a seamless flex and reduce
  performance-robbing shell/liner stack-up</li><li> Snowproof internal gussets on
  boot tongues completely seal lower boot zones to keep feet warm and dry</li><li>
  Streamlined Speed Zone(TM) shell lacing lets you fine-tune the upper and lower zones
  in seconds; this system offers powerful rebound, wrap and response with minimal
  effort</li><li> Molded EVA footbeds with supportive shanks lessen the blow of hardpack
  landings</li><li> Low-profile EST(TM) midsoles with a reduced ramp angle lower your
  center of gravity for improved boot feel; ultra-damping B3 gel inserts cushion without
  added weight</li><li> Vibram(R) EcoStep(TM) outsoles are made with recycled rubber
  and backed by nearly 70 years of mountaineering knowledge for superior traction,
  feel and light weight</li><li> Dual-density grippy rubber spikes dig into ice to
  help prevent slippage when off your board; durable toe material helps binding toe
  straps stay in place</li></ul>
