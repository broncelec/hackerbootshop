<h3>Slip the tough, light and compact REI V04 10 x 32 waterproof binoculars into your pack and pull the action in close with bright, clear image quality you'd expect to find in much more expensive optics</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Fully multicoated, anti-reflective lenses and dielectric coated prisms provide effective light transmission, even in low light</li>
<li> Roof-prism style creates a more compact design than traditional porro prism styles, making these binoculars light, small and easy to carry when hiking or backpacking</li>
<li> Long eye relief enhances viewing comfort by reducing eye strain regardless of whether user is wearing eyeglasses or not; twist-up eyecups let you use when wearing glasses</li>
<li> Excellent close focus ability allows user to enjoy a sharp view of images at a short distance</li>
<li> Shockproof, rubberized aluminum body stands up to rugged use in the field; binoculars are water- and fogproof thanks to sealed O-rings and nitrogen filling</li>
<li> The REI V04 10 x 32 waterproof binoculars include a carry case, neck strap and lens cleaning cloth</li>
</ul>
