<h3>Constructed with vertical movement in mind, the Litho T-shirt from The North Face has flat seams and a lightweight merino wool fabric that'll keep you comfortable when rock climbing or running</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> 19-micron merino wool is lightweight and soft; merino wool wicks moisture, dries fast and naturally resists odors</li>
<li> Zippered pocket is placed mid-torso for easy access</li>
<li> No-rise hem is cut slightly longer in back for good coverage</li>
<li> The North Face Summit Series(TM) apparel is designed and tested for use in harsh environments</li>
<li> Closeout</li>
</ul>
