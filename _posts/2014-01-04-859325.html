description_list: <h4>Designed to suit the big-mountain aspirations of hard-charging
  powder hounds, the K2 Annex 118 Seth Morrison Pro Model skis are stable, fast and
  ready for technical lines on the steepest terrain</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  118mm waists and rockered tips and tails designed for powder offer unparalleled
  performance in deep snow, and camber underfoot offers edge grip on the way back
  to the lifts</li><li> Lightweight and tough fir, maple and aspen wood core produces
  a natural flex, allowing the ski to achieve full contact with the snow throughout
  the turn</li><li> A fiberglass weave around the wood core provides torsional stiffness
  for highly responsive turning</li><li> The widest point of the tips is placed further
  back than on other K2 skis to reduce the tendency of skis to hook in light crust
  and throw you off balance</li><li> Slightly raised tails release easily during turns
  to reduce speed and avoid obstacles, and they make it easier to turn quickly when
  skiing concave-shaped couloirs and chutes</li><li> Use tip and tail holes to attach
  skins (sold separately); remove plugs with a flathead screwdriver</li><li> 118mm
  waist requires bindings with wide brakes</li><li> Base or topsheet color on the
  K2 Annex 118 Seth Morrison Pro Model skis may vary from online photo</li></ul>
