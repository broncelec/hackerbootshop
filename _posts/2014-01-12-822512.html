  to shape the insoles to your feet, providing a custom, supportive platform underfoot</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> Multiple layers of material work to support feet while
  a dynamic, impressionable foam molds to the shape of your feet without compromising
  stability or cushioning</li><li> Molding does not require the use of an external
  heat source-simply slide the Copper DMP insoles into your shoes and the they conform
  to your feet as you use them</li><li> 3/4-length polypropylene heel caps cradle
  heels, stabilize feet and provide arch support; reinforced midfoot area helps maintain
  midfoot flexibility</li><li> Smooth nylon topsheets help reduce friction and hot
  spots, and are treated with AgION(TM) antimicrobial treatment to help control odor</li><li>
  Recommended for low-impact activites; low profile makes these well suited to casual
  or tighter-fitting shoes</li><li> Superfeet Copper DMP premium insoles accommodate
  all arch types, though are ideal for low- to medium-arch feet</li></ul>
