<h3>The North Face Defroster Hoodie for men upgrades the classic fleece jacket to a whole new level with materials that dry quickly, pack small and fit snugly for optimal insulation</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Pontetorto hard-face fleece creates a durable outer face with an interior that insulates and wicks moisture; a touch of stretch ensures comfort and complete mobility</li>
<li> Strategically located FlashDry(TM) panels allow moisture-prone areas to dry quickly so you stay comfortable as long as possible</li>
<li> Hood fits close to the head to ensure helmet compatibility and comfort; extended collar and chin guard provide extra warmth and coverage during bad weather</li>
<li> 2 zippered hand pockets sit high on the torso to accommodate a harness or pack</li>
<li> Raglan style sleeve with off-the-shoulder seaming minimizes chafing and irritation when wearing a pack</li>
<li> The North Face Defroster Hoodie is part of The North Face Summit Series(TM), apparel designed and tested for use in harsh environments</li>
</ul>
