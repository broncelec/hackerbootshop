description_list: <h4>A minimally minded shoe, the Vasque Pendulum Trail-Running Shoes
  keep your feet close to the ground and optimally positioned for a natural forefoot
  strike on rugged trails</h4><ul class="description"><li> EVA midsoles and thermoplastic
  urethane plates protect you for the occasional heel strike or wayward stone</li><li>
  A bonded upper minimizes hotspots while a toothy outsole maximizes miles over sketchy
  terrain</li><li> 6mm heel-to-toe drop positions this shoe as a transition between
  a barefoot style and a traditional running shoe</li><li> Seamless uppers ensure
  a comfortable fit</li></ul>
