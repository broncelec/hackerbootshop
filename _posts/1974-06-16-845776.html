<h3>Inspired by tough hiking packs, the streamlined Hot Shot from The North Face efficiently stores gear while you're hitting the pavement around town or traveling in remote locations</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Large main compartment features an internal laptop sleeve (fits most 15 in</li>
<li> laptops); exterior zip pocket has a variety of organization compartments</li>
<li> Mesh side water bottle pockets keep hydration close-by (water bottles not included)</li>
<li> Adjustable, padded shoulder straps and padded back panel offer load-carrying comfort; polyethylene sheet along back adds structure and support</li>
<li> Padded, winged hipbelt enhances carrying support and stability, and stows it cleanly away when you don't need it; sternum strap further stabilizes the pack</li>
<li> The North Face Hot Shot daypack also has an integrated reflective light loop, a daisy chain to lash on gear and a webbing carry handle</li>
<li> Endorsed by the American Chiropractic Association (ACA)</li>
</ul>
