  700-fill-power goose down for a great warmth-to-weight ratio</li><li> Down is treated
  to resist moisture to maintain warmth; treated down stays drier 10 times longer,
  maintains 150% more loft and dries 30% faster than untreated down</li><li> Nautilus
  3D 6-baffle hood envelops your head in warmth; down gasket face muff allows hood
  to be cinched snug without digging into your face</li><li> Down-insulated draft

  to loft fully</li><li> Trapezoidal footbox is wider in the toe area and narrower
  in the heels to match the shape of your feet</li><li> Stretch tricot baffles allow
  the bag to be stuffed and unstuffed without tearing the baffle material</li><li>

  toss and turn at night</li><li> Marmot Meteor Sleeping Bag comes with a storage
  sack</li><li> European Norm (EN) is an independent third-party temperature rating,
  allowing accurate comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags</li></ul>
