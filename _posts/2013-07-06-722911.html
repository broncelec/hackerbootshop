description_list: <h4>This deep canoe pack can be loaded up with lots of food, yet
  it's small enough that it won't become too heavy to carry</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Pack refines the age-old portage pack design with an ergonomically cut harness system,
  sternum strap, arched lid and drawcord overflow</li><li> Updated design is now built
  with Cordura(R) nylon--it's every bit as strong as former material but much lighter</li><li>
  Ballistic nylon bottom offers excellent durability, no matter where you set pack</li><li>
  Padded hipbelt increases stability and comfort</li></ul>
