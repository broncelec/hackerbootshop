description_list: <h4>With a range of resistance suited to advanced cyclists, the
  CycleOps Fluid2 bike trainer offers quiet operation and a smooth, roadlike feel
  that helps you keep up your bike routine during bad weather</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  There are no manual adjustments needed, simply shift gears as you would when riding
  outside to increase or decrease the resistance, and the faster you pedal the harder
  it gets</li><li> Spin along with virtually no resistance or hammer out a 2000-watt
  sprint-you will never outgrow this trainer no matter what training you require</li><li>
  With a quick load cam lever, you simply adjust the resistance once and then lock
  it into place so there is no guessing each time you put your bike on the trainer</li><li>
  Combine this with a smooth, quiet ride, locking bolt ring and heavy-duty steel construction,
  and you're ready to sprint, spin and climb with confidence</li><li> The Cyclops
  Fluid2 bike trainer features adjustable foot pads, a quick release handle, self-cooling
  mechanism and folding legs for storage</li><li> Updated frame works with all standard
  wheels and now works with 29er mountain bike wheels (fits most treads to 2</li><li>25
  in</li><li>)</li></ul>
