description_list: <h4>No, you're not dreaming</h4><ul class="description"><li> The
  Marmot Plasma 15 Sleeping Bag comes in under 2 lbs</li><li> (regular length) with
  875-fill-power, water-resistant goose down-backpacking season can't get here soon
  enough! With a European Norm (EN) lower-limit rating of 18degF, the Plasma 15 sleeping
  bag is suitable for 3-season use and occasional winter outings</li><li> Filled with
  certified, super-lofty, ultralight, 875-fill-power goose down (the largest down
  cluster with the lowest trace of feather) for an unsurpassed warmth-to weight ratio</li><li>
  Down is treated to resist moisture to maintain warmth; treated down stays drier
  10 times longer, maintains 150% more loft and dries 30% faster than untreated down</li><li>
  Pertex(R) Quantum nylon ripstop shell is lightweight, durable and silky soft</li><li>
  Shell is treated with a Durable Water Repellent finish that causes moisture to bead
  up and roll off</li><li> Hood drawcord and insulated collar envelop your head and
  shoulders in warmth; down gasket face muff lets you cinch the hood snug without
  it digging into your face</li><li> Vertical baffles prevent cold spots by keeping
  the goose down fully lofted and in place</li><li> Down-insulated draft tube backs
  the two-way, full-length zipper to keep the cold out</li><li> Wrap-around footbox
  construction reduces down compression; Flow design with the classic trapezoidal
  foot box shape lets feet move freely and keeps down lofted for warmth</li><li> Zipper
  guard runs the entire length of the draft tube to prevent fabric from getting caught
  in zipper</li><li> Marmot Plasma 15 Sleeping Bag features an ultralight stuff sack
  and storage bag</li><li> European Norm (EN) is an independent third-party temperature
  rating, allowing accurate comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags</li></ul>
