<h3>The heavy-weight REI Quartz Peak fleece jacket is sure to keep boys warm during their cold-weather activities</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Thick, breathable fleece dries quickly, insulates even when damp and resists pilling; internal Teddy Bear fleece is extra soft and warm</li>
<li> 3-panel hood helps minimize the chill</li>
<li> Full-length front zipper features a chin guard at the top</li>
<li> Zippered hand pockets help keep hands toasty warm while a zippered chest pocket stows small essentials</li>
</ul>
