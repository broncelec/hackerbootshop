description_list: <h4>The reinvention of the auto-locking carabiner has arrived</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> The Black Diamond Magnetron GridLock Belay locking carabiner
  uses magnets for secure locking and unparalleled ease of use</li><li> With magnetic
  arms in the gate and a steel insert in the nose rather than a twistlock or screwlock,
  the Magnetron 'biner is simple to operate and totally secure</li><li> Both magnetic
  arms must be individually depressed before the gate can open, to prevent accidental
  openings</li><li> Once open, opposing magnetic fields repel the arms to ensure smooth
  and reliable gate operation</li><li> Symmetric design lets you open the gate easily
  with just 1 hand, either your right or left</li><li> GridLock design features an
  extension at the bottom of the gate to keep the 'biner properly oriented on your
  belay loop to avoid cross loading</li><li> I-beam spine transitions into a rounded
  rope-bearing surface for smooth belaying and rappelling</li><li> Hot-forging process
  allows the metal to be moved around and formed into intricate shapes; these shapes
  can ease handling and reduce weight</li><li> Black Diamond Magnetron GridLock Belay
  locking carabiner has a key lock nose that won't snag on pro, ropes or slings, making
  the 'biner simple to clip</li><li> Magnetic arms on the gate come in assorted colors
  only; sorry, specific color requests cannot be accommodated</li></ul>
