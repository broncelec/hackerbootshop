description_list: <h4>With rockered tips and tails for flotation on fresh snow and
  stable110mm waists to ski crusty snow weeks after the storm has passed, the Line
  Sick Day 110 skis are light, nimble and super fun</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Tip and tail rocker floats high in powder whether skiing forward or switch; relatively
  low rise planes through powder instead of plowing up and over</li><li> Core consists
  of light and strong maple wood stringers surrounded by aspen wood to provide power,
  stability and long-lasting responsiveness</li><li> Widest points of the tip and
  tail are close to the center of the ski, reducing tail drag and hooking in powder</li><li>
  Cap construction on top of ski reduces weight and sidewalls over the edges enhance
  responsiveness</li><li> Softer tips float and initiate turns easily while stiffer
  tails provide powerful turn exits and stability</li><li> Geometry of skis incorporates
  5 different turn radii to create effortless turn initiation with solid edge hold
  and responsive exits</li><li> Thin core in the tips reduces weight and makes the
  skis easier to control</li><li> Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li><li>
  Line Sick Day 110 skis feature 110mm waists that require bindings with wide brakes</li></ul>
