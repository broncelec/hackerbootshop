<h3>The North Face Freedom Low-Rise Boot-Cut Insulated women's snow pants allow easy motion on the move while standing up to winter temperatures</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Quiet and abrasion-resistant HyVent(TM) 2-layer coated nylon is completely waterproof, windproof and breathable; fully sealed seams prevent moisture seepage</li>
<li> Embossed taffeta lining and Heatseeker(TM) 60g polyfiber insulation keep you warm</li>
<li> Articulated knees aid in fit, allowing freedom of movement</li>
<li> Outer thigh vents and internal leg gaiters with stretch-mesh gussets work together to control airflow and regulate temperature</li>
<li> Warmth is regulated by allowing cool, dry air to flow in through mesh gussets while heated, moist air rises and exits upper thigh vents</li>
<li> Leg gaiters with elastic grippers seal out snow around boots and help regulate warmth</li>
<li> Features zippered handwarmer pockets and a single roomy cargo pocket</li>
<li> Rip-and-stick tabs at side of waist and zipper fly with snap closure secure the fit</li>
<li> Reinforced cuffs resist abrasion from boots, boards and skis</li>
<li> The North Face Freedom Low-Rise Boot-Cut Insulated women's snow pants feature a buddy lift clip to keep your pass close at hand</li>
