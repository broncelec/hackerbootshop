<h3>Whether you're hiking in cold weather, skiing, snowshoeing, or mountaineering, the REI Heavyweight Polartec(R) Power Dry(R) long underwear bottoms offer excellent value and warm comfort</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Polartec Power Dry uses two different yarns on either side of the fabric to enhance comfort, interior yarn wicks moisture and exterior yarn dries quickly</li>
<li> Combination of the two yarns helps keep you dry during highly aerobic activities by moving moisture away from your skin and drying more quickly single-component fabrics</li>
<li> Smooth surface of the outer fabric makes it easy to slide on additional layers</li>
<li> Flatseam construction is soft and non-chafing next to skin; brushed elastic waistband helps ensure a comfortable fit</li>
<li> Fabric offers a UPF rating of 50+ to help protect against harmful UV light</li>
<li> REI Heavyweight Polartec Power Dry long underwear bottoms feature a next-to-skin fit that hugs the body and moves with you</li>
<li> Closeout</li>
