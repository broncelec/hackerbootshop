<h3>The REI Kingdom 4 tent is a campground palace for families or couples</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> A center divider creates 2 private rooms, or you can roll the fly back to convert one room into an airy, bug-free haven</li>
<li> Vertical walls maximize livable space, and multiple pockets make easy work of organizing small gear and clothing</li>
<li> Rectangular floor plan makes it easy to arrange sleeping bags and gear</li>
<li> Stable, freestanding design with 2 hubbed pole assemblies, pole clips and sleeves is quick to set up</li>
<li> Advanced frame design maximizes headroom, interior volume and strength</li>

<li> Huge doors with 4 zipper sliders provide multiple entry options for both adults and children; doors tuck away into adjacent stuff pockets</li>
