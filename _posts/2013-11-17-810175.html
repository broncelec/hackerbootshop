description_list: <h4>The North Face VE-25 Tent is engineered to withstand the extreme
  conditions of high-altitude alpine environments</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  This 3-person juggernaut is still a perennial favorite with core mountaineers</li><li>
  Multiple exterior guy points, no-stretch Kevlar(R) guylines with cam adjusters and
  an internal guy system provide stability in extreme storms</li><li> Continuous pole
  sleeves increase structural integrity; DAC Featherlite(R) NSL poles slide through
  without snagging</li><li> 2 large doors allow easy access and good ventilation;
  2 vestibules for gear storage</li><li> Full-coverage rainfly includes pole-supported
  front vestibule with snowflaps and a stake-out rear vestibule for gear stowage</li><li>
  Internally adjusted mesh top vents ensure spindrift melts onto rainfly</li><li>
  Polyurethane windows, cold crack tested to -60degF, improve living conditions by
  increasing light and views</li><li> Taped, seam-tensioned true bathtub floor offers
  the clean angles and usable space of a catenary cut without requiring seam sealing</li><li>
  Waterproof, polyurethane-coated rainfly and floor provide superior protection and
  durability</li><li> Reflective guyline loops and zipper pulls help locate tent in
  the dark, minimizing the risk of tripping over guylines or kicking it loose</li><li>
  For a lightweight setup during nice weather leave tent body behind; use the rainfly
  and footprint (sold separately) with the poles and stakes</li><li> The North Face
  VE-25 Tent comes with DAC stakes with pull-cords and 4 fabric snow stakes</li></ul>
