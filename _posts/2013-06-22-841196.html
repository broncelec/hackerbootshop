description_list: '<h4>The Kneebinding Shadow downhill ski bindings offer an innovative
  solution to injury on the hill-a heel piece that releases sideways to reduce the
  chance of serious knee injury</h4><ul class="description"><li> Traditional bindings
  feature 2 areas of release: sideways toe release in the front of the boot and vertical
  or forward heel release at the back of the boot</li><li> Kneebindings offer an additional
  dimension of sideways release in the heel, reducing the chances of strains and tears
  to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL)</li><li> Resin and stainless-steel components
  offer high durability, excellent energy transfer and light weight</li><li> Mounting
  system is designed to work with the natural flex of your skis and to reduce unwanted
  release</li><li> Hard, flat boot platforms efficiently transfer pressure from edge
  to edge, and toe-height adjustment eliminates play</li><li> Wide mounting platform
  enhances leverage on today''s wide skis</li><li> The Kneebinding Shadow downhill
  ski bindings feature a 110mm brake that fits most all-mountain wide skis and some
  powder skis</li><li> Features 3 - 12 DIN settings</li></ul>'
