<h3>Bad with numbers? Our REI TSA Indicator Wordlock uses letters instead of numbers so you can set your own combination with an easily remembered word or expression</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Lock is recognized and accepted by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA)</li>
<li> TSA airport screeners have a secured set of keys to open Travel Sentry(TM) locks, allowing access without damaging the lock</li>
<li> Pop-up alert shows traveler if lock has been opened by TSA agents during inspection</li>
<li> Resettable 4-dial combination spells over 1,000 English words and expressions</li>
</ul>
