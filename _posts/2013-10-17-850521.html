description_list: <h4>Simply put, the Folbot Cooper 166 folding kayak takes the idea
  of a portable kayak to the next level, combining innovative design with high-quality
  materials to create one smooth ride</h4><ul class="description"><li> Maybe you can't
  store a hard-shell at home, or maybe you want the best paddling experience possible
  on an upcoming destination trip; either way, you'll want a Folbot</li><li> It sets
  up in about 15 - 20 min</li><li>, and folds up into a pack that you can store in
  your car's trunk or your gear closet</li><li> Thanks to a clever tensioning device
  in the rear of the kayak, you can first assemble the frame and then insert it into
  the skin, streamlining the set-up process</li><li> Designed for oceans, lakes and
  slow moving rivers, the Cooper offers excellent tracking and solid stability</li><li>
  Used by roofers, the military and whitewater-raft makers, a synthetic rubber material
  called Elvaloy is tough like a rhino's hide and protects the hull of the Cooper</li><li>
  Urethane-coated polyester protects the decks; all outer materials on the Folbot
  Cooper resist UV light and are designed to take a beating without puncturing</li><li>
  Frame of the Cooper is just as sturdy as its skin, with stainless-steel keel brackets
  (say that 3 times fast), aircraft-grade tubing and anodized aluminum cross pieces</li><li>
  Inflatable chambers called sponsons run the full length of the boat to increase
  tension and lock frame pieces into place; sponsons also flare out the hull to enhance
  stability</li><li> Seat and footpegs adjust to create a comfortable position in
  the cockpit</li><li> Easy-to-open zippers with high-strength zipper heads offer
  access to interior of kayak; rip-and-stick stormflaps and water-resistant closures
  keep things sealed up tight</li><li> Solid aluminum strip protects the bow and stern
  keels</li><li> What's included? Your kayak will come inside its backpack with skin,
  frame, 2 foot braces, 2 air sponsons, 2 safety bladders, and inflatable seat</li></ul>
