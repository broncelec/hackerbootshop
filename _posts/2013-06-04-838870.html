description_list: <h4>Hike up a sidecountry ridge for your turns in the Lange XT 130
  ski boots, then lock 'em down and ski as hard as you like</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Specialized ski/hike mechanism frees the upper shell from the lower part of the
  boot and offers a large range of motion for hiking</li><li> When you're ready to
  ski, the upper shell lock directly into the lower shell to maximize power transmission
  on the descent</li><li> Lange XT 130 shells are made from a single, uniform material
  to ensure that power transfer is highly efficient, even in varying temperatures</li><li>
  Single-material shells are also much easier for boot fitters to grind and punch</li><li>
  Shells are designed to create a centered, balanced stance using a low heel lift
  and an upright forward lean</li><li> Upright, natural stance makes it easy to stay
  balanced on today's shaped and rockered skis, reducing fatigue and increasing efficiency
  of skiing technique</li><li> Lange has created lightweight liners specifically designed
  for hiking; liners lace-up to ensure a comfortable fit while hiking</li><li> Liners
  comfortably conform to your feet and precisely match the internal shape of the shell
  to create instant responsiveness</li><li> Liners may be custom molded using a heat
  treatment</li><li> Boots hold to ankles and heels thanks to specialized, anatomic
  padding that resists packing out</li><li> Reinforced wedges in tongues remove gaps
  between liners and shells and enhance wrap on upper leg</li><li> Specially designed
  insteps provide excellent midfoot fit, resulting in heightened responsiveness, increased
  circulation and greater warmth</li><li> 1-piece toe boxes and tongues eliminate
  seams and overlaps in the tongue attachment area, reducing pressure points at the
  instep and top of the toes</li><li> You'll ski longer without hotspots thanks to
  the saddle-stitched seams in remainder of liners</li><li> Low-profile buckles sit
  low on the shell and creates a strong, precise closure</li></ul>
