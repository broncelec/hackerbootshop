description_list: <h4>Bring on the rough water! With the Werner Cyprus bent-shaft
  carbon paddle in your hands, maneuverability is simply a matter of putting the high-angle
  blades below the surface</h4><ul class="description"><li> Mid-size blades are designed
  with power and bracing in mind, yet are surprisingly easy to pull through the water
  during extended trips</li><li> High-quality, continuous-weave carbon fiber shaft
  delivers a superior strength-to-weight ratio</li><li> Bent shaft naturally aligns
  wrists, providing immediate comfort and reducing strain; a special grip area that
  fits the natural contour of your hand increases overall control</li><li> Smart View
  Adjustable Ferrule System allows elegant adjustment of feathering angle from 0deg
  - 60deg right or left in 15deg increments</li><li> Improved ferrule design eliminates
  external stickers by incorporating a small window which displays an internal printing
  of offset degrees</li><li> Low-profile button release makes paddle feel like 1 piece</li><li>
  Carbon fiber/foam core blades create a distinctive profile that enters and exits
  the water quietly while adding buoyancy for a light stroke</li><li> Blade design
  with ribless back smooths the sculling stroke and creates an elegant exit from the
  water</li><li> Pronounced dihedral power face reduces flutter to create exceptionally
  smooth, yet powerful, forward stroke</li><li> Asymmetrical shape reduces torque,
  allowing the paddle to pull smoothly through the water without the need for a tight
  grip</li><li> Remarkably light swing weight reduces overall fatigue on long paddling
  excursions</li><li> Drip rings help keep hands and lap dry</li><li> 2-piece design
  breaks down quickly and eases transport and storage</li><li> The Werner Cyprus kayak
  paddle is carefully handcrafted in Sultan, Washington, using a pressure molding
  process to achieve the right balance between weight and durability</li></ul>
