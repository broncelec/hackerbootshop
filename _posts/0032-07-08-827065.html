<h3>The women's REI Flash 52 pack sports a redesigned frame, hipbelt and back panel, combining ultralight materials with the comfort and performance you'd expect from a heavier pack</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Superior load transfer and stability allows you to comfortably carry hefty loads; it's achieved with a new perimeter frame and structured hipbelt, all with no added weight</li>
<li> Precurved shoulder straps match a woman's anatomy for nonbinding comfort and stability; perforated foam allows body vapor to pass through for improved comfort</li>
<li> Updated, fully structured hipbelt cradles the hips for a natural fit and offers impressive comfort and load transfer for an ultralight pack</li>
<li> Hipbelt webbing system lets you use a natural forward pulling motion for quick, easy cinching and precise adjustment</li>
<li> New molded, mesh-covered EVA back panel offers comfortable, ventilating performance that rivals heavier packs</li>
<li> New tubular aluminum perimeter frame provides excellent load support and stability while minimizing weight</li>
<li> Top-loading main compartment can also be accessed from a zippered opening at the bottom; floating top lid can be extended to create additional volume</li>
<li> Hydration pocket holds a reservoir of your choice (sold separately) for drinking water on the go</li>
<li> Floating front pocket maintains volume even when the main compartment is fully loaded; it offers convenient storage and allows more compressible gear to be stored behind it</li>
<li> Large mesh side pockets hold items for quick access</li>
<li> Hipbelt has zippered pockets on both sides for on-the-go access to essentials such as snacks and lip balm</li>
<li> Water-resistant zippers let you stash valuables away from the elements</li>
<li> Lightweight Speed Hook attachment points let you strap tools and bulky gear to the pack; quick-release straps at the bottom offer easy attachment of a sleeping bag or pad</li>
<li> Side compression straps help secure both large and small loads for increased stability</li>
</ul>
