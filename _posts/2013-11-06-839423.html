description_list: <h4>Named for the 22,205 ft</h4><ul class="description"><li> peak
  in Peru, the Dynafit Huascaran skis thrive at high speeds on steep, powder-filled
  slopes</li><li> Ultralight paulownia wood cores keep the skis light and exceptionally
  smooth on every turn; bamboo stringers increase core strength without adding cumbersome
  weight</li><li> Fiberglass and carbon laminate provides good torsional stiffness
  and lateral reinforcement without weighing the skis down</li><li> Rockered tips
  allow smooth, predictable turns in all types of snow; rockered tails have a low
  rise that makes them easy to disengage at the end of a turn</li><li> Patented titanal
  Dynafit Ski Insert System eliminates the need to drill your ski for Dynafit bindings
  (sold separately) and creates excellent ski-to-binding holding strength</li><li>
  Patented SpeedSkinFix attachment system securely attaches Dynafit skins (sold separately)
  to skis</li><li> SpeedSkinFix system does not interfere with the attachment of other
  brands of skins that feature a tip loop and tail clip</li><li> Dynafit Huascaran
  skis have a sintered graphite coating on the bases that enhances glide and improves
  wax retention</li><li> Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
