<h3>Designed for the coldest winter days on the slopes, the women's Powderflo gloves from The North Face have Gore-Tex(R) inserts, warm insulation and an articulated fit to keep your hands warm</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Heatseeker(TM) insulation on the palms and backs of hands has a great warmth-to-weight ratio, and is compressible and extremely durable, making them ideal for cold weather</li>
<li> Waterproof, highly breathable Gore-Tex inserts keep your hands dependably dry and comfortable</li>
<li> FlashDry(TM) fabric additive in the polyester lining dramatically improves drying time and breathability without adding weight or bulk or washing out</li>
<li> Removable wrist wraps inside the gloves are designed to hold hand warmer packets (sold separately) to warm blood as it flows to your hands</li>
<li> Women-specific 5 Dimensional Fit(TM) uses 5 measurements of the hand to construct gloves with an accurate and consistent fit</li>
<li> Radiametric Articulation(TM) improves warmth and blood flow to your fingers by mirroring the natural relaxed curve of the hand</li>
<li> The North Face Powderflo gloves have long gauntlet cuffs that cinch closed to keep snow out; use the ladderlock wrist cinches to keep heat in and adjust the fit</li>
</ul>
