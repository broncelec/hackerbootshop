  camber underfoot assists with grip on hardpack</li><li> Layered wood core designed
  specifically for advanced female skiers creates a lightweight, snappy ski with smooth
  handling</li><li> Fiberglass reinforcement laid in 4 separate directions increases
  snappiness and power underfoot</li><li> True twin profile provides equal responsiveness
  whether you're skiing forward or backward</li><li> Sidewalls direct power right
  to the edges of the skis, resulting in quick side-to-side response</li><li> 114mm
  waists require bindings with wide brakes</li></ul>
