description_list: <h4>This lightweight locking 'biner is constructed using an ISO
  Cold Forging process for an extraordinary strength-to-weight ratio</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Locking mechanism provides security against accidental opening, and locks to the
  gate, not the frame, to prevent jamming</li><li> Classic D shape carriers the loads
  off-center, toward stronger, non-gated side</li><li> Hooded gates offer smooth rope-bearing
  surfaces</li><li> Tapered nose for increased strength and spin rivets for smooth
  snag-free gate surfaces</li><li> Anodized coating won't flake off like paint, helps
  protect against corrosion and allows you to sort and identify gear easily</li><li>
  CE certified</li></ul>
