description_list: <h4>Medium-flexing, intermediate-level boots that personalize the
  fit with a custom-moldable shell, Salomon X Pro 100 ski boots offer high precision
  for steep terrain and fast turns</h4><ul class="description"><li> Custom-moldable
  shells adapt to your feet for a superior fit that eliminates pressure points and
  improves performance; requires specialized equipment best done by boot fitters</li><li>
  Two-part "Twinframe" construction is composed of a rigid lower shell for power transmission
  and precision and a more supple upper shell for comfort</li><li> Rigid lower shell
  provides power transmission where it's needed in the heels, along the sides of the
  feet and in the binding contact areas</li><li> More supple upper shell offers appropriate
  rigidity above the instep, in the progressively flexing cuffs and in the supportive
  and flexing backbone of the shell</li><li> Oversize 25mm pivot between bottom shell
  and upper cuff results in greater transmission and power distributed throughout
  the sole of the boot compared to typical 8mm pivots</li><li> Pre-shaped liners grip
  ankles and heels without too much pressure, and custom-moldable foam conforms under
  feet, over insteps and along shins for superior foothold</li><li> The Salomon X
  Pro 100 ski boots have a medium flex index of 100, providing the responsive power
  transfer appropriate for intermediate skiers</li></ul>
