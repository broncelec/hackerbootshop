<h3>Perfect for your next training session, the North Face GTD capri tights combine a great fit with light support</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> VaporWick(R) fabric seriously keeps up with hard-working pores, taking sweat from your skin and moving to the fabric's outer face for quick evaporation</li>
<li> Supportive fabric and back-of-the-knee mesh panels keep hard-working muscles comfortable when it's go time</li>
<li> Silver-salt treatment at gusset fights odors so you don't have to worry about funky tights</li>
<li> Elastic waist with drawstring ensures a comfortable fit</li>
<li> Need to stash some extra fuel for that last mile? A rear zippered pocket holds small items and minimizes their shifting around</li>
<li> The North Face GTD capri tights feature reflective highlights that increase visibility in low light</li>
</ul>
