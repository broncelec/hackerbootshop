<h3>The REI Fall Line 35 snow pack is your ticket to untracked powder</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Sized right for day trips, the main compartment provides room for probe, skins, food, safety essentials and extra layers of clothing</li>
<li> Front zippered pocket is sized for a shovel blade, and it features a sleeve for the handle</li>
<li> Tarpaulin liner in pocket resists moisture and abrasion</li>
<li> Zippered back panel entry lets you access your gear and hydration reservoir (not included), even with your skis or board attached</li>
<li> Back panel material sheds snow and dries quickly</li>
<li> Skis carry diagonally across the front of the pack, and snowboards and snowshoes carry vertically down the center; straps tuck away</li>
<li> Padded front panel and tough reinforcement patches prevent damage from skis and snowboards</li>
<li> Mesh sling zips out to carry your helmet on the trip up and tucks away when not in use; redesigned sling offers access to tool pocket while your helmet is attached</li>
<li> Hydration pocket is designed to accept most hydration reservoirs, not included</li>
<li> Insulated sleeve on shoulder strap stores the hydration hose to help prevent freeze-up and is large enough to accommodate right-angle shut-off valves</li>
<li> Lightweight spring steel frame supports a gear-heavy outing, and it responds well to the movement of skiing and riding</li>
<li> Hipbelt snugs comfortably to help distribute weight to your hips, not your back; hipbelt features 2 pockets for easy access to small items</li>
<li> Hipbelt webbing system adjusts with a forward pull, creating a secure, ergonomic fit</li>
<li> Compression straps help stabilize gear for security and comfortable carriage</li>
<li> Snow-specific buckles are designed to work well with gloves on and to prevent clogging with snow</li>
</ul>
