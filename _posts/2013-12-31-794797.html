description_list: <h4>The 3-season REI Lumen synthetic sleeping bag features amazing
  compressibility and warmth while balancing price and performance</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  With a European Norm (EN) lower-limit rating of 27degF, this bag is suitable for
  3-season use</li><li> Synthetic Thermawave polyester insulation is durable and highly
  compressible; synthetic polyester fill retains some insulating properties even when
  wet</li><li> Shingle construction with overlapping layers distributes insulation
  evenly and keeps it from moving around so there are no cold spots</li><li> Equally
  distributed insulation accommodates the multi-position sleeper; mummy shape is thermally
  efficient, yet roomy enough to ensure sleeping comfort</li><li> Ripstop nylon shell
  fabric has a nice hand feel, is lightweight, durable, water- and abrasion resistant;
  nylon taffeta lining is soft and tear-resistant</li><li> Relaxed fit through the
  shoulders and hips gives you room to move for a better night's rest</li><li> Contoured
  hood, insulated full-face muffler, roomy footbox and full-length zipper draft tube
  with ground-level seams work together to keep heat in and cold out</li><li> External
  chest pocket keeps small essentials-headlamp, watch, glasses-right at hand and easy
  to find in the dark</li><li> Special pocket in hood can be stuffed with clothing
  layers to make a pillow that stays in place; no need for a pillow to take up valuable
  space in your backpack</li><li> Pad loops provide attachment points to keep your
  sleeping bag and pad together, so you needn't worry about rolling onto the cold
  ground (straps sold separately)</li><li> Full length zipper is backed by wide, antisnag
  binding tape</li><li> Differentiated drawcords (1 round, 1 flat) allow quick identification,
  even in the dark, so neck and hood adjustments are a cinch</li><li> Nylon stuff
  sack and cotton storage bag included</li><li> European Norm (EN) is an independent
  third-party temperature rating, allowing accurate comparisons across brands with
  other EN-rated bags</li></ul>
