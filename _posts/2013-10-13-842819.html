description_list: <h4>The Burton Sherlock snowboard solves the mysteries of the deep,
  untracked pow</h4><ul class="description"><li> Take this board out on a freshie-filled
  day and enjoy the ride</li><li> Sherlock is built for riders who don't hesitate
  to pick their own lines; it's a shock-absorbent, all natural jib and jump machine
  that floats like a dream</li><li> Flying V(TM) is a premium blend of camber and
  rocker, and offers the best of both worlds in terms of performance</li><li> Rocker
  overall, and between and outside the feet, enhances catch-free playfulness and float
  through pow</li><li> Subtle camber zones underneath feet focus edge control for
  crisp snap, added pop and power through the turns</li><li> Directional twin shape
  offers the freestyle feel of a twin board but is slightly tweaked to provide improved
  float and control through variable terrain and conditions</li><li> Surface area
  at the tip and tail contact points is lengthened to improve edge-hold, and allows
  the board to plane easier in powder</li><li> The Channel system offers unlimited,
  on-the-fly stance adjustability, enhances board feel and is compatible with EST(TM),
  Re:Flex(TM) and Disc(R) bindings</li><li> The Channel lets you fine-tune your stance
  width to the millimeter, and then dial in your toe-to-heel centering and rotate
  your angles in 1 fell swoop</li><li> Wood core is light, snappy and responsive;
  engineered wood grain positioned along the toe and heel edges, perpendicular to
  the core, improves edge hold and strength</li><li> Lightweight Carbon I-Beam(TM)
  riding up the board's spine adds to board's longitudinal snap</li><li> Fiberglass
  in the topsheet provides versatile flex and response so you can shred everything
  from big mountain descents to laps in the park</li><li> Tapered tip and tail thickness
  reduces swing weight and improves powder flotation</li><li> Meaty 10:45 sidewalls
  optimize 2 different angles to absorb impact for aggressive riders</li></ul>
