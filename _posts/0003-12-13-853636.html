<h3>Our men's REI Winterflyte Wind tights keep you comfortably pushing the pace on the Nordic ski trails thanks to stretchy, windproof fabric on the front of the pants and breathable rear fabric panels</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Front polyester fabric blocks wind, resists water and breathes well while providing the mobility of 4-way stretch</li>
<li> Breathable rear fabric panels behind knees dry quickly and wick moisture to enhance comfort when you're working hard in the cold</li>
<li> Durable Water Repellent finish causes water to bead up and roll off, fending off light rain showers and snow</li>
<li> Cuffs are designed to fit snugly over cross-country and skate-skiing boots to ensure a comfortable fit, and zippers make getting tights on over boots easy</li>
<li> Low-profile, elastic waist delivers a comfortable fit and features an adjustable drawcord</li>
<li> Flatlock seams are designed for optimal motion and to reduce chafing</li>
<li> The men's REI Winterflyte Wind tights also feature reflective details to increase your visibility in low light</li>
<li> Active fit moves with your body for a full range of motion</li>
</ul>
