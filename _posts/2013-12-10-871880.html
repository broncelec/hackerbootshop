  Spray Skirt is designed for moderate paddling conditions</li><li> It helps keep
  water out of your kayak's cockpit while protecting your legs from harsh sunlight</li><li>
  Midweight nylon packcloth is coated with polyurethane for excellent water resistance</li><li>
  Strong bungee rim gripping system firmly secures skirt to cockpit coaming</li><li>
  Front webbing grab loop with handle assists with entry and wet exits</li><li> Tensioned
  deck stay creates a convex bend in fabric so water runs off, rather than collecting
  and pooling on top of the skirt</li><li> Water-resistant zipper that starts at the
  waistband and ends at the deck stay makes it easy to put the skirt on quickly</li><li>
  Zipper also makes accessing items in the cockpit possible without having to undo
  the skirt from the coaming</li><li> Removable elastic shoulder straps secure skirt
  and keep tunnel tensioned; neoprene waist has adjustable rip-and-stick sides for
  a custom fit</li><li> Mesh deck pockets store small essentials for quick access</li><li>
  Double-stitched construction with sealed seams ensures long-lasting wear and water
  resistance</li></ul>
