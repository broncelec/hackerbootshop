description_list: <h4>The Line Pollard's Paint Brush adjustable ski poles are the
  tools you need to launch tricks with signature style in the terrain park then plant
  turns in deep powder thanks to their adjustable length</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Durable aluminum construction makes the poles feel light in hand</li><li> Sticky
  grip won't slip as you charge boxes, rails and kickers</li><li> 25mm strap features
  a rip-and-stick adjustment</li><li> Tabs on top of grips fit into your hands between
  your thumbs and first fingers and make 5-finger grabs a bit more manageable</li><li>
  When conditions change from packed to powder, switch out the smaller, 60mm baskets
  for larger, 90mm baskets by simply screwing them off the pole</li><li> Graphics
  on the Line Pollard's Paint Brush adjustable ski poles are designed by skier, artist
  and filmmaker Eric Pollard</li></ul>
