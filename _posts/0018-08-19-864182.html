<h3>Pull on the warm, waterproof Sopris ThermoBall booties from The North Face for your daily adventures through the snowy, wet streets</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Functioning like down feathers, the tiny round clusters of ThermoBall spun polyester insulation trap warm air, while softly conforming to your body's shape</li>
<li> ThermoBall retains 80% of its insulating power even when dampened by rain, humidity or sweat, so you'll continue to stay warm</li>
<li> Waterproof velvet suede and water-resistant recycled PET polyester fabric uppers keep your feet dry on rainy and snowy days</li>
<li> Plush fleece lining adds warmth</li>
<li> Cushioned, lightweight injection-molded EVA outsoles</li>
<li> EVA outsoles have inset TNF Winter Grip(TM) rubber in the center for tenacious traction in wet, slick conditions</li>
<li> Temperature-sensitive Ice Pick(TM) rubber lugs on outsoles harden when temps fall below freezing, providing extra bite into the terrain</li>
</ul>
