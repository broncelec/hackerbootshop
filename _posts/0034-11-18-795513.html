<h3>Built to handle heavy loads with all the creature comforts, the newly updated REI Mars 80 pack handles extended backpacking in any season</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Precurved shoulder straps match your anatomy for nonbinding comfort on and off the trail</li>
<li> With a "rip-and-stick" torso adjustment, shoulder strap system easily slides along pack's frame to fit torsos of varying lengths</li>
<li> Dual-density foam padded back panel provides a comfortable and supportive fit when carrying heavy loads</li>
<li> Precurved hipbelt is designed to cradle hip bones for a natural fit and to distribute weight without sagging</li>
<li> Hipbelt webbing system allows you to use a natural forward pulling motion for quick, easy cinching and precise adjustment</li>
<li> Enjoy dual access to pack via the top-loading opening and the horseshoe-shape, zippered front panel opening, which works like a duffel opening</li>
<li> Removable top lid pocket with water repellent zipper lets you stash the essentials you want to bring into tent; pack can stay outside or in vestibule</li>
<li> Zippered pocket under lid stores maps and keys, spare batteries and other small essentials</li>
<li> Front panel features a new and improved stretch-woven zippered pocket with easy access for packing often-used gear</li>

<li> Utilizing 4 buckles, the pack's streamlined compression system lets you cinch and strap down loads for jostle-free carrying</li>
<li> Concave head pod at the top of pack gives your head freedom of movement-no more staring at the ground</li>
<li> 2 mesh side pockets hold water bottles, energy bars and other essentials you want close at hand</li>
