description_list: <h4>The Look Pivot 14 XXL bindings are designed to enhance your
  performance, increase your safety and create an unparalleled connection with your
  skis</h4><ul class="description"><li> Why settle for less?</li><li> Remember last
  year when you hit a small bump, your ski randomly popped off, and you went down
  like a freight train?</li><li> To prevent such mishaps, Look has engineered key
  features into the binding to reduce premature release, the most innovative of which
  is a rotating heelpiece</li><li> Look calls it the Turntable heel, and it rotates
  with the boot directly under your tibia, creating consistent and reliable release</li><li>
  Pivot also features 40mm of elastic travel at the toe and 25mm at the heel which
  absorbs shock and allows a lower setting of release values</li><li> Look has reduced
  the space between where the heelpiece and toepiece are mounted on the ski, increasing
  responsiveness</li><li> 3 contact points between the bindings and the heels ensure
  effective power transfer</li><li> 72mm anti-friction device increases leverage and
  control, especially on wide skis</li><li> 117mm brake fits most all-mountain wide
  and some powder skis</li></ul>
