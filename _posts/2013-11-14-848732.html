description_list: <h4>The Boreas Lagunitas 25 pack boasts an innovative variable suspension
  that morphs from close-fitting stability to off-the-back, trampoline-like ventilation-perfect
  for biking or hiking</h4><ul class="description"><li> With a simple push at the
  top and the pull of a strap, effortlessly switch from a highly ventilated, trampoline
  suspension to a more conventional and stable fit</li><li> Adjusting the gap between
  the pack and your back is like adjusting a thermostat-bigger gap, more cooling airflow;
  smaller gap, more warmth and stability</li><li> Supportive, ventilated shoulder
  straps and back panel distribute pressure evenly with resilient foam that maintains
  its volume, even under a heavy load</li><li> Aluminum and steel hoop frame effectively
  transfers load weight to your hips; lightweight webbing hipbelt is removable</li><li>
  Top-loading main compartment features a lid with a completely waterproof top pocket
  for wallets, phones and other items that react to water like the Wicked Witch of
  the West</li><li> Organize often-used items with dual zippered side pockets and
  a tuck-away daisy chain; hydration sleeve and port enable on-the-go hydration (reservoir
  sold separately)</li><li> Lightweight, 210-denier ripstop pack fabric is impregnated
  with silicone for water-resistant durability that thwarts the tendency to wear out
  or rub off over time</li><li> The Boreas Lagunitas 25 pack incorporates stretch
  panels that allow the pack body to expand and curve, depending on the load and suspension
  setting</li></ul>
