<h3>With a tailored fit, great ventilation and wind- and water-resistant fabric, The North Face Better Than Naked jacket for men is an ultra-lightweight running shell that performs like a second skin</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Lightweight ripstop polyester is used on panels on the front and back to create a barrier against wind; polyester and mesh maximize breathability in remainder of jacket</li>
<li> Panels feature FlashDry(TM) fibers to dramatically improve dry time and breathability</li>
<li> Durable Water Repellent finish helps light precipitation bead up and roll off</li>
<li> An updated fit creates a tailored silhouette with body-mapped ventilation to increase airflow to the back of the jacket and ensure maximum breathability</li>
<li> Zippered security pocket stows small items and works with your media player; rear pocket is easy to access with either hand</li>
<li> Reflective highlights are visible from any angle and increase your visibility in dim light</li>
<li> Dropped tail extends rear coverage</li>
<li> The North Face Better Than Naked jacket for men is part of the Flight Series(TM), developed by The North Face and tested by outdoor athletes</li>
<li> Closeout</li>
