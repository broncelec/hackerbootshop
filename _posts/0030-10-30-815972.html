<h3>The REI Mistral women's petite pants are sleek and multipurpose soft shells</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Have them on hand for late-autumn hikes when the days turn cool and wet</li>
<li> Water-resistant nylon/polyester/spandex blend withstands rugged use and remains windproof to 25 mph; because the fabric dries quickly, you won't feel chilled or clammy</li>
<li> 4-way-stretch fabric, articulated knees and center gusset let you move comfortably</li>
<li> Jeans-style waistband, zipper fly and bonded belt loops; rise sits approximately 1 - 2 in</li>
<li> below belly button</li>
<li> No waistband side seams; offset inseams prevent irritation and enhance comfort</li>
<li> 10 in</li>
<li> leg zippers help pants slide easily over footwear</li>
<li> 2 zip hand pockets and 2 rear zip pockets</li>
<li> REI Mistral pants feature an active fit that provides a full range of motion</li>
</ul>
