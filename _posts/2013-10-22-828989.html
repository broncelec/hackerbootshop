description_list: <h4>Keen Harvest MJ shoes offer truly unique, one-of-a-kind style
  with each pair, thanks to construction that uses repurposed fabric scraps</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> Uppers use recycled cotton-either reclaimed rice bags or
  repurposed fabric scraps-for distinct, fun style; instep strap crosses foot for
  a secure fit</li><li> More subtle than other Keen shoes, but still there-patented
  rubber Toe Guards protect feet from scuffs, bumps and uneven sidewalks</li><li>
  Cotton canvas linings are soft against bare feet</li><li> Removable polyurethane
  footbeds act as the midsoles to provide cushioning and comfort for all-day wear</li><li>
  Low-profile, nonmarking natural rubber outsoles on the Keen Harvest MJ shoes supply
  good, all-around traction</li></ul>
