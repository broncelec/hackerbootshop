  the terrain park, Nordica The Ace Junior ski boots offer the shock-absorbent features
  of adult boots in a smaller size</h4><ul class="description"><li> Nordica The Ace
  Junior ski boots feature a 3-piece shell construction that makes it easy to get
  feet into boots</li><li> Boots flex lightly at first, then as you put greater pressure
  on tongues during the turn, the resistance increases and enhances precision</li><li>

  Middle buckles clamp down on feet at a 45deg angle to keep heels securely seated
  and increase comfort in the forefeet</li><li> Shock-absorbent technology helps kids
  hone their park-and-pipe skills while staying comfortable</li><li> Additional padding
  in the tongues and cuffs absorbs shock and damps vibrations, making the ride smooth
  and easy</li><li> Kids' liners feature soft padding and warm fleecy linings</li><li>
  Loops on tongues aid in putting the boots on and taking them off</li><li> Flex index
  of 90 offers resistance appropriate for young skiers</li></ul>
