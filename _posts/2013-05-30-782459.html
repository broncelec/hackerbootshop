description_list: <h4>Updated to provide greater comfort, efficiency and ease of use,
  the Petzl Ascenion ascender is great for aid climbing, mountaineering or caving</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> Updated molded grip features a more ergonomically shaped
  handle that provides greater comfort than the previous version; grip is over-molded
  with rubber for greater friction</li><li> Large index finger indent increases efficiency
  when pulling on the ascender</li><li> Chrome-plated, spring-loaded steel cam features
  angled teeth and a self-cleaning slot to securely grip the rope, even in wet, muddy
  or icy conditions</li><li> Cam has been refined to glide more easily along the rope,
  requiring less effort during long sessions of jugging</li><li> Open/close trigger
  is now recessed inside the ascender's frame to avoid accidentally opening the cam
  while in use; trigger can still be operated with 1 hand</li><li> Safety catch prevents
  the cam from opening too far, thereby keeping the rope captured</li><li> Includes
  multiple attachment points to allow for different uses, such as self-belaying or
  hauling</li><li> Anodized frame is color coded for easy identification; black ascender
  is for the left hand and gray is for the right</li><li> Designed for use with ropes
  between 8 and 13mm in diameter</li></ul>
