description_list: '<h4>Use the men''s REI Midweight Polartec(R) Power Dry(R) Zip-T
  for hiking, skiing, snowshoeing or Nordic skiing and enjoy the warmth and comfort</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> Polartec Power Dry utilizes 2 different yarns on either
  side of the fabric to enhance comfort: interior yarn wicks moisture, and exterior
  yarn dries quickly</li><li> Combination of the 2 yarns helps keep you dry during
  highly aerobic activities because it moves moisture away from skin faster than single-component
  fabrics such as cotton</li><li> Fabric offers UPF rating of 30 to protect against
  harmful UV light</li><li> Center front zipper allows ventilation control</li><li>
  Flatseam construction is soft and non-chafing next to skin, and raglan seams are
  designed to work with pack straps at shoulders</li><li> Underarm and side gussets
  promote freedom of motion and reduce chafing under a hipbelt</li><li> Additional
  length helps garment stay tucked in, and smooth texture of outer surface makes it
  easy to slide on extra layers</li><li> The men''s REI Midweight Polartec Power Dry
  Zip-T features a next-to-skin fit that hugs the body</li></ul>'
