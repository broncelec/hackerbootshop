<h3>Made from a smooth fleece sweater fabric, the REI Tofino jacket combines great style with functional warmth</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> This cool-weather essential won't spend much time in your closet</li>
<li> Polartec(R) Thermal Pro(R), sweater-knit fleece is dense without being bulky; it's breathable, repels light wind and has a water-resistant, non-pilling outer face</li>
<li> Cozy tunnel collar with one exterior button keeps your neck warm, and the brushed lining is soft next to your skin</li>
<li> Exterior and interior wind flaps prevent cold spots at the front zipper</li>
<li> REI Tofino fleece jacket has 2 zip handwarmer pockets and 2 drop-in interior pockets</li>
</ul>
