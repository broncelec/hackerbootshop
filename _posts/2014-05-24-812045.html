description_list: <h4>The MTI underDOG Flotation Vest for dogs positions most of its
  buoyancy under the chest area, supporting a dog's natural swim posture and making
  its instinctive swim motions more effective</h4><ul class="description"><li> Traditional
  flotation vests pull dogs' hindquarters up and position their heads closer to the
  water; underDOG releases the neck and lets the head ride higher above the water</li><li>
  4 adjustment points, ventilated mesh across the back and an adjustable mesh bridge
  between the collar and the body help ensure great fit and comfort</li><li> Reflective
  trim accents the sides and top for enhanced visibility in low light; reinforced
  carry handles and leash attachment point help you keep your dog under control</li><li>
  The MTI underDOG Flotation Vest for dogs is made of durable nylon and Cordura(R)
  fabric in the same factory that makes MTI life jackets for people</li></ul>
