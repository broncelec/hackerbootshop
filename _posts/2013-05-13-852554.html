description_list: <h4>Most coolers come away from a life full of adventure with cracked
  corners, caved-in lids and busted hinges</h4><ul class="description"><li> Not the
  Yeti Tundra 65</li><li> It's built tough to take the abuse that comes with the way
  you play</li><li> Rotomolded polyethylene construction, the same process used to
  make whitewater kayaks, ensures excellent impact resistance and long-lasting durability</li><li>
  Extra-thick walls contain proprietary PermaFrost(TM) insulation that is pressure
  injected, giving the cooler excellent resistance to outside temperatures</li><li>
  Yeti coolers are designed to handle extremely low temperatures and are compatible
  with dry ice; dry ice provides about 3 times the cooling power of regular ice</li><li>
  Tundra 65 cooler has a 57</li><li>6-liter capacity (61 qt</li><li>) that will hold
  39 cans and plenty of ice; designed to accommodate long-neck bottles</li><li> Tundra
  lid doesn't just close, it seals shut with a freezer-quality gasket around the entire
  lid to minimize air exchange</li><li> Durable rubber T-latches fit in the molded
  latch keepers on the cooler to ensure the lid stays closed</li><li> Interagency
  Grizzly Bear Committee has certified the Tundra 65 as a bear-resistant food container
  when used with 2 padlocks (sold separately) on both front corners</li><li> Tie-down
  slots are molded into the cooler body for solid mounting in your boat or truck;
  cooler can be secured while allowing access to the inside; straps sold separately</li><li>
  Full-length, rustproof aluminum rod connects and holds the body and lid together;
  hinge stops are molded in the lid so the hinge will never break</li><li> Screw-in
  gasketed drain plug won't leak; partially unscrew the plug to drain water</li><li>
  Haul handles on the ends are designed to make carrying a loaded cooler easier for
  2 people; textured grips are secured with marine-grade nylon rope</li><li> Use the
  Integrated recessed handles when you're carrying the cooler by yourself</li><li>
