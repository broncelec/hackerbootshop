  welded seam construction (not sewing) that doesn't pinch the insulation, maximizing

  stabilizes the fill without sewing through the bag, eliminating moisture penetration
  points and maximizing loft</li><li> Insulation is laid in a wave shape, enhancing
  loft and increasing thermal efficiency; offset welds increase stability and loft</li><li>
  Slightly wide cut gives you extra room to move inside the bag; Comfort mummy cut

  ripstop nylon shell provides durabilty; 40-denier polyester taffeta lining breathes
