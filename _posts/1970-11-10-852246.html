<li> PrimaLoft One is a patented ultrafine microfiber blend that offers downlike softness, and is incredibly lightweight and water repellent</li>
<li> ZLoft technology integrates strips of PrimaLoft One into a Z-baffle construction, which eliminates the cold-leaking stitching holes found in conventional baffles</li>
<li> Hood and shoulders have a polyurethane coating to increase water resistance</li>
<li> Harness- and pack-friendly handwarmer pockets; zippered Napoleon pocket; adjustable hem</li>
<li> Hidden hem cinch-cord at center front zip</li>
