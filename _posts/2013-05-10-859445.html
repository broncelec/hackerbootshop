  boots offer intermediate-level stiffness and a low-volume fit with narrow lasts</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> Shells, liners and narrow, 97mm footbeds are based on a
  composite scan of thousands of skiers' feet for anatomic accuracy and comfort</li><li>

  efficiency of technique and reduce fatigue</li><li> Control Fit liners conform to
  your feet for a comfortable, high-performance fit; liners may be custom molded using
  a heat treatment</li><li> Uniform-density plastic shells ensure highly efficient
  power transfer, smooth flex and finely-tuned responsiveness, even in frigid temperatures</li><li>
  Women-specific fit with anatomically shaped liners and upper cuffs accommodates
  narrow heels and low calf muscles</li><li> Liners comfortably contour your feet
  and precisely match the internal shape of the shells to create instant responsiveness</li><li>
  Specially designed insteps provide an excellent fit at the midfoot, resulting in
  increased circulation and greater warmth</li><li> 1-piece toe boxes and tongues
  eliminate seams and overlaps in the tongue-attachment areas to reduce pressure points
  at the insteps and tops of the toes</li><li> Soft flex index provides a power transfer
  suited to new intermediate skiers looking to expand their skills</li></ul>
