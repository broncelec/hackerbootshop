  side of the fabric to enhance comfort: interior yarn wicks moisture, and exterior

  promote freedom of motion and reduce chafing under a hipbelt</li><li> Additional
  length helps garment stay tucked in, and smooth texture of outer surface makes it
  easy to slide on extra layers</li><li> The men''s REI Midweight Polartec Power Dry
