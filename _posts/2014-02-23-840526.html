description_list: <h4>When the tracked-out runs are all too familiar, and you know
  there's powder over the far ridge, the women's Salomon Quest 100 ski boots offer
  you the option of hiking for your turns</h4><ul class="description"><li> Specialized
  ski/hike mechanism frees the upper cuff from the lower part of the boot and offers
  enough movement to comfortably hike to untouched stashes</li><li> When you're ready
  to ski, the cuffs lock directly into the lower shell to maximize power transmission
  on the descent</li><li> Innovative V-shaped lower shell and magnesium backbone virtually
  eliminate flex when backbone is engaged</li><li> Waterproof fabric along the sides
  of the tongues helps keep feet dry, even when hiking in deep powder</li><li> Women-specific
  liners feature upper cuffs that are shaped around women's calf muscles, a wide forefoot
  area and low volume around the ankles</li><li> Comfortable liners feature a layer
  of custom-moldable foam that personalizes the fit around the ankle and shin</li><li>
  Moisture-wicking layers of mesh, foam and insulation in liners efficiently transfer
  chilling sweat away from feet</li><li> Liners disperse more moisture than standard
  liners, helping keep feet dry and warm</li><li> Closed-cell foam under the boot
  boards softens hard landings</li><li> Single canting sets cuffs to a different forward
  lean angles depending on how aggressively you ski</li><li> Rubber soles offer excellent
  traction on slippery surfaces</li><li> With a flex index of 100, Salomon Quest 100
  ski boots provide a power transfer suitable for advanced skiers</li></ul>
