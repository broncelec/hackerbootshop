description_list: <h4>Burton Ruler snowboard boots will handle the entire mountain</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> With stabilizing backstays, oversize airbag cushions and
  Speed Zone(TM) lacing, these boots give you a comfortable, dialed-in fit</li><li>
  Powerful backstay spines increase both medial and lateral support, edge-to-edge
  response and durability</li><li> Strategically placed flex notches allow smooth,
  fluid lateral and medial flex, perfect for nose bones and tweaked out tail grabs</li><li>
  Streamlined Speed Zone shell lacing lets you fine-tune the upper and lower zones
  in seconds; this system offers powerful rebound, wrap and response with minimal
  effort</li><li> To make entry and exit easy, Burton added a pull loop on the tongue
  as well as a lace pull tab that releases both the upper and lower zones simultaneously</li><li>
  Imprint(TM) 2 liners feature soft faux-fur linings and rip-and-stick closures for
  a comfortable, close fit</li><li> Medium-flexing, slim, 3D-molded tongues wrap your
  forefeet in comfort, offer a seamless flex and reduce performance-robbing shell/liner
  stack-up</li><li> Snowproof internal gussets on boot tongues completely seal lower
  boot zones to keep feet warm and dry</li><li> Shock-absorbing air bags cover approximately
  75% of the midsoles for a pillowy ride and protection without the weight</li><li>
  Grippy rubber spikes supply that extra edge when traveling across slippery terrain</li><li>
  Shrinkage(TM) technology reduces boot's overall footprint by 1 full size, minimizing
  boot overhang, bulk and weight</li></ul>
