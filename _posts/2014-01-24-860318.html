description_list: <h4>Made for the fluffiest of the fluffy, the Volkl Kuro skis feature
  super-wide 132mm waists, a stabilizing titanium laminate in the core and a deeply
  rockered profile to take on the deepest powder</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Full rocker increases maneuverability in deep snow, making turns in powder effortless
  and giving the skis a surflike, floaty feel</li><li> The smooth, gradual rocker
  from tip to tail also creates uninterrupted edge contact on groomed runs so you
  can maneuver these jumbo powder skis back to the lifts</li><li> Low tip reduces
  chatter on groomed runs and resists diving in soft snow</li><li> Multilayer wooden
  core uses dense ash under the bindings to ensure screws won't come loose during
  harsh landings; soft poplar elsewhere makes the skis snappy and responsive</li><li>
  Tough Box construction sheathes the wood core in composite and fiberglass to remain
  durable during high speed landings and to snap back quickly from aggressive turns</li><li>
  Titanium laminate in the core stabilizes the ride and further, enhances stability
  and allows advanced skiers to ski as aggressively as they want</li><li> Stiff flex
  zone in front adds stability, and medium flex underfoot transitions to the soft
  tail that aids in turning on groomers and maneuvering in pow</li><li> Directional
  twin tip heavily favors skiing forward but allows you to ski and land jumps backward
  if needed</li><li> Volkl Kuro skis require bindings with wide brakes</li><li> Base
  or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
