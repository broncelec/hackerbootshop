description_list: <h4>Made especially for the U</h4><ul class="description"><li>S</li><li>
  armed forces, this rugged pen can write nearly anywhere, on nearly anything</li><li>
  Replaceable pressurized ink cartridge continuously feeds ink to the tungsten carbide
  ball, allowing pen to write at any angle--even upside down</li><li> Thixotropic
  ink writes smoothly and dependably on most surfaces, even under water, on photographs,
  in freezing cold, extreme heat and in space! Stainless steel, precision-machined
  socket prevents leaks and oozing yet delivers uniform ink flow</li><li> Revolving
  ball liquefies the ink so that it writes more smoothly, more dependably and longer
  than most pens</li><li> Medium point, black ink</li></ul>
