description_list: <h4>With stiff laminates in the core to smooth the ride, the advanced-level
  Rossignol Temptation 88 women's skis use tip and tail rocker to readily take an
  edge on groomers and shred through soft snow</h4><ul class="description"><li> Poplar
  wood core creates light and lively skis that transmit the feel of the snow and put
  you in touch with the terrain, and stiff basalt laminates reduce vibrations</li><li>
  Varying shapes of laminates reduce the weight of the tips, making them easier to
  control</li><li> Layered laminates in tips also smooth out turn initiation, improve
  edge contact during turns and increase side-to-side response</li><li> Subtle rocker
  in tips and tails offers easy steering in any snow conditions, and traditional camber
  underfoot provides tenacious edge grip</li><li> Extended sidecut continues beyond
  the rockered tips and tails, providing full engagement of ski edges during turns
  at high speeds and easy maneuverability at low speeds</li><li> Vertical sidewalls
  deliver excellent power transfer for superb grip on hardpack snow</li><li> Base
  or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
