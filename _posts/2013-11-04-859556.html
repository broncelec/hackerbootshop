description_list: <h4>From boxes to rails to cliffs in the backcountry, the Line Dart
  ski poles get the job done right with a mountain-bike style grip and a freestyle-friendly
  design</h4><ul class="description"><li> The Line Dart ski poles feature durable
  aluminium poles that feel light in the hands</li><li> Thin, sticky grips won't slip
  as you charge the terrain park</li><li> Tabs on top of grips fit into your hands
  between your thumb and first finger and make 5-finger grabs a bit more manageable</li><li>
  When conditions change from packed to powder, switch out the smaller, 60mm baskets
  for larger, 90mm baskets by simply screwing them off the poles</li></ul>
