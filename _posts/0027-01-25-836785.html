<h3>A great performer in stormy weather, the REI Havenpass Earflap cap with eVent(TM) fabric has earflaps that fold down for added protection from the cold</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> eVent fabric has a unique membrane that allows sweat vapor to escape to the outside of the fabric in 1 easy step</li>
<li> No matter how hard you work, overheating is highly unlikely due to this Direct Venting(TM) technology</li>
<li> PrimaLoft(R) insulation in the crown and earflaps keeps your head warm; it's also water resistant and quick drying</li>
<li> Polyester microfleece lining wicks moisture away and dries quickly</li>
<li> Baseball-style cap with a shaped, stiffened brim channels rain away from your face and shields your eyes from sun; brim is 2</li>
<li>625 in</li>
<li> long</li>
<li> Bungee with cordlock lets you adjust the fit of the cap</li>
<li> Earflaps snap up on the sides of the REI Havenpass Earflap cap when not needed</li>
</ul>
