description_list: '<h4>The women''s REI Traverse Shocklight trekking poles provide
  quiet stability and support so you hear the sounds of nature and not the clicks
  of your poles</h4><ul class="description"><li> Women-specific design is lighter
  weight and shorter, and features a smaller grip than its unisex counterpart</li><li>
  Shock-absorbing poles reduce fatigue while improving stability; lockout mechanism
  creates a rigid pole when needed for more efficient climbing</li><li> Shocklight
  shock absorbers weigh less than common spring-loaded mechanisms and won''t rattle
  within the shaft as you walk</li><li> Internal twist-lock mechanisms apply a wide
  area of pressure against pole walls to lock in length adjustment</li><li> With the
  Stop Lock system, poles won''t come apart; system makes the pole sections into 1
  unit for security and stability</li><li> Twist-locking pole sections let you tailor
  the length to fit your terrain: make them shorter for the way up, longer for the
  way down</li><li> Strong 7075-T6 aluminum 3-section telescoping poles extend to
  a maximum length of 49</li><li>2 in</li><li> and compact to 26 in</li><li> for easy
  storage and transport</li><li> Soft EVA foam hand grips are sized for a woman''s
  hands and have an ergonomic, contoured shape that is easy to hold; adjustable padded
  neoprene wrist straps add support</li><li> Fitted with trekking discs and extra-durable
  tungsten carbide tips; included tip protectors are strictly for travel/packing protection,
  not intended for hiking</li></ul>'
