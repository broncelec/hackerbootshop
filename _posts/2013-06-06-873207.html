description_list: <h4>The Rossignol BC 65 Positrack Backcountry Skis are lightweight,
  metal edge touring skis designed for off-trail exploring or on-trail use</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> Designed primarily for off-trail light backcountry use,
  but will track nicely on-trail as well (for those spending about 70% of their time
  off-trail and 30% on-trail)</li><li> Wood with air channel core construction creates
  structural spines, adding torsional rigidity while reducing weight</li><li> Waxless
  Positrack bases provide maximum grip and a good compromise between kick and glide
  in all snow conditions</li><li> Rossignol BC 65 Positrack Backcountry Skis have
  full-length metal edges and a taller camber height than some backcountry skis for
  off- and on-trail versatility</li></ul>
