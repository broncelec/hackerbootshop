<h3>Adding a little substance and increased breathability to a lightweight waterproof shell, the North Face Resolve rain jacket keeps comfort a priority with an interior mesh lining</h3>
<ul class="description">

<li> Mesh knit lining promotes breathability and helps moisture move away from the skin</li>
<li> Attached, adjustable hood can be rolled up and stowed inside the collar; 2 zippered front pockets secure small essentials</li>
<li> The North Face Resolve rain jacket features rip-and-stick cuff adjustments and hem cinch cord to allow for a snug fit that seals in warmth</li>
</ul>
