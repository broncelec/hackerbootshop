  where removing a water bottle in the typical "forward and up" motion is difficult</li><li>
  Made of a lightweight and strong composite, the cage features sturdy side "ribs"
  along with top and bottom lips to securely hold a variety of bottles over rough
  terrain</li><li> Lezyne Flow SL water bottle cage is also available as a right-side-loading
  version (see related items)</li></ul>
