description_list: '<h4>Built for skiers who explore serious terrain, the Pieps DSP
  Pro avalanche transceiver is packed with features: a 60m range, a high-tech transmitter
  and a marking function for multiple burials</h4><ul class="description"><li> Three-antenna
  system pinpoints the location of burials within a 60m range regardless of antenna
  orientation and burial depth</li><li> In a multiple-burial scenario, the unit works
  to transmit a signal without overlapping other signals</li><li> Eliminating signal
  overlap allows the searcher to quickly interpret the audible and visual information
  with increased accuracy and less confusion</li><li> Digital Signal Processing (DSP)
  technology displays the number of buried victims as stick figures on an easy-to-view
  LCD screen</li><li> When signals are detected, the approximate distance and direction
  to the burials are displayed-simply follow the arrows to reach a burial</li><li>
  Upon locating the position of the first victim, the searcher can mark and mask the
  found signal and immediately begin searching for other burials; marks up to four
  signals</li><li> Includes an inclinometer so you can accurately measure slope angles,
  helping you navigate through potential avalanche terrain</li><li> Pieps DSP Pro
  can measure frequency deviation of all transceivers, a great pre-ski tour test to
  conduct</li><li> Scan function quickly gives an overview of all buried devices within
  the detectable range</li><li> Self-check tests all major functions as the transceiver
  is powering on, including transmitting frequency and operation of antennas, amplifiers,
  processors and batteries</li><li> Adjustable, nylon harness with pouch keeps the
  unit secure and accessible</li><li> Compatible with all transceivers operating on
  the 457 kHz frequency</li><li> Can be used with Pieps iProbe (sold separately);
  iProbe can temporarily suppress the signal of a transmitting Pieps transceiver to
  make searching for multiple burials easier</li></ul>'
