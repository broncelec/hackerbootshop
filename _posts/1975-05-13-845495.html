<h3>The North Face Kings Canyon 3 tent is a roomy, freestanding backpacking tent big enough for basecamp, but rugged enough for backcountry exploration</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> 2 doors with 2 vestibules offer private entries and personal gear storage</li>
<li> Double-hubbed poleset, crossing ridge pole and combination-diameter pole sizes maximize interior volume and provide a dry entrance</li>
<li> Color-coded webbing and poles make setup quick and easy</li>
<li> Lightweight and strong DAC Featherlite(R) NSL poles with press-fit connectors use an anodization process that lessens environmental impact</li>
<li> Twist-clips make pitching and disassembly easy and fast, and save weight</li>
<li> High-low ventilation design harnesses convection and cross-flow to help expel moisture vapor and prevent interior condensation</li>
<li> Lightweight silicone- and polyurethane-coated high-tenacity nylon rainfly material is rugged and weatherproof; fully taped bathtub floor prevents leaks through seams</li>
<li> Convenient overhead pockets stow headlamps and fragile items; also features abundant gear loops</li>
<li> Reflective guyline loops, guylines and glow-in-the-dark zipper pulls make life easier at night</li>
<li> As a convenient option, poles and rainfly can be set up with the footprint (sold separately) to create a lightweight shelter</li>
<li> The North Face Kings Canyon 3 tent comes with stuff sacks, DAC tent stakes and guyline/tighteners</li>
</ul>
