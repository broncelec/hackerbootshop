description_list: <h4>The Vans Aura snowboard boots are a foundation style in the
  Vans lineup</h4><ul class="description"><li> They maintain classic styling with
  a soft, forgiving flex, lightweight construction and zonal Boa(R) lacing</li><li>
  This season, the Vans Aura boots feature new outsoles that provide a slimmer profile
  and reduced weight over last season</li><li> Double Boa lacing has two reels that
  control two specific zones of closure; the tongue dials the upper portion of the
  boots while the side-mounted dial adjusts lower portion</li><li> Boa lacing offers
  on-the-fly micro adjustments and never comes untied; you get quick on and off, and
  consistent closure without pressure points</li><li> Full instep articulation allows
  the upper and lower zones of the boots to flex independently, creating a fluid forward
  motion and minimizing shell distortion</li><li> Trifit X thermal-formable liners
  with asymmetric heel-holding inserts feature closed-seam fleece upper cuffs, comfort
  flex toe boxes and low-volume soles</li><li> Open-cell foam interior cushioning
  layer adds plush comfort</li><li> Molded EVA high-rebound footbeds feature integrated
  arch support, anatomically placed dual-density metatarsal and heel impact-relief
  pads, and antimicrobial linings</li><li> Internal web harnesses hold liners closed
  for secure fit and prevent them from slipping inside shells; lace locks maintain
  desired tension</li><li> Low-profile soles work with the integrated liner construction
  to shorten the boots' footprint, thus decreasing toe and heel drag</li><li> Inverted
  waffle tread pattern design delivers a functional snow-specific spin on the classic
  Vans waffle sole</li></ul>
