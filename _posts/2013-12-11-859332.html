description_list: <h4>Looking for a fast, responsive ride on groomed runs? The K2
  Superific women's skis feature rockered tips and a lively feel perfectly suited
  to intermediate skiers looking to get aggressive</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Rockered tips initiate turns easily and offer agile performance on all kinds of
  terrain, and slight camber underfoot offers tenacious edge hold on firm snow</li><li>
  K2 women's skis reduce the bulk and weight of all components to create very lightweight
  skis suited to the specific needs of female skiers</li><li> Bioflex1 core combines
  aspen, paulownia and bamboo woods to create a lightweight ski that is stable at
  speed with a soft, forgiving flex</li><li> A fiberglass weave around the wood core
  provides torsional stiffness for highly responsive turning; a shock-absorbent secondary
  core smooths out your ride</li><li> Integrated binding system allows the skis to
  flex fully from tip to tail for smooth turn initiation, hold and release</li><li>
  Integrated bindings are shorter, lighter and more flexible than the men's equivalent,
  generating serious power and precision for female skiers</li><li> K2 Superific Skis
  with bindings feature DIN 3 - 10 release settings, a range suited to beginning and
  intermediate women skiers at medium to high speeds</li><li> Base or topsheet color
  may vary from online photo</li></ul>
