description_list: <h4>Beefier than the Gorillapod SLR, this heavy-duty unit attaches
  to SLR cameras with zoom lenses or to video cameras, and can support over 6-1/2
  pounds! Unlike traditional tripods, the Gorillapod SLR-Zoom doesn't require an elevated
  flat surface for you to take the perfect shot</h4><ul class="description"><li> An
  adaptable screw (from 1/4 to 3/8 inches) lets you mount a digital SLR or a tripod
  head of your choosing</li><li> Flexible joints bend and rotate 360 degrees to form
  the perfect shape</li><li> Ring and foot grips work on most surfaces, providing
  extra holding power</li></ul>
