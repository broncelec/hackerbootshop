<h3>Stay at low camp or high camp in the REI Expedition -20degF sleeping bag featuring goose down insulation, a water-resistant/breathable shell and a double zipper system for temperature fluctuations</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Unique double zipper system allows you to adjust comfort as needed-fully close both zippers to increase warmth, open inner zipper to decrease warmth</li>
<li> Goose down is efficiently distributed for maximum warmth and compressibility-800-fill-power goose down on top and 700-fill-power goose down underneath</li>
<li> Exclusive REI Down Fill Calculator optimizes the amount of down per baffle for the most warmth with the least amount of down</li>
<li> Ultralight ripstop nylon shell fabric was specifically designed to dissipate moisture from the inside, as well as repel moisture from the outside, keeping the down dry</li>
<li> In-the-round pattern wraps vertical baffles around perimeter of sleeping bag, from head to foot, creating a 3-dimensional bag that wraps you in warmth</li>
<li> Baffle spacing is optimized to keep down in place and prevent cold spots</li>
<li> Multi-chambered hood and anatomically-contoured, insulated draft collar seal in heat; trapezoidal footbox mirrors sleeping position for room to move and thermal efficiency</li>
<li> A pass-through pocket with zipper access on both outside and inside provides a convenient way to get to your stashed essentials such as eyewear and headlamp</li>
<li> Includes nylon stuff sack and large cotton storage bag</li>
</ul>
