<h3>The North Face Boundary Triclimate 3-in-1 insulated and waterproof jacket for boys steps up to handle all kinds of changes in the weather-no need to come inside for extra layers! Boys can combine the shell jacket and liner jacket for maximum protection, or wear either piece alone as conditions warrant</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Fully seam-sealed polyester shell jacket uses HyVent(TM) 2-layer coating for waterproof, breathable protection</li>
<li> Detachable hood is fully adjustable to ensure a weather-blocking, personalized fit</li>
<li> Body features a smooth mesh lining to wick away moisture and ease layering</li>
<li> Shell jacket features a powder skirt, drawcord hem, detachable hood, rip-and-stick cuffs, zippered handwarmer pockets, chest pocket, internal media pocket and goggles cloth</li>
<li> Zip in/out polyester liner jacket uses 150g Heatseeker(TM) Aero polyfiber insulation to keep him warm without inhibiting mobility</li>
<li> The North Face Boundary Triclimate 3-in-1 insulated jacket's zip-in attachment system secures liner and shell together while preserving access to the shell's interior features</li>
</ul>
