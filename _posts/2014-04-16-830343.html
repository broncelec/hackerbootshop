description_list: <h4>The MSR WindPro(TM) II backpacking stove maintains the efficiency
  and versatility of the original WindPro while adding the ability to burn inverted
  fuel canisters for cold-weather performance</h4><ul class="description"><li> Easy
  to operate-no priming, pre-heating or pressurizing is necessary; attach an isobutane-propane
  canister and start cooking (canister not included)</li><li> Includes a stand for
  inverting isobutane-propane canisters for better cold weather performance and more
  consistent output over the life of each canister</li><li> At only 6</li><li>6 oz,
