description_list: <h4>The Full Tilt Mary Jane women's ski boots blast through intermediate-level
  terrain and keep you happy with their one-of-a-kind flex, roomy 102mm width and
  women-specific cuffs</h4><ul class="description"><li> 3-piece shell includes separate
  cuff, shell and tongue sections that come together to create a classic fit</li><li>
  Shell design allows the use of thin plastic to reduce overall weight, and ensures
  an even flex pattern with specialized tongues</li><li> 5 ribs (separate sections)
  on tongues provide an even, uniform flex, and cables work like shoelaces to even
  out pressure and reduce shin bang</li><li> Tongues hinge out of the way making it
  a breeze to get your feet into the boots</li><li> Women-specific cuffs match a woman's
  anatomical lower calf shape, and women-specific lasts are designed for your feet
  and ankles</li><li> Liners feature 7mm medium-density foam that molds to your feet
  through use, but they can also be custom molded using a heat treatment at an REI
  specialty ski shop</li><li> An additional 4mm layer of foam, as well as spacious
  toe boxes, enhance warmth and comfort</li><li> Shock-absorbent bootboards reduce
  the jarring impact of big-air landings and smooth out vibrations at high speed</li><li>
  Full Tilt Mary Jane ski boots provide the responsive power transfer preferred by
  intermediate skiers; Full Tilt rates the flex as a 4 out of 10</li><li> 102mm footbeds
  provide a great fit for wide feet</li></ul>
