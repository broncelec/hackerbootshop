description_list: <h4>The Dalbello Sherpa 5/5 randonee boots provide all the power
  needed to drive the widest skis, yet they are lightweight and allow great range
  of motion for long backcountry tours</h4><ul class="description"><li> 3-piece Cabrio
  shell design ensures a precise foothold and a smooth, progressive flex as you bend
  your knees into the turn</li><li> Separate cuff, shell and tongue sections are joined
  together to create a smooth forward flex with rigid lateral support</li><li> Double-hinge
  tongues combine with Twin Hinge ski/walk mechanisms for great range of motion while
  touring; when flexed forward on descents, the 2 tongue pieces lock together</li><li>
  Lightweight liners can be custom molded for an accurate fit; use the laces to really
  dial in the fit</li><li> See an REI ski shop professional to have the liners custom
  molded to your feet to maximize comfort and performance</li><li> Hinge points on
  the cuffs are placed about 10cm lower than most randonee boots and are designed
  to allow the boots to follow the natural movement of your legs</li><li> Tech components
  in front and back give the boots Dynafit-style binding compatibility; Sherpa boots
  are also compatible with step-in style randonee bindings</li><li> 3 microadjustable
  aluminum buckles on each boot secure your feet in place; Dynalink instep closures
  do not allow your feet to slide forward or lift inside the shells</li><li> Boots
  have a forefoot width of 100mm</li><li> Dalbello Sherpa 5/5 randonee boots have
  lugged Vibram(R) rubber outsoles for good traction on snowy slopes and rocky trails</li></ul>
