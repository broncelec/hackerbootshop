description_list: <h4>Made for first-time competitive skaters and those who like to
  get out for regular winter exercise, the Fischer CRS NIS skate skis offer lively,
  lightweight performance and longlasting durability</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Lightweight wood with air channel core and Air Core material keep the overall weight
  light; core construction stiffens the skis for a lively response and enhances durability</li><li>
  Volcanic basalt fibers are added to the core to ensure a consistent flex in all
  temperatures</li><li> Reinforced lateral edges enhance the skis' durability over
  time and even out pressure distribution for uniform wax wear</li><li> Graphite bases
  retain wax well for good glide</li><li> Universal stone ground bases glide well
  in all snow conditions</li><li> Movable bindings (sold separately) click securely
  into Nordic Integrated System (NIS) plates; quickly adjust binding position to adapt
  to snow conditions or terrain</li><li> NIS uses a factory-bonded plate, eliminating
  screws that can compromise flex</li></ul>
