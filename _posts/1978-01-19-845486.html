<h3>Suited for mild weather and weighing in at only 1 lb</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> 4 oz</li>
<li> (regular length), the Hightail 2S sleeping bag from The North Face won't slow you down on light and fast adventures into the mountains</li>
<li> With a lower-limit European Norm (EN) rating of 35degF, the Hightail 2S is a great bag for lightweight adventures in mild conditions</li>
<li> Premium 850-fill-power goose down is highly compressible and offers a superior warmth-to-weight ratio</li>
<li> Pertex(R) Endurance(TM) fabric is used on the head, collar and footbox to keep moisture from seeping in</li>
<li> Trapezoidal side baffles are constructed to trap insulation and prevent it from shifting to eliminate cold spots</li>
<li> Footbox allows natural foot movement while also eliminating excess lateral space so you stay warm and comfortable all night long</li>
<li> Fitted hood with drawcords lets you seal in warmth; when it's cold enough to cinch down the hood, the down-insulated draft collar snugs comfortably and holds in warmth</li>
<li> Insulated draft tube backs the zipper to prevent warm air from escaping; anti-snag tape keeps the zipper from catching on the draft tube</li>
<li> Full-length, 2-way zipper lets you make adjustments for ventilation</li>
<li> No more fumbling with the zipper in the middle of the night thanks to the glow-in-the-dark zipper pull</li>
<li> Internal zippered pocket is a great place to keep your watch so you'll hear the alarm go off early in the morning</li>
<li> The North Face Hightail 2S sleeping bag comes with a stuff sack and storage bag</li>
<li> European Norm (EN) is an independent third-party temperature rating, allowing accurate comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags</li>
</ul>
