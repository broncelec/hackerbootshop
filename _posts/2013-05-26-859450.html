  backcountry, the Look XM 13 S C100 randonee bindings let you go from the resort

  stability while skiing</li><li> Bindings include 100mm wide brakes to fit your wide
  all-mountain skis</li><li> Flip the climbing bars up with a ski pole to take some
  stress off your legs when you're skinning uphill; two different positions let you
  choose the height that works for you</li><li> Look XM 13 S C100 randonee bindings
