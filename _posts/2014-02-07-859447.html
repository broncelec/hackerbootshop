description_list: <h4>Combining a medium, intermediate-level flex with roomy footbeds,
  the Lange SX 90 W women's ski boots emphasize precision as you take on steeper terrain
  and faster turns</h4><ul class="description"><li> Roomy, 102mm footbeds offer a
  comfortable fit and can accommodate wide feet</li><li> Medium flex index provides
  a power transfer suited to aggressive intermediate skiers looking to expand their
  skills</li><li> Uniform-density plastic shells ensure highly efficient power transfer,
  smooth flex and finely-tuned responsiveness, even in frigid temperatures</li><li>
  Shells are designed to create a centered, balanced stance on rockered skis to increase
  efficiency of technique and reduce fatigue</li><li> Liners comfortably contour your
  feet and precisely match the internal shape of the shells to create instant responsiveness;
  they may be custom molded using a heat treatment</li><li> Women-specific fit with
  anatomically shaped liners and upper cuffs accommodates narrow heels and low calf
  muscles</li><li> 1-piece toe boxes and tongues eliminate seams and overlaps in the
  tongue-attachment areas to reduce pressure points at the insteps and tops of the
  toes</li><li> Specially designed insteps provide an excellent fit at the midfoot,
  resulting in increased circulation and greater warmth</li><li> The Lange SX 90 W
  women's ski boots feature saddle-stitched seams to help reduce hotspots</li></ul>
