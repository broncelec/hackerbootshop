description_list: <h4>Built with 114mm waists, the Rossignol Super 7 skis charge freshly
  fallen powder with surfy rockered tips and tails and a lightweight, honeycomb construction
  that makes them easy to turn</h4><ul class="description"><li> Please note that these
  skis do not include bindings</li><li> The Super 7 skis are right at home lapping
  freshly fallen powder or blasting through crud, but they also carve well on hardpack
  snow and groomed runs</li><li> Float like a feather on top of deep snow thanks to
  the rockered tips and tails; redesigned Powder Turn rocker minimizes the tendency
  of tips to flap at high speeds</li><li> Easy-to-turn honeycomb tip and tail are
  significantly lighter than previous models; you can actually see the light pass
  through the air-filled spaces in the honeycomb</li><li> You'll really appreciate
  the weight savings when the Super 7 skis are strapped to your pack and you hike
  up the ridge to get first tracks</li><li> The responsive strength of the skis shines
  when dropping into steep terrain, negotiating a technical line, and straight-lining
  it back to the base</li><li> Standard camber underfoot offers tenacious edge-grip
  on hardpack; there's more than enough camber to enjoy carving on groomers</li><li>
  The Super 7 skis feel extra smooth, especially at high speeds, thanks to the visco
  elastomer in the tip and tail that absorbs shock and resists chatter</li><li> 114mm
  waists require bindings with wide brakes</li><li> Base or topsheet color may vary
  from photo</li></ul>
