description_list: '<h4>Not just a scaled-down adult pack, the Ace 48 pack from Osprey
  was designed to fit children''s dimensions and proportions-and it grows with them!
  Fits a variety of backs, thanks to its generous torso-length adjustment: just rip
  it, adjust it and stick it</h4><ul class="description"><li> Pack is sized to fit
  kids from approximately 12 to 16 years old</li><li> To ensure a healthy and comfortable
  carry, loaded pack should not be more than 15 to 20 percent of child''s body weight</li><li>
  AirScape backpanel features three sections of ridged foam and a central air chimney
  for increased ventilation</li><li> Running down the sidewall, peripheral rods anchor
  to load-lifter straps and hipbelt, actively transferring load and resisting sag</li><li>
  Top-loading design gives you easy access to the pack''s contents; two zippered pockets
  in removable/extendable lid let you stash maps and small items</li><li> Retractable
  sleeping bag compartment has straps to pull it in from the inside allowing the negative
  space on the outside for a sleeping bag or pad</li><li> ErgoPull hipbelt closure
  provides extra cinching leverage-drawing tension along top and bottom, not through
  the center-relieving hipbone pressure</li><li> Zippered pockets on hipbelt let you
