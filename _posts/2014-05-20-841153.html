  Bolt skis with bindings</li><li> K2 recommends using the K2 A</li><li>M</li><li>P</li><li>
  Bolt skis with bindings for 80% groomed and 20% ungroomed skiing</li><li> Designed
  with a new mix of technology, the K2 A</li><li>M</li><li>P</li><li> Bolt skis offer
  incredible stiffness and edge hold on firm snow and the ability to effortlessly
  initiate turns</li><li> Combination of a strong core, shock-absorbent secondary
  core and X-shaped carbon support creates skis with unshakable hold on hardpack and
  incredible side-to-side response</li><li> Metal laminate construction alternates
  layers of fiberglass and titanium above and below the fir core to provide vibration
  damping and powerful responsiveness</li><li> Typically a super-beefy ski like the
  Bolt would be unforgiving and tough to turn, but K2 has combined the aforementioned
  features with a very slight rise in the tips</li><li> Speed Rocker initiates turns
  easily and offers agile performance, and normal camber underfoot offers responsive
  power and tenacious edge hold on firm snow</li><li> Progressive sidecut has different
  curve shapes along different parts of the ski-more aggressive in the tip, less aggressive
  in the tail</li><li> Progressive sidecut results in confident, quick turn initiation
  on hard snow and easy release in crud and powder</li><li> Hybridtech sidewalls blend
  the performance characteristics of sidewalls with the forgiving flex of cap construction
  in the tip and tail</li><li> Hybridtech offers responsiveness and power underfoot
  and maintains smooth initiation and easy exits from turns</li><li> Marker K2/MX
  14</li><li>0 integrated binding system transfers power directly to the ski for unmatched
  precision and control during aggressive descents</li><li> Lightweight Marker Inter-Pivot
  heel acts over a wide surface area, transferring power directly to ski's edges for
  excellent carving performance</li><li> Embedded hubs in the core of the ski are
  50mm apart, decreasing the distance between the binding and ski edge to enhance
  performance</li></ul>
