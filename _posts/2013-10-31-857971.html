description_list: <h4>An all-terrain destroyer, the K2 Slayblade snowboard is built
  stiff for crud-busting days, but features a rockered tip for amazing float in pow
  and catch-free performance in the park</h4><ul class="description"><li> All-new
  Lifted Baseline(TM) offers effortless pop and stability; this board is flat between
  your feet and is lifted at the tip and tail for camberlike performance</li><li>
  Tweekend profile features a rockered tip for a great feel when sliding rails, landing
  jumps and carving powder</li><li> Evenly weighted contact points give you the straight
  tracking, effortless precision of a flat board</li><li> Hyper Progressive sidecut
  mellows out the transitions, leaving you with a predictable, all-around board; you
  can make ultrafine adjustments at any speed and in all conditions</li><li> Directional
  twin shape provides plenty of overall float and control, offering a balanced ride
  that's equally versatile ridden regular or switch</li><li> Hybritech construction
  minimizes the overall amount of materials used to unleash lightweight precision,
  powerful response and buttery-smooth performance</li><li> WH4 wood core, with generous
  Honeykomb material between the bindings and rails, provides a fine-tuned response;
  it's engineered to maintain durability with minimal weight</li><li> Bamboo is blended
  into the core for increased strength and added durability; carbon webs near binding
  area help you maximize control</li><li> A pre-loaded, camber-shaped Ollie Bar is
  placed in the center backbone section between the bindings to enhance ollie pop
  and pressing power</li><li> Fiberglass laminated in directional layers adds torsional
  stiffness, improving edge hold and increasing stability during off-axis landings</li><li>

  usage, it's the highest quality sintered base offered by K2</li><li> </li></ul>
