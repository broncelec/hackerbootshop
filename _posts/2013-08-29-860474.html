description_list: <h4>High-performance bindings for those who use AT boots at the
  resort, the Marker Lord S</h4><ul class="description"><li>P</li><li> bindings can
  accommodate both alpine and A</li><li>T</li><li> soles using a unique pin system</li><li>
  Pin system allows the toe to be set in either of two distinct positions, then the
  fine adjustment can be made via the AFD height adjustment screw</li><li> The stand
  height of the Lord is also much lower than most AT bindings, increasing power transfer
  to skis</li><li> DIN settings from 5 - 14 offer high performance for advanced skiers</li><li>
  Lightweight and strong magnesium parts and wide toe baseplates increase durability
  and control of wide-waisted skis</li><li> Triple Pivot Elite toes absorb high levels
  of energy to help prevent prerelease, and updated horizontal torsion bar reinforcements
  enhance power and lateral precision</li><li> Lightweight Inter-Pivot heels focus
  power in the direction of the boot soles and offer superior holding power and energy
  transfer</li><li> Stainless-steel antifriction devices allow essential lateral boot
  movement despite dirty or worn soles or negative sliding friction</li><li> 110mm
  brakes fit all-mountain wide skis and some powder skis; mounting configuration of
  the Marker Lord S</li><li>P</li><li> downhill ski bindings requires a 78mm minimum
  ski width</li></ul>
