<h3>The REI Aldervale Roll-Up pants travel and wear well, no matter what's on the day's agenda</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Weather warming up? Aldervale pants roll up to capri-length and secure with secure snap-tab closures</li>
<li> Woven 2-way stretch fabric is abrasion resistant, quick drying and easy to care for; it provides UPF 50+ sun protection, shielding skin from harmful ultraviolet rays</li>
<li> Drawcord at the waist adjusts the fit; easy on/off with a zip fly and snap closure</li>
<li> Front angle-entry hand pockets, back patch pockets with snap-flap closures and a right leg cargo pocket with snap flap</li>
<li> REI Aldervale Roll-Up pants feature a slim, lean fit; back darts shape the waist for a smooth fit</li>
</ul>
