<h3>Grab your skis and get ready to explore backcountry terrain with the waterproof, insulated Saiku gloves from The North Face</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> They offer great dexterity for holding ski poles and handling zippers</li>
<li> Hyvent waterproof, breathable technology utilizes a polyurethane coating for waterproof protection, moisture permeability and durability</li>
<li> PrimaLoft(R) One is a patented ultrafine microfiber blend that offers downlike softness, and is incredibly lightweight and water repellent</li>
<li> 100g insulation on the palms and 150g on the backs of the hands keeps your fingers warm when you're skiing down cold, snowy slopes</li>
<li> Palms are lined with polyester with a FlashDry(TM) fabric additive that dramatically improves drying time and breathability without adding weight or bulk or washing out</li>
<li> 5 Dimensional Fit(TM) uses 5 measurements of the hand to construct gloves with an accurate and consistent fit</li>
<li> Radiametric Articulation(TM) improves warmth and blood flow to your fingers by mirroring the natural relaxed curve of the hand</li>
<li> The North Face Saiku gloves have water-resistant cowhide leather exteriors that stand up to regular use and provide great grip</li>
<li> Low-profile cuffs fit underneath your jacket; stretchy cuffs seal out cold air</li>
</ul>
