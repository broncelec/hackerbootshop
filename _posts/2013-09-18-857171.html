description_list: <h4>Dependable and comfortable, Union Force snowboard bindings provide
  park-to-peak proficiency so you can easily transition from sliding rails to ripping
  big turns in deep snow</h4><ul class="description"><li> Stage IV bases are made
  wth high-quality DuPont(TM) Zytel(R) ST nylon; they're strong, supportive and secure,
  and balance comfort and response</li><li> Baseplates are designed to be supremely
  strong with the smallest footprint possible; this promotes free, even board flex
  for sweet response, board control and durability</li><li> Injected dual-density
  EVA bushings damp vibrations underfoot, promoting a comfortable ride and smooth,
  even board flex with no dead spots</li><li> Extruded aluminum heel cups undergo
  an anodizing process that further increases their strength by 30%; they'll maintain
  their shape no matter how much wear and tear they see</li><li> Multizone highbacks
  offer three different zones of flex for a transitional top-to-bottom flex, with
  the top third being the softest and the bottom third the stiffest</li><li> 3D Direct-Connect
  ankle straps eliminate elasticity and evenly distribute pressure across feet and
  ankles for increased comfort and board control</li><li> Multi-position toe straps
  fit a wide range of boots; magnesium buckles are 4 times stronger than aluminum
  with only half the weight</li><li> Union Force bindings are compatible with Burton
  The Channel M6 snowboards</li></ul>
