description_list: <h4>Rip down the resort or head out on a backcountry tour with the
  powerful Scarpa TX Pro telemark boots</h4><ul class="description"><li> They're compatible
  with NTN telemark bindings and Dynafit-style randonee bindings for versatility</li><li>
  100% Pebax(R) plastic construction provides high stiffness and power without a lot
  of weight; Pebax plastic maintains a consistent flex in all temperatures</li><li>
  NTN boots do away with the duckbill traditionally found on telemark boots, making
  walking and scrambling easy; boots are compatible with NTN telemark bindings, sold
  separately</li><li> Boots also feature tech fittings at the toes and heels to allow
  use with Dynafit-style bindings-that's right, you can ski free- or fixed-heel with
  the same boots! Custom-thermal-formable Intuition Speed Pro G liners use dual-density
  foam for great performance, comfort and support</li><li> Tongue-style liners (as
  opposed to a wrap-style liners) provide easy entry and comfortable flex through
  the shins when touring and making telemark turns</li><li> Pull tabs on the tongues
  and rear top edges of the liners ease entry</li><li> Liners can be custom molded
  to your feet by an REI ski shop professional for the optimal fit</li><li> 4 magnesium
  buckles are strong and light; asymmetric tongues transfer power precisely</li><li>
  Second buckle from the bottom on each boot is designed to secure your foot and heel
  in place; thicker cable than on previous versions improves durability</li><li> Wide
  rip-and-stick power straps wrap securely around the outside of the cuffs, distributing
  pressure and bringing the cuffs as close as possible your lower legs</li><li> Rear
  ski/walk mechanisms free the cuffs for walking comfort; flip the switches to ski
  mode and you can lock the cuffs at 14deg or 20deg of forward lean</li><li> Scarpa
  TX Pro telemark boots feature lugged Vibram soles for good grip while hiking on
  rock and snow</li></ul>
