description_list: <h4>Built with aerospace aluminum for a lightweight, ultra-strong
  design, the Black Diamond Transfer 3 shovel helps you throw as much snow as possible
  from the smallest footprint of space</h4><ul class="description"><li> The durable,
  high-volume blade and extendable shaft provide the snow-moving performance you need
  in any backcountry situation</li><li> Shaft deploys quickly via a quick squeeze
  of spring pins; shaft shape prevents rotation for positive engagement of spring
  pins every time</li><li> Ergonomic T-grip handle feels like a D-grip but packs small
  and is glove- and mitten-friendly</li><li> Sturdy anodized 6000-series aluminum
  blade has a smooth and flat shape that carves quickly through snow during recovery
  and cuts clean during pit analysis</li><li> Pointed blade enables more effective
  chopping and flat sides help in smoothing pit walls; anchor holes through blade
  allow use as a dead man anchor</li><li> Black Diamond Transfer 3 shovel weighs 650g
  (1 lb</li><li> 7 oz)</li></ul>
