  to enhance your performance, increase your safety and create an unparalleled connection
  with your skis</h4><ul class="description"><li> Why settle for less?</li><li> Remember
  last time you hit a small bump, your ski randomly popped off, and you went down

  which is a rotating heel piece</li><li> Turntable heel rotates with the boot directly
  under your tibia, creating consistent and reliable release</li><li> FKS also features
  25mm of vertical elastic travel which absorbs shock and allows a lower setting of
  release values</li><li> Rossignol has reduced the space between heelpiece and toepiece
  mounting points; the result is increased responsiveness and more consistent ski
  flexing</li><li> 3 contact points between the bindings and the heels ensure effective
  power transfer</li><li> Antifriction device increases leverage and control, especially
  on wide skis</li><li> Rossignol FKS 140 XXL bindings come with 115mm brakes that
  fit most all-mountain wide skis and some powder skis</li><li> DIN setting of 5 -
