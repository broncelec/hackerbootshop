description_list: <h4>The folks at Scarpa tell us the Maestrale is the world's lightest
  4-buckle randonee boot</h4><ul class="description"><li> We haven't weighed every
  boot ever made, but at only 3,032g (6 lbs</li><li> 10 oz) per pair, it's easy to
  believe</li><li> The Maestrale boots are perfect for backcountry tours that involve
  miles of hiking and skinning to reach fresh tracks off the summit of an alpine peak</li><li>
  Boots feature lightweight Pebax Rnew(R) plastic that is made from castor plant oil
  rather than petroleum as most plastics are</li><li> Pebax Rnew performs exceptionally
  well across a wide range of temperatures, ensuring consistent flex, strength and
  stability</li><li> Shell design combines the best of both the overlap and cabrio
  constructions to allow easy entry/exit, excellent volume control and strong support
  for downhill performance</li><li> Touring-style Intuition Pro Flex liners use 100%
  Ultralon(R) foam for a custom fit; liners offer good range of motion yet provide
  support with stiff tongues for the descent</li><li> Tongue-style liners (as opposed
  to a wrap-style liners) provide easy entry and comfortable flex through the shins
  when touring</li><li> See an REI ski shop professional to have the liners custom
  molded to your feet to maximize comfort and performance</li><li> Boots are compatible
  with all randonee bindings; tech fittings at the toes of the boots accept Dynafit-style
  bindings</li><li> Tech fittings have grooves that make getting into Dynafit-style
  bindings easy; fitting indicators can be seen from above to help you line the boot
  toes up with the bindings</li><li> 4 magnesium buckles are strong and light; asymmetric
  tongues transfer power precisely</li><li> Wide rip-and-stick power straps wrap securely
  around the outside of the cuffs, distributing pressure and bringing the cuffs as
  close as possible your lower legs</li><li> Rear ski/walk mechanisms free the cuffs
  for walking comfort; flip the switches to ski mode and you can lock the cuffs at
  18deg or 22deg of forward lean</li></ul>
