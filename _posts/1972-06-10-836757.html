<h3>Stay warm, dry and comfortable in The North Face Free Thinker women's shell pants, offering full coverage during deep powder days in big mountain chutes</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Sturdy Gore-Tex(R) Pro Shell uses 3-layer construction for superb durability, light weight and waterproof, breathable protection</li>
<li> Fully taped seams create the ultimate seal against wind and snow</li>
<li> Inner thigh vents and internal leg gaiters with stretch-mesh gussets control airflow and temperature; waterproof, bonded zipper vents</li>
<li> Warmth is regulated by allowing cool, dry air to flow in through mesh gussests; as heated, moist air rises and exits upper thigh vents</li>
<li> Rip-and-stick adjustment tabs at side of waist and zippered, snap-closure fly secure the fit</li>
<li> Hand pockets and thigh pockets, all with waterproof, bonded zippers, keep accessories organized</li>
<li> Pant-a-locks tabs secure pants to coordinating jackets from The North Face (jacket sold separately)</li>
<li> Reinforced edge guards resist abrasion from boots, boards and skis</li>
<li> Embedded RECCO(R) reflector enhances radio signals from search-and-rescue RECCO detectors for quicker acquisition of position in an avalanche</li>
</ul>
