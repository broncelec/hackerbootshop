description_list: <h4>The heirloom black patina on this 4 qt</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Lodge Logic Deep Dutch oven eliminates the time and effort of seasoning-it's ready
  to use right out of the box! Lodge coats the entire surface of the oven with a proprietary
  vegetable oil formula, then bakes the oil onto the utensil in a hot industrial oven</li><li>
  The high temperature allows the oil to penetrate deeply into the cast iron surface,
  creating that prized heirloom finish</li><li> Cast iron pot distributes heat evenly-perfect
  for both quick, high-heat browning and long, slow cooking</li><li> 10-in</li><li>
  diameter oven and lid have handles for convenience</li><li> Snug, flanged lid makes
  a self-basting cover that keeps in heat</li><li> The Lodge Logic Deep Dutch oven
  is ideal for stews or meats</li></ul>
