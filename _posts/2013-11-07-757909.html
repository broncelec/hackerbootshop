description_list: <h4>This ultra-lightweight packcover is lighter than a multi-tool
  and far more practical in a downpour! Siliconized Cordura(R) nylon cover keeps your
  pack and, therefore, your clothes, sleeping bag and gear protected from the elements</h4><ul

  fibers stretch under pressure instead of locking together and tearing</li><li> Seamless
  construction for weather-tight protection</li><li> Siliconized nylon mini stuff
  sack attaches to packcover so it won't get lost</li><li> Mid-back keeper strap helps
  secure cover to the pack and keep the sides from catching wind</li></ul>
