description_list: <h4>Perfect for exploring the mountain, the Tecnica Cochise 90 ski
  boots feature a specialized hiking mode</h4><ul class="description"><li> Ski/hike
  switch frees upper cuff to work with your stride and makes it easy to hike for your
  turns</li><li> A steel and aluminum, metal-pin-to-metal plate connection locks the
  upper cuff to the lower shell when you're ready to ski and allows you to really
  flex into your skis</li><li> Lightweight, mono-injected polymer shell is designed
  to make it easy going uphill, and it provides the responsive power you need on the
  way back down</li><li> Soft plastic over instep makes it easy to get your feet in
  the boots</li><li> Liners offer superior heel hold, complete foot envelopment and
  rubberized, shock-absorbent materials in feet</li><li> Custom-formable liners can
  be heated in a specialty ski shop to achieve a personalized fit</li><li> Neoprene
  toe boxes increase warmth in feet and absorb vibrations</li><li> Catches have a
  whopping 44mm range-22mm forward and 22mm back</li><li> Instep catch is hinged,
  allowing excellent pressure distribution; plus, it pivots away from the shell, letting
  the shell spread for easy entry</li><li> 40mm rip-and-stick power strap provides
  effective cuff closure and efficient energy transmission as the skier works the
  boot forward</li><li> Cuff alignment matches the angle of the cuff with the shape
  of the lower leg, increasing comfort and performance</li><li> Very sticky arches
  and soles are designed for hiking in snow</li><li> Shock-absorbent heels smooth
  descents and soften landings</li><li> With a flex index of 90, Tecnica Cochise 90
  ski boots provide the power transfer preferred by intermediate skiers</li></ul>
