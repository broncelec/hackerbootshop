description_list: <h4>The Aqua-Bound Sting Ray Posi-Lok carbon-shaft paddle is a lightweight,
  tough paddle suited to exploring your local waters with a minimum of effort</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> Simple, intuitive and strong, the Posi-Lok(R) ferrule uses
  a 2-button release to detach and adjust feather angle</li><li> To join, simply slide
  the Posi-Lok ferrule together and listen for the audible "click"</li><li> Posi-Lok
  resists corrosion and completely eliminates play between each piece of the paddle</li><li>
  Feathering is adjustable in the increments of 0 / 15 / 30 / 45 / 60deg right or
  left</li><li> Lightweight carbon shaft provides low swing weight and slight shaft
  flex, promoting a comfortable experience in the cockpit from launch until takeout</li><li>
  Fiberglass-reinforced nylon blades provide excellent durability when pushing off
  rocks or barnacles</li><li> Wide, asymmetrical dihedral blade face is optimized
  for low-angle paddling and produces a smooth stroke with minimal flutter</li><li>
  Rubber drip rings keep water away from hands and lap</li></ul>
