<h3>First time sleeping under the stars? Make a sound investment with the REI Arctic Pod synthetic sleeping bag that is feature-packed, built to last, and priced for your budget</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Synthetic hollow-fiber insulation retains heat while providing loft and some compressibility; construction eliminates cold spots</li>
<li> Equally distributed insulation all the way around the bag accommodates the multiposition sleeper</li>
<li> Relaxed fit from the shoulders to the hips increases comfort by providing ample space to move around</li>
<li> Ripstop nylon shell resists water and abrasion; smooth nylon taffeta lining is comfortable against your skin</li>
<li> Shell fabric is treated with a Durable Water Repellent finish to repel moisture and stains</li>
<li> Contoured hood, insulated full-face muffler, full draft collar and full-length draft tube with ground-level seams keep body heat in and cold air out</li>

<li> The REI Arctic Pod sleeping bag has an external chest pocket that stows your watch, glasses or other small essentials</li>
<li> Differentiated drawcords (1 round, 1 flat) let you adjust hood and neck easily in the dark</li>
<li> Full-length of zipper is backed by wide, antisnag binding tape</li>
<li> Any REI backpacking bag can be zipped to any other REI backpacking bag because of the consistent 63 in</li>
<li>, No</li>
<li> 5, YKK zipper; women's bags zip on the right, men's on the left</li>
<li> Pad loops provide attachment points to keep your sleeping bag and pad together to avoid rolling off onto the cold ground (straps and sleeping pad sold separately)</li>
<li> Includes stuff sack and storage bag</li>
<li> European Norm (EN) is an independent third-party temperature rating, allowing accurate comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags</li>
