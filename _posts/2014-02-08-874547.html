description_list: '<h4>The concept is simple: a plane on a tether</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  But the design and performance are anything but ordinary</li><li> The SkyTrix Kite
  from Daydream Toy can climb, dive, loop and boomerang, all without batteries</li><li>
  The people-powered SkyTrix Kite is a radically new design in flying toys-it can
  glide more than 200 ft</li><li>, no wind required</li><li> Great for a long-distance
  game of catch between multiple people or a game of boomerang on your own</li><li>
  As you learn the feel and possibilities of the tether, you can start doing tricks
  such as casting, snap backs, and loops</li><li> SkyTrix Kite from Daydream Toy does
  not use batteries or a gyroscope, and is designed for ages 8 and up</li></ul>'
