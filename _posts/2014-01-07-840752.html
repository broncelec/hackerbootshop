description_list: <h4>The Rottefella NTN Freedom telemark bindings bring the benefits
  of NTN to a lightweight binding setup that enables you to tour deep into the backcountry
  for fresh powder</h4><ul class="description"><li> At 1,500g per pair (3 lbs</li><li>
  5 oz), the Freedom bindings are comparable to other telemark bindings, yet they
  have the benefits of a step-in design and releasability</li><li> Step-in design
  makes the bindings easy to get in and out of-no more bending down to attach heel
  levers to your boots</li><li> Unlike traditional telemark bindings, NTN bindings
  are symmetrical so you don't need to worry about which ski is for the left foot
  and which is for the right</li><li> Sideways release helps prevent injuries during
  falls</li><li> Free-pivot mode provides resistance-free touring while skinning up
  hills; flip-up climbing wires reduce fatigue on your legs as you skin up steep hills</li><li>
  Bindings provide great torsional rigidity for immediate energy transfer from boot
  to ski edge</li><li> NTN bindings require NTN-compatible boots (sold separately);
  such boots do not have the traditional 75mm duckbill, making walking easier</li><li>
  Power Tube spring cartridges create consistent resistance as you drop into a turn;
  Large bindings come with medium-flexing blue Power Tubes installed</li><li> Small
  bindings come with soft-flexing green Power Tubes installed</li><li> You can install
  green (soft), blue (medium) and red (stiff) cartridges (not included) for a desired
  flex</li><li> Rottefella NTN Freedom telemark bindings include 110mm ski brakes
  that fit most powder skis</li><li> Large bindings fit Garmont NTN boot sizes 26
  mondo and up; fit Scarpa and Crispi NTN boot sizes 26</li><li>5 mondo and up</li><li>
  Small bindings fit Garmont NTN boot sizes 25</li><li>5 mondo and down; fit Scarpa
  and Crispi NTN boot sizes 26 mondo and down</li></ul>
