description_list: <h4>With built-in pop, the Ride Machete snowboard ensures you'll
  have nothing but fun in the park and pipe</h4><ul class="description"><li> Its rockered
  profile gives you a smooth, surfy, lively ride</li><li> LowRize(TM) rocker lifts
  the contact points out of the snow just enough to give you the ultimate hook-free,
  smooth ride without sacrificing pop</li><li> Twin shape places you in a centered
  stance for a balanced ride whether riding regular or switch</li><li> Pop Rods(R)
  2</li><li>0 wood core features carbon rods in the tip and tail, creating potent
  pop without adding stiffness; ideal for all freestyle maneuvers</li><li> Carbon
  Array 3(TM) stringers in the binding zone channel your power to the board for maximum
  control, regardless of your stance location</li><li> Lightweight and forgiving,
  the top and base are wrapped in a web of stitched biaxial glass, which increases
  torsional stiffness and snap</li><li> Durable, skate-inspired Slimewalls(R) sidewalls
  absorb impact and smooth the interaction between the board and riding surface; plus,
  as a bonus, they glow in the dark</li><li> Edges contain nearly 50% more steel than
  standard snowboard edges, resulting in unmatched resistance to edge cracking; edges
  can be "detuned" to enlarge board's turning radii</li><li> Ride Machete snowboard
  features a Fusion 4000 sintered base that is durable, hard and, best of all, fast</li><li>
