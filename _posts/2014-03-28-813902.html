description_list: <h4>The Serfas RX saddle keeps you sitting tall and spinning for
  hours in well-designed comfort</h4><ul class="description"><li> Serfas RX saddle
  is medically tested and proven to reduce cycling-related discomfort and numbness</li><li>
  A groove from tip to tail shifts rider's weight to inner thighs and buttocks, avoiding
  contact with the perineum, relieving pelvic discomfort</li><li> Also, the majority
  of rider weight is placed on the rear of the saddle, further reducing pressure against
  the perineal artery</li><li> Patented dual-density technology uses molded rubber
  inserts on base for shock absorption and an extra layer of Reactive Gel for added
  comfort</li><li> Hard frame provides excellent support and allows for increased
  ventilation</li><li> Men's saddle is slightly narrower than the women's, with a
  slightly longer nose</li></ul>
