description_list: <h4>The women's Ride Baretta snowboard, featuring a Hybrid All Mountain
  shape, has rocker in the nose and micro-camber that extends from the front foot
  to the tail for amazing all-mountain performance</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Directional twin shape is a great choice for all-mountain riding; Hybrid All Mountain
  shape offers tons of float, but also locks in edges when turning</li><li> Lightweight
  Aspen core incorporates bamboo to provide a perfect balance between strength and
  weight</li><li> Carbon Array 3(R) stringers in the binding zone channel your power
  to the board for maximum control, regardless of your stance location</li><li> Fiberglass
  on top and on the bottom of the core combine to provide a complete web of protection
  and flex</li><li> Durable, skate-inspired Slimewalls(R) sidewalls absorb impact
  and smooth the interaction between the board and riding surface</li><li> Edges contain
  nearly 50% more steel than standard snowboard edges, resulting in unmatched resistance
  to edge cracking; edges can be "detuned" to enlarge board's turning radii</li><li>
  Ride Baretta snowboard features an extruded base that is durable, hard and, best
  of all, fast</li><li> </li></ul>
