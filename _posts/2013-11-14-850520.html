description_list: <h4>Destined for placid scenery and great memories, the Folbot Kiawah
  133 folding kayak is designed for quick assembly and lazy afternoons on the water</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> Maybe you can't store a hard-shell at home, or maybe you
  want the best paddling experience possible on an upcoming destination trip; either
  way, you'll want a Folbot</li><li> It sets up in about 20 min</li><li>, and folds
  up into a pack that you can store in your car's trunk or your gear closet</li><li>
  Thanks to a clever tensioning device in the rear of the kayak, you can first assemble
  the frame and then insert it into the skin, streamlining the set-up process</li><li>
  The Kiawah 133 is the smaller cousin of the Cooper, suited to paddlers weighing
  130 - 180 lbs</li><li> Perfect for day trips, the stable hull tracks well and cuts
  through flatwater and gentle currents with ease</li><li> Used by roofers, the military
  and whitewater-raft makers, a synthetic rubber material called Elvaloy is tough
  like a rhino's hide and protects the hull of the Kiawah</li><li> Urethane-coated
  polyester protects the decks; all outer materials on the Kiawah resist UV light
  and are designed to take a beating without puncturing</li><li> Frame of the Kiawah
  is just as sturdy as its skin, with stainless-steel keel brackets (say that 3 times
  fast), aircraft-grade tubing and anodized aluminum cross pieces</li><li> Inflatable
  chambers called sponsons run the full length of the boat to increase tension and
  lock frame pieces into place; sponsons also flare out the hull to enhance stability</li><li>
  Seat and footpegs adjust to create a comfortable position in the cockpit</li><li>
  Easy-to-open zippers with high-strength zipper heads offer access to interior of
  kayak; rip-and-stick stormflaps and water-resistant closures keep things sealed
  up tight</li><li> Solid aluminum strip protects the bow and stern keels</li><li>
  What's included? Your kayak will come inside its backpack with skin, frame, 2 foot
  braces, 2 air sponsons, 2 safety bladders, and inflatable seat</li></ul>
