<h3>In our REI Airflyte hoodie, cold mornings and not-so-perfect training weather are no longer excuses to prevent you from enjoying a run</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Sleek and stretchy fabric wicks moisture during exercise to keep you dry and comfortable</li>
<li> Fabric offers a UPF rating of 50+</li>
<li> Close-fitting hood covers neck and stays put while running; short zipper makes it easy to put on hoodie or enhance ventilation</li>
<li> Ergonomic seam placement complements your natural movements, and flat seams reduce chafing</li>
<li> Thumbholes offer a bit of extra warmth on your wrists</li>
<li> Extended rear hem increases coverage and protects from splashes</li>
<li> The REI Airflyte hoodie offers an active fit that moves with you</li>
</ul>
