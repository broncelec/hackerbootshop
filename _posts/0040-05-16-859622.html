<h3>The moisture-wicking and quick-drying REI Multisport Crew socks use CoolMax(R) EcoMade(TM) fabric, made from recycled plastic bottles, to keep feet comfortable</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> CoolMax EcoMade fabric offers the same moisture-wicking, quick-drying performance as regular CoolMax, yet is made of recycled PET</li>
<li> Nylon adds durability, and spandex offers stretch and shape retention</li>
<li> Mesh-knit toe and instep panels promote airflow and move moisture away from skin, keeping feet dry and blister free</li>
<li> Fully cushioned bottoms and heels absorb shock and protect against wear</li>
<li> Lin Toe(R) ''no feel'' seams reduce irritation and chafing along toes</li>
<li> Seconds; item has minor cosmetic imperfections that do not affect product performance</li>
</ul>
