<h3>The North Face NSE infant booties keep little feet safe and warm in a cocoon of coziness, keeping your infant ready for fun even in cold weather</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Lightweight Heatseeker(TM) synthetic insulation keeps little toes warm; fleece uppers and lining add warmth and feel soft against skin</li>
<li> Higher cuff provides additional coverage; rip-and-stick closures on both sides of the shoes ease on-and-off transitions</li>
<li> Synthetic bottoms on the North Face NSE booties are soft and flexible, allowing room for fast-growing feet; nonskid applique on outsoles helps provide grip</li>
<li> Closeout</li>
</ul>
