description_list: '<h4>BlueWater II Plus(TM) rope is a classic and economical choice
  for rappelling, rescue and caving</h4><ul class="description"><li> Especially useful
  in applications where dynamic "bounce" is unwanted: jumaring, rappelling and hauling</li><li>
  Kernmantle design matches a static nylon core (kern) with an abrasion-resistant
  braided polyester sheath (mantle) for durability</li><li> Double twist cabled core
  and sheath strands help combat twisting while hanging on the rope</li><li> Sheath
  design permits easier tying and untying of knots than some other static lines</li><li>
  Buy it by the foot, as much or as little as you need</li></ul>'
