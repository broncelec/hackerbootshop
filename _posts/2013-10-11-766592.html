description_list: <h4>With its light, slimmed-down design and waterproof, air-permeable
  eVENT(R) laminate base, this Sea To Summit dry sack is pure genius! This valve-free
  dry sack uses a breathable base made of waterproof laminate fabric, which allows
  air to be pushed out yet prevents water from entering</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Waterproof, breathable eVent laminate fabric base has reinforced stitching on all
  stress points for durability</li><li> Polyurethane-coated nylon body has double-stitched,
  sealed seams and reinforced stitching at stress points; white fabric allows visibility
  of contents</li><li> Waterproof, nonwicking Hypalon(R) roll-top closure locks in
  place with buckle-no compression straps needed! Oval shape resists rolling when
  laid on its side</li></ul>
