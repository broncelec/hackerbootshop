description_list: <h4>High-caliber bindings for the most aggressive big-mountain or
  park-and-pipe skiers, the Marker Jester Pro downhill ski bindings are made to perform
  on steep slopes when hesitation is not an option</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Burly DIN settings from 8 - 18 let hard-charging skiers stomp huge landings and
  hit mach speeds</li><li> Lightweight and strong magnesium parts and wide toe baseplates
  increase durability and control of wide-waisted skis</li><li> Level height creates
  a neutral stance with a consistent balance point for doing tricks either forward
  or backward, and freeride brakes ensure clearance when skiing backward</li><li>
  Triple Pivot Elite toes absorb high levels of energy to help prevent prerelease,
  and updated horizontal torsion bar reinforcements enhance power and lateral precision</li><li>
  Lightweight Inter-Pivot heels focus power in the direction of the boot soles and
  offer superior holding power and energy transfer</li><li> Stainless-steel antifriction
  devices allow essential lateral boot movement despite dirty or worn soles or negative
  sliding friction</li><li> The Marker Jester Pro bindings feature fixed antifriction
  devices to increase boot retention and power transmission</li><li> 110mm brakes
  fit all-mountain wide skis and some powder skis; mounting configuration of the Marker
  Jester Pro downhill ski bindings requires a 78mm minimum ski width</li></ul>
