description_list: '<h4>A speedy blend of light weight and high performance, the Mavic
  Ksyrium Elite wheelset comes equipped with tires for a complete, convenient wheel
  system that''s ready to roll right out of the box</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  22mm deep front and 25mm deep rear rims are strengthened where the spokes exert
  the greatest stress; rear rim has an asymmetric shape to enhance stiffness and durability</li><li>
  Lightweight yet strong, proprietary aluminum rims use a drilling method that doesn''t
  penetrate the tube-facing wall, strengthening the rim and eliminating need for rim
  strips</li><li> Both rims feature a milled braking surface to improve friction;
  rim joints are welded and milled to eliminate shuddering during braking and provide
  superior wheel balance</li><li> Inter Spoke Milling reduces material between spokes,
  lowering weight and the amount of effort needed to spin the wheels up for superb
  climbing and acceleration</li><li> Rear hub features a lightweight and stiff aluminum
  hub body with pawls that are backed by stainless-steel inserts for reliable, strong
  engagement and power transfer</li><li> Hubs boast a microadjustable system that
  lets you dial in bearing performance; double-sealed cartridge bearings deliver excellent
  longevity and smooth spinning</li><li> 18/20 double-butted straight-pull, bladed
  steel spokes are laced radially on the front wheel; rear has radial lacing on the
  drive-side, 2-cross on the non-drive-side</li><li> Yksion Pro 700x23c clincher tires
  are included, offering front- and rear-specific performance for maximizing grip
  up front and minimizing rolling resistance in the back</li><li> Tires have supple
  127 tpi casings and are backed with a strong, puncture-resistant nylon breaker;
  maximum recommended pressure of 130 psi (9 bars)</li><li> Please note: tubes use
  Presta valves</li><li> Mavic Kysrium Elite wheelset with tires comes with quick-release
  skewers and a multifunction adjustment wrench; 100mm front and 130mm rear axle spacing</li></ul>'
