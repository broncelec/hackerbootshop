<h3>The waterproof REI Guide gloves combine warmth and good dexterity to keep your hands comfortable when grasping ski poles, ice axes and other mountain gear on your winter adventures</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Nylon shells have waterproof, breathable inserts that keep your hands dry while you're skiing, snowboarding and hiking</li>
<li> Synthetic insulation helps keep your hands warm on chilly winter days; high-loft polyester sherpa fleece lines the backs of the gloves for great warmth</li>
<li> Wool blend lining in the palm wicks moisture to keep your hands dry</li>
<li> Durable goatskin leather palms with polyurethane patches give you a secure grip on ski poles, ice axes and other mountain equipment</li>
<li> Low-profile neoprene cuffs with rip-and-stick closures seal tightly around wrists to keep warmth in</li>
<li> Wipe your nose with the soft patches on the thumbs</li>
<li> Clip a carabiner (sold separately) through the loops on the middle fingers to hang the REI Guide gloves from your climbing harness</li>
</ul>
