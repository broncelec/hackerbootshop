description_list: <h4>A great alternative to kayak saddles! The J-cradle design of
  the Yakima HullRaiser mount works with any kayak, supporting it on its side, which
  is generally stiffer than the bottom</h4><ul class="description"><li> Accommodates
  most hull shapes; cradles and protects your kayak with soft pads</li><li> Because
  kayak is propped up on its side, it leaves more space on your crossbars for another
  kayak or other gear</li><li> Includes heavy-duty straps with padded buckles for
  secure transport</li><li> Fits round and square bars; fits most factory racks-just
  add Yakima MightyMounts (sold separately)</li><li> Includes straps with padded buckles
  and bow/stern tie-down straps</li></ul>
