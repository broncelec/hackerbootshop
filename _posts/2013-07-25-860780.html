description_list: <h4>Fast and smooth at speed, the advanced-level Atomic Smoke Ti
  ARC skis with bindings blaze down groomed runs with unwavering stability thanks
  to 76mm waists and a metal laminate in the core</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Titanium laminate enhances stability and boosts performance at high speeds</li><li>
  76mm waists offer superior maneuverability on groomed runs</li><li> When skis are
  unweighted, there is a slight rise in the tips that makes it easy to initiate turns</li><li>
  When skis are put on edge after starting a turn, the camber flattens out to deliver
  full-length contact with snow and excellent edge hold</li><li> Microcellular composite
  core is lighter and more lively than wood, and it reduces swing weight for effortless
  handling</li><li> Half-cap construction in tips and tails improves durability, and
  sidewalls in binding area enhance edge grip by absorbing shock</li><li> Sidewall
  construction ensures maximum torsional rigidity, uncanny edge grip and controlled
  tip-to-tail flex; sidewall is reinforced in binding area with 2 layers of material</li><li>
  Integrated bindings allow the skis to flex naturally for excellent edge contact
  and bump absorption</li><li> Bindings feature DIN 4 - 12 release settings, a range
  suited to advanced skiers at medium to high speeds</li><li> Base or topsheet color
  on the Atomic Smoke Ti ARC skis with bindings may vary from online photo</li></ul>
