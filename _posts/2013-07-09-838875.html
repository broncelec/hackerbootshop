description_list: <h4>Warm and comfortable, the women's Lange Exclusive RX 80 LV ski
  boots feature an expert fit for narrow feet</h4><ul class="description"><li> Shells
  made from a single, uniform material ensure the power transfer of the Lange Exclusive
  RX 80 LVs is highly efficient, even in varying temperatures</li><li> Shells are
  designed to create a centered, balanced stance using a low heel lift and an upright
  forward lean</li><li> Upright stance makes it easy to stay balanced on today's shaped
  and rockered skis, reducing fatigue and increasing efficiency of skiing technique</li><li>
  Women-specific fit accommodates narrow heels and low calf muscles with anatomically
  shaped liners and upper cuffs</li><li> Liners comfortably conform to your feet and
  precisely match the internal shape of the shell to create instant responsiveness</li><li>
  Liners may be custom molded using a heat treatment</li><li> Very light synthetic
  insulation increases warmth throughout the liner</li><li> Boots hold to ankles and
  heels thanks to specialized, anatomic padding and resist packing out</li><li> Reinforced
  wedges in tongues remove gaps between liners and shells and enhance wrap on upper
  leg</li><li> Specially designed instep provides excellent midfoot fit, resulting
  in heightened responsiveness, increased circulation and greater warmth</li><li>
  1-piece toe boxes and tongues eliminate seams and overlaps in the tongue attachment
  area, reducing pressure points at the instep and top of the toes</li><li> Low-profile
  buckles sit low on the shell and creates a strong, precise closure</li><li> Adjust
  cuff tightness with a simple rotation of the buckle catches; catches adjust 20mm,
  corresponding to the 3 positions of a conventional catch</li><li> 40mm power straps
  provide uniform and progressive cuff flex</li><li> Rubber soles offer traction for
  walking on slippery surfaces</li><li> With a flex index of 80, Lange Exclusive RX
  80 LV ski boots provide a flex that's welcoming for intermediate skiers</li></ul>
