description_list: <h4>Hard-charging, big-mountain skiers will dominate the slopes
  with the fun and lively Salomon Lord skis</h4><ul class="description"><li> The Salomon
  Lord skis work well if you're sticking to the groomed runs, but they are ideal if
  you find yourself switching between groomed runs and off-piste terrain</li><li>
  Full-wood core delivers direct transmission of power with precision and efficiency;
  designed for demanding skiers who require high performance</li><li> Monocoque construction
  uses a single-layer cap design to promote responsiveness and maneuverability</li><li>
  Additional layer underneath surface provides precise edge grip and efficient energy
  transfer from skier to snow for pulling off freeski maneuvers</li><li> Elastomer
  inserts placed over the edges absorb vibrations, resulting in a smooth ride that
  softens ski-to-snow contact</li><li> All-terrain rockered tips excel in soft snow
  and deliver fluid performance on hardpack; when put on edge, 95% of skis contact
  snow to offer precision on groomed runs</li><li> Directional twin-tip sidecut favors
  skiing forward, and slightly raised tails let you ride backward and stick the occasional
  switch landing</li><li> Strong polyethylene fiber threaded between the edges of
  the skis increases edge strength to withstand big impacts</li><li> Base or topsheet
  color may vary from online photo</li><li> Fiber reinforcement laid directly on the
  edges adds torsional rigidity and improves edge durability, and wide metal edges
  withstand big impacts and improve shock resistance</li></ul>
