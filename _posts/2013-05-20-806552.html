description_list: <h4>The Fritschi Diamir Freeride Pro randonee bindings are the perfect
  match for those wide skis you plan to take out on the next big powder day</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> Bindings are designed to transfer power directly to wide
  skis for downhill performance that rivals high-end alpine bindings; wide front and
  rear plates resist torsional flex</li><li> Features moving baseplates that allow
  you to raise your feet until they are perpendicular to the skis for complete freedom
  of movement</li><li> Quickly transition between touring mode and ski mode by adjusting
  the rear levers with a ski pole; levers also serve as heel lifts to make climbing
  hills more comfortable</li><li> Use a ski pole to move the levers into 4 different
  positions that give you 0deg, 3deg, 9deg or 13deg of lift while climbing</li><li>
  Independent toe and heel release provide reliable exits from the bindings when falling;
  fits DIN-standard alpine or lug-soled randonee boots</li><li> Antifriction plates
  with Teflon strips allow boots with lugged rubber soles to release evenly</li><li>
  DIN setting adjusts from 4 - 12</li><li> Fritschi Diamir Freeride Pro randonee bindings
  come with 120mm-wide ski brakes installed to accommodate today's powder skis</li><li>

  the binding at the start of your tour and then activated or deactived at any time</li><li>
