description_list: <h4>Built for tough mountaineering challenges and long backcountry
  tours, the powerful Fritschi Diamir Vipec 12 Randonee Bindings with Brakes balance
  ski performance, ease of use and reliable release</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Similar to the release system found in downhill bindings, the lateral release in
  the toe units occurs in 2 phases to release when you need it to but not when you
  don't</li><li> Heel units are on gliding plates that ensure the bindings have consistent
  contact pressure on the boots, even when the skis are significantly bent</li><li>
  Getting in the bindings is quick and easy-simply move the tips of your boots forward
  over the step-in bracket in the toe units and press down to click in</li><li> Unlike
  other tech-style bindings, the toe pieces on the Vipec bindings will release even
  when you're in uphill touring mode, but only when you need them to</li><li> Quickly
  switch back-and-forth between ski and tour mode by flipping the rear levers up or
  down with a pole; there's no need to release from the bindings to switch modes</li><li>
  Nonrotating heel pieces create a very stable platform for excellent control and
  power transfer to the skis</li><li> Heel pieces include flip-up climbing bars that
  can be changed easily with a ski pole; raise your heels to 9deg or 13deg depending
  on the steepness of the hill</li><li> Bindings include ski brakes to prevent runaway
  skis; choose from 120mm- or 108mm-wide brakes depending on your ski width</li><li>
  Choose the size that's just wider than the underfoot width of your skis; for example,
  choose 108mm size for 105mm-waisted skis</li><li> Fritschi Diamir Vipec 12 Randonee
  Bindings with Brakes have adjustable DIN release settings from 5 - 12</li><li> Compatible
  with boots featuring tech system toe and heel attachments, such as those found on
  all Dynafit boots and select styles of Garmont and Scarpa boots</li><li> Compatible
  with the Fritschi Diamir Traxion Crampons, not included</li></ul>
