description_list: <h4>Built for long spring, summer and fall backpacking trips where
  space and weight are at a premium, the Marmot Helium Sleeping Bag has toasty 850-fill
  goose down that's treated to fend off moisture</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  With a European Norm (EN) lower-limit rating of 16degF, the Helium sleeping bag
  is suitable for 3-season use and occasional winter outings</li><li> Lofty, premium
  850-fill-power goose down offers superb warmth for minimal weight; it's meticulously
  cleaned and processed for hypoallergenic qualities</li><li> Down is treated to resist
  moisture to retain warmth; treated down stays drier 10 times longer, maintains 150%
  more loft and dries 30% faster than untreated down</li><li> Nautilus 3D 6-baffle
  hood envelops your head in warmth; down gasket face muff allows hood to be cinched
  snug without digging into your face</li><li> Down-insulated draft collar and down-filled
  draft tube backing the snag-free zipper seal out cold air</li><li> Ground-level
  side seams eliminate cold air leaks and allow the goose down insulation to loft
  fully</li><li> Trapezoidal footbox is wider in the toe area and narrower in the
  heels to match the shape of your feet</li><li> Stretch tricot baffles allow the
  bag to be stuffed and unstuffed without tearing the baffle material</li><li> Lightweight
  Pertex(R) Microlight fabric stands up to abrasion and won't let the down escape</li><li>
  Zipper guards prevent zipper snags; locking zippers keep bag from opening if you
  toss and turn at night</li><li> Marmot Helium Sleeping Bag comes with a stuff sack
  and a storage bag</li><li> European Norm (EN) is an independent third-party temperature
  rating, allowing accurate comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags</li></ul>
