description_list: <h4>The brainy Boreas Bolinas 31 pack is truly one of a kind</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> It converts effortlessly from a ventilated, bike-friendly
  roll-top to a stable, back-hugging workhorse for day hikes and scrambles</li><li>
  With a simple push at the top and the pull of a strap, the innovative variable suspension
  transforms from close-fitting stability to off-the-back, trampoline-like ventilation</li><li>
  Adjusting the gap between the pack and your back is like adjusting a thermostat-bigger
  gap, more cooling airflow; smaller gap, more warmth and stability</li><li> Supportive,
  ventilated shoulder straps and back panel distribute pressure evenly with resilient
  foam that maintains its volume, even under a heavy load</li><li> Aluminum and steel
  hoop frame effectively transfers load weight to your hips; lightweight webbing hipbelt
  is removable</li><li> Water-resistant, roll-top main compartment features a completely
  waterproof pocket for wallets, phones and other items that run screaming from water</li><li>
  Organize often-used items with dual zippered side pockets and a tuck-away daisy
  chain; hydration sleeve and port enable on-the-go hydration (reservoir sold separately)</li><li>
  Lightweight, 210-denier ripstop pack fabric is impregnated with silicone for water-resistant
  durability that thwarts the tendency to wear out or rub off over time</li><li> The
  Boreas Bolinas 31 pack incorporates stretch panels that allow the pack body to expand
  and curve, depending on the load and suspension setting</li></ul>
