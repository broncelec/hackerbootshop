description_list: <h4>The Petzl Pixa 1 Pro headlamp keeps your hands free for tasks
  at home and around the campsite</h4><ul class="description"><li> Its wide, uniform
  beam is designed for close-range work</li><li> Single lighting mode outputs a uniform
  beam that lights up objects up to 15m away for 12 hrs</li><li>; LED outputs 25 lumens,
  which is plenty of light for close-range tasks</li><li> Regulated output keeps the
  brightness and distance consistent throughout the life of the batteries</li><li>
  When the batteries are almost dead, the headlamp will continue to shine a 5m beam
  for 10 hrs</li><li> so you can still work until you have a chance to change the
  batteries</li><li> Reliable, strong and durable light is constructed to withstand
  2m (6</li><li>6 ft</li><li>) falls and crushing by weights of up to 80kg (176 lbs</li><li>)</li><li>
  Can be worn as a standard headlamp or mounted on a helmet with the included plate;
  compatible with Petzl Vertex (2010 version) and Alveo helmets (not included)</li><li>
  Take the back mounting plate off and the light can be placed on any flat surface
  and aimed up to light up tight spaces</li><li> Large on/off selector dial is easy
  to manipulate with gloves on</li><li> Light body rotates up to 45deg so you can
  aim the beam right where you need it</li><li> Always working in dirty, wet places?
  Not to worry! Pixa 1 Pro's IP67 rating indicates complete protection against dust
  and protection against submersion to 1m for 30 min</li><li> Operates on 2 AA batteries
  (included); battery case is easy to open and close for quick battery changes; compatible
  with alkaline, NiMH, NiCd and lithium batteries</li><li> When storing the light,
  pivot the body so the LED faces the backing plate to protect the glass from scratches;

  headband easily detaches from the Petzl Pixa 1 Pro headlamp when you want to clean
  the light</li></ul>
