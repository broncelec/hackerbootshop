description_list: <h4>A celebrated favorite for advanced freestyle tricks in fresh
  powder, the Line Sir Francis Bacon skis float in pow with rockered tips and tails
  and are stiff enough for big moves in the half pipe</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Designed by skier, artist and filmmaker Eric Pollard, the Line Sir Francis Bacon
  skis are his personal choice for versatility and fun</li><li> Tip and tail rocker
  floats high in backcountry powder whether skiing forward or switch; relatively low
  rise planes through powder instead of plowing up and over</li><li> Core consists
  of light and strong maple wood stringers surrounded by aspen wood to provide snappy
  power for tricks and high stability at speed</li><li> Symmetrical flex pattern in
  tips and tails creates identical responsiveness whether skiing forward or switch</li><li>
  Widest points of the tips and tails are close to the center of the skis, reducing
  tail drag and hooking in powder</li><li> Thin cores and sidewalls in the tips reduce
  weight and make the skis easier to control</li><li> P-tex plastic sidewalls isolate
  vibrations, offering a smooth feel when charging at high speed</li><li> Extra-thick
  bases and edges add significant durability and impact resistance, and let you tune
  your skis many times throughout the season</li><li> The Line Sir Francis Bacon skis
  have 108mm waists that require bindings with wide brakes</li><li> Base or topsheet
  color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
