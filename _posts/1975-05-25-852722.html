<h3>The North Face Helmet balaclava is made from lightweight polyester fleece and is designed to be worn under a ski or climbing helmet for excellent protection from the cold while you're on the mountain</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Design allows the front to be worn over the nose or pulled down under the chin</li>
<li> Stretchy front panels keep the balaclava snug on your face</li>
<li> Polyester/elastane fabric wicks moisture off of your skin and dries quickly</li>
</ul>
