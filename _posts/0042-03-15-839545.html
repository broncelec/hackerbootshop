<h3>The REI Guide gloves combine warmth and good dexterity to keep your hands comfortable grasping ski poles, ice axes and other mountain gear</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Nylon shells have waterproof, breathable inserts that keep your hands dry while you're skiing, snowboarding and hiking</li>
<li> Leather palms and durable goatskin patches give you a secure grip of ski poles, ice axes and other mountain equipment</li>
<li> Synthetic insulation helps keep your hands warm on chilly winter days</li>
<li> Low-profile neoprene cuffs with rip-and-stick closures seal tightly around wrists to keep warmth in</li>
<li> Wipe your cold nose with the soft patches on the thumbs</li>
<li> Clip a carabiner (sold separately) through the loops on the pinky fingers to hang the REI Guide gloves from your climbing harness</li>
</ul>
