description_list: '<h4>Fit for racing, cyclocross and commutes, the Easton EA90 SLX
  Front Road Wheel is a top-of-the-line aluminum wheel with all the fixin''s: a smooth
  Echo hub, a wide rim width and tubeless compatability</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Every aspect of the Echo hub is designed to improve bearing life, increase stiffness
  and cut weight, and the extra width of the hub vastly increases durability</li><li>
  Featuring a 17</li><li>5mm internal rim width, the extra-wide alloy rim creates
  more surface area for traction when leaning into corners</li><li> UST tubeless compatibility
  offers the benefits of tubeless (lighter weight, lower tire pressure and fewer flats),
  with the option of using a traditional tube/tire setup</li><li> 16 double-butted,
  straight-pull spokes create a low-weight, high-performance wheel; specialized dual-threaded
  spoke nipples require no special tools for service</li><li> The Easton EA90 SLX
  Front Road Wheel is completely hand-built; spoke tension is acoustically tuned to
  provide the best possible ride right out of the box</li></ul>'
