<h3>Why mess with separate base layers? The REI Midweight Polartec(R) Power Dry(R) Allstar Suit delivers one-piece warmth to defy the chill and keep you skiing or snowboarding to the last chair</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Polartec Power Dry utilizes two different yarns on either side of the fabric to enhance comfort: interior yarn wicks moisture, and exterior yarn dries quickly</li>
<li> Combination of the two yarns helps keep you dry during highly aerobic activities because it moves moisture away from skin faster than single-component fabrics such as cotton</li>
<li> Waistband zipper with a functional fly is easy to undo when nature calls</li>
<li> Flatseam construction is soft and non-chafing next to skin</li>
<li> Fabric offers a UPF rating of 20 to protect against harmful UV light</li>
<li> The men's REI Midweight Polartec Power Dry Allstar Suits feature a next-to-skin fit that hugs the body</li>
</ul>
