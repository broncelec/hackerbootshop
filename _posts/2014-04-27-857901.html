  Coiler lacing system, with ankle and cable guides along entire edge of eyestays,
  distributes closure force evenly for a dialed-in fit that won't loosen up</li><li>

  moldable, internal J-bars enhance heel hold</li><li> Quick, single-pull liner lacing
  requires only one hand to use and stays locked until you release it with the comfortable
  webbing loop pulls</li><li> Low-profile, low-bulk cushioned soles absorb impact,
  enhance board feel and provide tractorlike grip</li></ul>
