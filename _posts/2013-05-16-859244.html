description_list: <h4>The Salomon Q-103 Stella women's skis blend the stability of
  103mm waists with the flotation of rockered tips and tails to create a pair of skis
  to surf powder and explore off-piste terrain</h4><ul class="description"><li> Rockered
  profile excels in soft snow and delivers fluid performance on hardpack; when put
  on edge, 95% of edge length contacts the snow for precision on groomed runs</li><li>
  Designed for demanding skiers who require high performance, full wood core delivers
  direct transmission of power with precision and efficiency</li><li> Perfect for
  pulling off freeski maneuvers, a single-layer cap design provides precise edge grip
  and efficient energy transfer from skier to snow</li><li> Elastomer inserts placed
  over the edges absorb vibrations, resulting in a smooth ride that softens ski-to-snow
  contact</li><li> Tips feature a honeycomb structure that reduces weight to make
  the skis more maneuverable and playful</li><li> Fiber reinforcements laid directly
  on the edges add torsional rigidity and improve edge durability, and wide metal
  edges withstand big impacts and improve shock resistance</li><li> The Salomon Q-103
  Stella women's skis require bindings with wide brakes</li><li> Base or topsheet
  color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
