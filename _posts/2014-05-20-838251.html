description_list: <h4>This Atlas 925 snowshoes starter kit combines a set of Atlas
  925 snowshoes, a pair of poles and a tote bag for great value and convenience</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> Durable frames are crafted from 6061 aluminum to create
  a stiff yet lightweight chassis</li><li> Nose and tail shapes are optimized to provide
  a balanced platform for stable footing and facilitate an easy, natural stride</li><li>
  Free-Rotating(TM) Suspension lets the binding rotate much farther forward than previous
  Atlas designs, freeing up the stride and reducing the amount of tail flip</li><li>
  The result of the design is that freedom of movement is increased, the toe crampon
  can bite into snow better and the foot is allowed a more natural rotation</li><li>
  Wrapp(TM) Trail bindings use a continuous webbing design that tightens snugly with
  a single pull; bindings also cradle feet and arches for a secure, comfortable fit</li><li>
  Abrasion-resistant, lightweight Nytex(TM) nylon decks stay flexible when cold and
  stand up to the elements for lasting use</li><li> Steel toe crampons supply sure-footed
  traction on icy and snowy terrain; heel crampons increase traction while traversing
  and descending</li><li> 2-part, adjustable-length poles assist with balance and
  propulsion; features lightweight 6000-series aluminum shafts, plastic grips and
  steel flex-tips</li><li> Poles also have wide, alpine powder baskets for pushing/planting
  stability and adjustable hand straps that minimize fatigue and enhance support</li><li>
  Poles adjust up to 130cm in length</li><li> Includes heavyweight nylon tote/storage
  bag with mesh panels that allow snowshoes to dry out after use</li><li> Atlas 925
  snowshoes' recommended load specification includes weight of hiker with gear</li></ul>
