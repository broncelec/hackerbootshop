<h3>The toasty and waterproof REI Snow Ridge gloves protect kids' hands from chilly wind and wetness</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Flexible ripstop polyester shells allow full range of motion; reinforced tactile grip on palms and thumbs provides extra abrasion- and water-resistance</li>
<li> Aquabloc(R) inserts are waterproof and windproof, yet breathe well to keep small hands warm and dry; polyester insulation adds warmth without a lot of bulkiness</li>
<li> REI Snow Ridge gloves have fuzzy polyester linings to wick moisture away from hands so they don't get clammy during high-energy fun in the snow</li>
<li> Soft fabric on the thumb offers a gentle place to wipe a cold nose</li>
<li> Precurved construction minimizes stress on seams and reduces compression of insulation, maximizing warmth</li>
<li> Stretchy fleece cuffs seal out snow and cold while trapping heat inside; adjustable wrist straps secure the fit</li>
</ul>
