  mutually exclusive</h4><ul class="description"><li> Hybrid double/single wall design

  and use trekking poles (sold separately) instead to reduce minimum weight to less
  than 3 lbs</li><li> Two large doors offer both occupants individual access; they
  create an open, airy feel and allow effective cross-ventilation to control condensation</li><li>

  from the sun; they let you leave the doors or windows open, even when it's raining</li><li>

  closed or left open for additional venting</li><li> With only 6 stakeout points,
