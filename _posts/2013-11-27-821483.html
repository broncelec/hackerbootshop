description_list: '<h4>Ready to use right out of the box, this 1 qt</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Lodge Logic Camp Dutch oven comes with a beautiful heirloom finish that eliminates
  the time and effort typically required to season cast iron cookware</li><li> From
  BACKPACKER 2012 Editors'' Choice Awards: "For car-, horse-, and boat-camping trips,
  when weight is no object, nothing beats these ovens for fireside meals</li><li>"</li><li>
  Lodge coats the entire surface of the oven with a proprietary vegetable oil formula,
  then bakes the oil onto the cookware with high-temperature gas ovens</li><li> The
  high temperature allows the oil to penetrate deeply into the cast iron surface,
  creating that prized heirloom finish</li><li> Cast iron distributes heat evenly-perfect
  for both quick, high-heat browning and long, slow cooking</li><li> Snug-fitting
  lid is flanged to hold hot coals on top for baking, stewing and roasting; flip the
  lid over for use as a griddle</li><li> High-gauge wire bail handle can be used to
  hang the Dutch oven over the hearth or campfire</li><li> 3 legs let you place the
  Lodge Logic Dutch oven over hot coals</li></ul>'
