description_list: '<h4>This Park crank puller is designed to remove crank arms from
  Shimano(R) Octalink spindles and ISIS Drive(R) splined systems</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  It uses a long, comfortable handle and a fine thread for the leverage needed to
  remove tight crankarms</li><li> Rotating tip ensures smooth operation and long life</li><li>
  Note: Will not work on crank arms that fit square, tapered bottom bracket spindles</li><li>
  Crankarms with a "one-key release" system do not use any crank puller tool--the
  one-key system acts as the remover</li></ul>'
