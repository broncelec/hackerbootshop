<h3>The North Face Arctic down parka combines weather resistance and the warmth of down with the full-length coverage of a trench coat</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Nylon shell fabric is soft to the touch and resists abrasion; seams are sealed for complete weather protection</li>
<li> Hyvent(TM) multilayer polyurethane coating provides waterproof protection, breathability and durability</li>
<li> Insulated with 550-fill-power goose down for a high warmth-to-weight ratio</li>
<li> Recycled polyester taffeta lining slides on easily over layers and wicks away moisture to keep you dry</li>
<li> Insulated hood sports a sassy (and detachable) faux-fur trim; hood drawcord secures the fit</li>
<li> Two-way center front zipper; attached internal fleece cuffs seal in warmth</li>
<li> The North Face Arctic parka has 2 zippered handwarmer pockets, 2 top-entry chest pockets and an internal media pocket</li>
</ul>
