<h3>Great protection for cross-country skiing, The North Face Isotherm half-zip men's top regulates your temperature with wind-resistant fabric and a warm merino wool fabric blend</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Wind-resistant front is flanked by stretchy, warm wool panels with FlashDry(TM) fibers around the sides, down the back and under the arms for great moisture management</li>
<li> Wind-resistant fabric protects your core and shoulders from the wind and cold without sacrificing breathability and mobility</li>
<li> Blend of merino wool, polyolefin and polyester fabric wicks moisture and dries quickly and offers light insulation in the cold</li>
<li> When your hands need light protection in chilly weather, pull the mitts out from the internal cuffs and over your fingers</li>
<li> The half-zip neck provides extra coverage when fully zipped, or quick ventilation when unzipped</li>
<li> 2-way zip; secure chest pocket; shaped hem; thumbholes; reflective hits</li>
<li> Athlete tested and competition proven, The North Face Isotherm half-zip jacket for men is part of the Flight Series(R) collection</li>
</ul>
