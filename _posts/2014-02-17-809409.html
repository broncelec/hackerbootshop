description_list: <h4>Well suited for sport and trad climbing, the Mammut Supersafe
  EVO 10</h4><ul class="description"><li>2mm x 60m climbing rope is treated to minimize
  friction and repel water and dirt so it can withstand regular use in the outdoors</li><li>
  COATINGfinish(TM) process uses a Teflon(R) coating to reduce friction and allow
  fibers to glide against each other for optimal load distribution and durability</li><li>
  superDRY(TM) sheath and core treatment protects against water and dirt, thereby
  increasing the durability of the rope; also maintains smooth handling characteristics</li><li>
  Kernmantle design combines a durable braided sheath with a shock-absorbent core
  for protection from fall forces</li><li> 10</li><li>2mm diameter holds up to regular
  use at the crag while keeping the rope light enough so you can haul it into a climb</li><li>
  7</li><li>9kN impact force reduces impact on climber, gear and anchor compared to
  ropes of higher kN ratings</li><li> 60m length allows long leads and rappels</li><li>
  Middle of the rope is marked with a black bar to facilitate rappels</li><li> Rope
  comes lap coiled, eliminating the time-consuming task of uncoiling a new rope to
  keep it from becoming twisted</li><li> Mammut Supersafe EVO climbing rope meets
  UIAA tests for falls, impact force and elongation</li></ul>
