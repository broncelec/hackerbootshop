  the Black Diamond Current skis are stiff and narrow enough to excel at tight, precise
  skiing while remaining fun in soft conditions</h4><ul class="description"><li> 86mm
  waist and rockered profile let you make the most of the latest storm, while its
  camber underfoot and short running length shine on wind-scoured summits and steep
  couloirs</li><li> Semi-rockered tips and tails rise up in deep snow to make trail
  breaking and turning easier</li><li> 3D Sandwich construction and tapered ABS sidewalls

  hold when it counts</li><li> Dual Torsion Bow construction features two ribs that
  run the length of each ski to distribute loads and direct power to the edges</li><li>

  (skins not included)</li><li> High-speed sintered bases on the Black Diamond Current
  skis feature a cross-hatch stone grind for the best balance of durability, glide
  and maintenance</li><li> Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li><li>
