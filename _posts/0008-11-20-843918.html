<h3>Perfect as a layering top, the women's REI Lightweight crew shirt is an easy choice for stop-and-go activities in cool weather</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Polyester and spandex fabric wicks moisture and dries quickly</li>
<li> Fabric protects skin against harmful ultraviolet light with a UPF rating of 50+ and is very soft to the touch</li>
<li> Flatseam construction is soft and non-chafing next to skin</li>
<li> The women's REI Lightweight crew shirt features a next-to-skin fit that hugs the body and boosts fabric performance</li>
</ul>
