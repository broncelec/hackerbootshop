description_list: <h4>Whether you're skiing routine hardpack, sunbaked crud or the
  sweet untracked pow after a big storm, the K2 Annex 98 skis use a metal laminate
  and rockered tips so you can shred at high speed</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Dual titanal laminate offers unwavering stability at high speeds by absorbing bumps
  and responding quickly to high-speed maneuvers</li><li> Rockered tips initiate turns
  easily and offer agile performance on all kinds of terrain, and slight camber underfoot
  offers tenacious edge hold on firm snow</li><li> Lightweight aspen, paulownia and
  maple wood core produces a natural flex, allowing the ski to achieve full contact
  with the snow throughout the turn</li><li> The widest point of the tips is placed
  further back than on other K2 skis to reduce the tendency of skis to hook in light
  crust and throw you off balance</li><li> Slightly raised tails release easily during
  turns to reduce speed and avoid obstacles, and they make it easier to turn quickly
  when skiing concave-shaped couloirs and chutes</li><li> Use tip and tail holes to
  attach skins (sold separately); remove plugs with a flathead screwdriver</li><li>
  98mm waist requires bindings with wide brakes</li><li> Base or topsheet color may
  vary from online photo</li></ul>
