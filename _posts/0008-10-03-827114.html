<h3>The REI Crestrail 48 pack balances comfort with performance and durability for weekend or multiday trips</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Designed for women, it's the latest in light and compact design, materials and components</li>
<li> Sculpted FreeFlow back panel has multiple peaks and valleys to reduce sweaty contact areas and allow warm vapor to escape; soft foam conforms to your back for a stable fit</li>
<li> ActivMotion(R) hipbelt pivots to follow the natural motion of your hips, helping keep the pack balanced and stable on your back when hiking on uneven terrain</li>
<li> Hipbelt webbing tightens with a forward pull for easy adjustment; 2 zippered pockets provide handy access to snacks</li>
<li> Tubular aluminum perimeter frame is lighter than HDPE/stay frame sheets; it transfers weight to your hips and stabilizes the pack, helping prevent unwanted side-to-side sway</li>
<li> Top-loading main compartment also features a large zippered opening to the bottom for easy access</li>
<li> Large front pocket with double-zipper access, stretch stash pocket and lightweight lash points provide storage and organization for often-used gear and clothing</li>
<li> Side bottle-locking pockets secure bottles or other items, helping prevent them from falling out when bushwacking or taking your pack off</li>
<li> Quick Clip ice axe attachments are strategically positioned to avoid interference with pockets and access zippers</li>
<li> Over-the-top and dual side compression straps pull the load closer to your back, minimize bulk and provide external attachment points for gear</li>
<li> Floating top lid extends, allowing the pack to handle large loads</li>
<li> Ripstop nylon fabric resists abrasion and tears; Durable Water Resistant finish repels moisture</li>
<li> Water-repellent zippers help keep your contents dry and eliminate the need for fabric zipper flaps</li>
<li> Route your reservoir's drink tube over either shoulder (hydration reservoir sold separately)</li>
</ul>
