description_list: <h4>This Brooks Flyer bicycle saddle offers plenty of charm and
  comfort, thanks to real leather construction and springs for extra cushioning</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> Leather provides natural "give" by stretching and flexing,
  and because it doesn't need padding, it's a cool option in warm weather</li><li>
  The saddle will age and break in over time</li><li> Rear bag loops permit the use
  of a traditional English-style touring bag on the rear of the seat</li></ul>
