<h3>Using an innovation combination of goose down and synthetic insulation, the REI Flash women's sleeping bag uses the best of both worlds to bring you a lightweight bag that balances warmth and weight</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Down insulation is put on top of bag where it contributes the most warmth and loft; synthetic insulation on bottom of bag for a stable, moisture-resistant insulation layer</li>
<li> 800-fill-power goose down is efficiently distributed for maximum warmth and compressibility</li>
<li> Exclusive REI Down Fill Calculator optimizes the amount of down per baffle for the most warmth with the least amount of down</li>
<li> Soft PrimaLoft(R) Sport synthetic insulation feels like goose down but continues to work even if wet; dries quickly, too</li>
<li> In-the-round pattern wraps vertical baffles around perimeter of sleeping bag, from head to foot, creating a 3-dimensional bag that wraps you in warmth</li>
<li> Performance fit saves weight by reducing girth at shoulders, hips and lower legs while increasing thermal efficiency</li>
<li> Women-specific bags are cut to match a woman's shape, and provide extra insulation and warmth in the hood and feet areas</li>
<li> Baffle spacing allows the down to remain fully lofted and keeps it from shifting, preventing cold spots</li>
<li> Waterproof, breathable shell fabric is used on hood, side panels and footbox to increase moisture resistance in areas that often come in contact with tent side walls</li>
<li> Shell fabric is treated with a Durable Water Repellent finish to repel moisture and stains</li>
<li> Ultralight, mini-ripstop polyester lining has a soft hand feel and is comfortable against your skin</li>
<li> Multichambered contour hood, insulated full-face muffler, and full-length zipper draft tube with ground-level seams all work to keep heat in and cold out</li>
<li> Trapezoidal footbox mirrors sleeping position for room to move and thermal efficiency</li>
<li> Differentiated drawcords (1 round, 1 flat) let you adjust hood and neck easily in the dark</li>
</ul>
