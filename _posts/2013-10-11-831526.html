  Raised board tip cuts through the chop with ease</li><li> Soft traction pad offers
  solid grip when wet</li><li> 7 stainless-steel D-rings let you tie down gear on
  long paddles</li><li> Includes a hand pump with attached gauge</li><li> Removable

  Advanced Elements Hula 11 inflatable stand up paddleboard stows in included duffel
  bag when not in use; also includes a repair kit</li><li> Do not under inflate your
  SUP! Advanced Elements recommends inflate with a 12V electric pump, and then top
  off with a quality hand pump to get up to the recommended pressure</li></ul>
