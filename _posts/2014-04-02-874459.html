description_list: <h4>The MSR Mutha Hubba Tent is ideal for a minimalist trio backpacking
  deep into the Sierras in the heat of summer, or tackling the Appalachian Trail for
  an extended trip in the spring</h4><ul class="description"><li> Configured to maximize
  the tent's interior space, the strong and light hubbed pole system sets up easily</li><li>
  Vertical end panels help keep the tent wall from hitting the footbox of your sleeping
  bag-even for tall campers</li><li> Rainfly and floor fabrics balance weight and
  durability; you get a long-lasting, high performing tent that won't weigh you down</li><li>
  High-tech ripstop nylon rainfly reduces weight, and the silicon and polyurethane
  coating increases durability and resistance to damaging UV rays</li><li> 2 doors
  and 2 vestibules give each person easy access and personal gear storage</li><li>
  Stay-dry entries ensure water won't drip into the tent when door is opened for ventilation
  in rainy weather</li><li> Mesh canopy offers excellent ventilation in warm climates
  and the dark color is easy to see through with little or no distortion</li><li>
  Pockets at each end of tent help keep small items organized; hang loops inside tent
  provide points to hang your headlamp or damp clothes</li><li> Rainfly rolls back
  halfway for a great view on starry nights and quickly rolls down if clouds move
  in</li><li> Vestibule can be rolled back in either direction for maximum ventilation
  or, in strong rainstorms, can be left open at the bottom to facilitate ventilation</li><li>
  Taped seams; reinforced stress points; ultralight stake loops; user-friendly door
  toggles</li><li> Save weight and create a minimalist shelter by using just the rainfly,
  footprint (sold separately), poles and stakes</li><li> Includes stuff sacks, J-stakes
  and guyline/tighteners</li><li> Closeout</li></ul>
