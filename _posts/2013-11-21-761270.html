description_list: <h4>Often regarded as one of the fastest and most easily placed
  ice screws around, the Black Diamond Express ice screw bites into ice for quick
  and easy placement</h4><ul class="description"><li> Large crank knob is easier to
  grab than on previous models yet still offers uninterrupted 360deg motion without
  the use of an ice tool</li><li> Foldable, color-coded crank provides quick length
  identification</li><li> Stainless-steel hanger is lighter than previous models,
  won't rust and reduces melt-out on sunny routes</li><li> Large second clip-in point
  helps manage belay organization</li></ul>
