description_list: '<h4>The REI Lightweight Polartec(R) Power Dry(R) Half-Zip top for
  men can be worn as the first of several layers in colder temperatures or alone when
  you need less insulation</h4><ul class="description"><li> Polartec Power Dry uses
  2 different yarns on either side of the fabric to enhance comfort: interior yarn
  wicks moisture, and exterior yarn dries quickly</li><li> The combination of the
  2 yarns helps keep you dry during highly aerobic activities because it moves moisture
  away from skin faster than single-component fabrics such as cotton</li><li> Fabric
  protects skin against harmful ultraviolet light with a UPF rating of 20 and is very
  soft to the touch</li><li> Deep center front zipper allows ventilation control;
  features an inner draft flap and locking zipper head</li><li> Flatseam construction
  is soft and non-chafing next to skin; raglan sleeves with off-the-shoulder seams
  minimize irritation when wearing a pack</li><li> Underarm and side gussets promote
  freedom of motion</li><li> Dropped back hem stays tucked in</li><li> The REI Lightweight
  Polartec Power Dry Half-Zip top for men features a next-to-skin fit that hugs the
  body and boosts fabric performance</li></ul>'
