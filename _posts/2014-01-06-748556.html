description_list: <h4>Low-key styling and the supple feel of suede leather give these
  classic flip-flops a nicer look than the standard black</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Quality suede leather straps with polyester lining softly cradle insteps and resist
  stretching; pliable polyester between the toes is comfortable</li><li> On size 9K/10K
  only, polyester heel straps slip over small heels to keep flip-flops from flip-flopping
  right off</li><li> Suede leather footbeds are contoured for arch support and perforated
  for quick drying</li><li> Triple-density EVA topsoles with contoured arches and
  EVA midsoles support cradle and cushion feet</li><li> High density EVA outsoles
  provide excellent traction on all kinds of surfaces</li></ul>
