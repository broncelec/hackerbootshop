description_list: <h4>When you want very little to come between you and the trail,
  the women's minimalist Brooks PureGrit 2 Trail-Running Shoes won't get in your way,
  but they'll be sure to give you a stable ride</h4><ul class="description"><li> 4mm
  heel-to-toe drop encourages a natural midfoot or forefoot strike to promote forward
  momentum and reduce the impact of heel striking</li><li> Ideal Heel design uses
  a curved heel to encourage foot contact points to shift you forward, helping align
  joints and reduce stresses</li><li> Split toe groove under the forefoot offers a
  sense of connection to the ground</li><li> Lightweight uppers feature conforming
  synthetic leather overlays, highly breathable mesh and a rubber instep band to provide
  a comfortable, secure fit regardless of foot shape</li><li> Uppers have been reworked
  to give you a more comfortable midfoot wrap than on the previous version of the
  PureGrit</li><li> Midsoles feature BioMoGo polymer alloy foam, which provides cushioning,
  energy return and reduced foot fatigue; nontoxic additive helps midsoles break down
  in landfill</li><li> Brooks PureGrit 2 Trail-Running Shoes have 1-piece rubber outsoles
  that have a concave shape and aggressive lug pattern for a stable ride on the trails</li></ul>
