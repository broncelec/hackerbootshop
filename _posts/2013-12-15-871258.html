description_list: <h4>The men's Pendulum Trail-Running Shoes from Vasque strike the
  perfect balance between a lightweight minimalist design and enough padding and support
  to tackle rocky trails</h4><ul class="description"><li> Shoes keep the foot close
  to the ground and optimally positioned for natural forefoot strike</li><li> At the
  same time, an EVA midsole and TPU plate protect the runner from the occasional hard
  heel strike or wayward stone</li><li> Bonded upper minimizes hot spots, while a
  toothy outsole maximizes miles over sketchy terrain</li><li> Pendulum Trail-Running
  Shoes are the lightest-weight trail running shoes made by Vasque</li><li> Closeout</li></ul>
