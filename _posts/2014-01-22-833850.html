description_list: <h4>The Klymit Inertia X-Frame sleeping pad features a unique cut
  out design and high pressurized comfort that makes it one of the thinnest, lightest
  and most compact sleeping pads</h4><ul class="description"><li> Klymit uses body
  mapping to support the key areas, such as the head and hips, and removes padding
  in less critical areas to reduce weight</li><li> Cutouts allow a bag's insulation
  to remain lofted, which maximizes warmth, rather than becoming compacted between
  your body and the pad</li><li> Inertia X-Frame pad can be inflated with just 2 -
  4 breaths; to adjust firmness, use the included hand pump to increase air pressure
  in pad</li><li> Use it under or inside (so you'll never fall off) your sleeping
  bag</li><li> Pad includes a stuff sack, patch kit and dry air pump</li><li> Klymit
  Inertia X-Frame sleeping pad rolls up to the sized of a soda can for easy packing</li><li>
  Constructed from 30-denier ripstop nylon top and a 75-denier polyester bottom for
  durability</li></ul>
