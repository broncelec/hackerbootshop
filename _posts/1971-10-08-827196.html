<ul class="description">
<li> This lightweight jacket is engineered to withstand severe rain and styled for everyday use</li>
<li> The Venture jacket is a staple that every outdoor enthusiast will appreciate</li>
<li> HyVent(R) EC 2</li>
<li>5-layer substitutes natural (bean-derived) castor oil for 50% of the petroleum-based materials previously used in the manufacturing process</li>
<li> HyVent EC maintains excellent waterproof, breathable performance; it's ideal for spring skiing and snowboarding, as well as urban and city hiking</li>
<li> HyVent is lightweight and packable, moves easily over layers and is more breathable than unlined, treated fabrics</li>
<li> All seams are sealed for complete protection</li>
<li> Fully adjustable brimmed hood (with hidden drawcords) protects your head from precipitation and allows good visibility; soft lining guards chin against abrasion</li>
<li> Rip-and-stick stormflap prevents weather penetration through the full-length front zipper</li>
<li> Pit zippers allow cooling airflow as your activity heats up</li>
<li> Hem drawcord and elastic cuffs with rip-and-stick closures seal out the weather</li>
<li> Zip hand pockets; jacket stows in left pocket</li>
<li> The Venture jacket's regular cut eases layering, and slightly long length adds protection</li>
