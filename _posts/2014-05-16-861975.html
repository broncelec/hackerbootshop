description_list: <h4>Built for precision on groomed runs, the advanced-level K2 AMP
  Bolt skis with bindings combine slight rocker with burly construction to produce
  unshakeble hold during sweeping, GS-style turns</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Combination of a strong core, shock-absorbent secondary core and X-shaped carbon
  support creates skis with tenacious grip on hardpack and instant side-to-side response</li><li>
  Metal laminate construction alternates layers of fiberglass and titanium above and
  below the fir core to provide vibration damping and powerful responsiveness</li><li>
  Typically a super-beefy ski like the Bolt would be unforgiving and tough to turn,
  but K2 has added a very slight rise in the tips to aid in turning</li><li> Rocker
  designed for speed initiates turns easily and offers agile performance, and normal
  camber underfoot offers responsive power and strong edge hold on firm snow</li><li>
  Lightweight integrated binding system acts on a wide surface area, transferring
  power directly to the skis' edges for excellent carving and control during aggressive
  descents</li><li> K2 AMP Bolt skis with bindings feature DIN 5 - 14 release settings,
  a range suited to advanced skiers at high speeds</li><li> Base or topsheet color
  may vary from online photo</li></ul>
