description_list: <h4>Warm enough for winter, the down-insulated Furnace 5 Sleeping
  Bag from The North Face has a less-tapered cut than a standard backpacking bag,
  giving you more room to relax on your adventures</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  With a European Norm (EN) lower-limit rating of 9degF, the Furnace 5 is a versatile
  bag for year-round backpacking adventures when temps dip into the single digits</li><li>
  550-fill-power ProDown(TM) natural goose down insulation is light and lofty</li><li>
  ProDown(TM) is enhanced with a hydrophobic finish that improves warmth by allowing
  it to dry faster and repel moisture up to 10 times longer than untreated down</li><li>
  Anti-compression pads made from Heatseeker(TM) Eco synthetic insulation are sewn
  into high-pressure areas that contact the ground to create an insulating buffer</li><li>
  Shaped hood and down-insulated draft collar hold in warmth</li><li> Insulated draft
  tube backs the zipper to prevent warm air from escaping; antisnag tape keeps the
  zipper from catching on the draft tube</li><li> 3/4-length, 2-way zipper lets you
  make adjustments for ventilation</li><li> Comfort-oriented shape has a less-tapered
  cut than some backpacking sleeping bags, allowing you more room to move around</li><li>
  Footbox allows natural foot movement while also eliminating excess lateral space
  so you stay warm and comfortable all night long</li><li> The North Face Furnace
  5 Sleeping Bag comes with a compression stuff sack and a storage sack</li><li> European
  Norm (EN) is an independent third-party temperature rating, allowing accurate comparisons
  across brands with other EN-rated bags</li></ul>
