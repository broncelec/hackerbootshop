description_list: <h4>The Eddyline Caribbean 12 sit-on-top kayak glides through the
  water with a high-quality hull construction and top-notch features</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Unique hull construction offers the looks and performance of a composite kayak with
  the durability of plastic</li><li> Named Carbonite 2000 by Eddyline, a co-extruded
  ABS laminate creates a hull that rivals the qualities of fiberglass</li><li> Plastic
  is first shaped into a 2-layer sheet with durable interior and an abrasion- and
  UV-resistant exterior</li><li> Dheet is then thermorformed into the hull of the
  kayak using very high temperatures and a vacuum</li><li> This 2-layer plastic laminate
  offers incredible stiffness and a hard, glossy appearance that resists abrasion
  and impact while remaining easy to repair</li><li> Gull wing hull configuration
  provides high initial stability without sacrificing its excellent tracking or efficient
  forward motion through the water</li><li> High-backed adjustable seat provides additional
  comfort for longer paddling excursions</li><li> Removable seat includes fittings
  made from tough but lightweight plastic instead of the typical metal buckles that
  can scratch up your kayak</li><li> Multiple hatches provide access to interior space;
  flat and accessible mounting surfaces provide ample space for mounting accessories</li></ul>
