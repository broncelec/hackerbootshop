description_list: <h4>With its high-angle blade, fiberglass-and-carbon construction
  and lightweight design, the Werner Tybee is aggressive on the water but easy on
  the wallet</h4><ul class="description"><li> Fiberglass-and-carbon blended shaft
  is lightweight and rugged; a slight amount of flex increases comfort and reduces
  strain</li><li> Adjustable Ferrule System allows elegant adjustment of feathering
  angle from 0deg - 60deg right or left in 15deg increments</li><li> Improved ferrule
  design incorporates internal printing of offset degrees and a low-profile button
  release that makes paddle feel like 1 piece</li><li> Injection-molded blades are
  constructed with fiberglass-reinforced nylon, offering a lighter swing weight than
  plastic blades</li><li> High-angle blades with powerful catches feature a slight
  dihedral shape and excel at smooth linking strokes and advanced techniques</li><li>
  Asymmetrical blade shape helps reduce torque, allowing paddle to pull smoothly through
  the water and reducing the need to grip tightly</li><li> Light swing weight reduces
  overall fatigue on long paddling excursions</li><li> Drip rings help keep hands
  and lap dry</li><li> Design is optimized for high-angle paddling style</li><li>
  2-piece design breaks down quickly and eases transport and storage</li></ul>
