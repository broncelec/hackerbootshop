description_list: <h4>The fusion of luxury and light weight come together perfectly
  in the 2-person, 3-season Sierra Designs Flash 2 Tent</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  It defies belief about how light a full-size, full-featured shelter can be</li><li>
  Hybrid double/single wall reduces weight and provides quick, dry setup, even in
  the rain; freestanding design can be pitched anywhere, no matter how impenetrable
  the surface</li><li> Symmetric dome shape allows for both head-to-head and head-to-toe
  sleeping configurations; high ceiling accommodates thicker mattresses with plenty
  of headroom</li><li> Immense interior space allows occupants to sit at either end
  with room in between for a comfortable game of cards</li><li> The Sierra Designs
  Flash 2 Tent features 2 drop doors that are uncommonly wide and large enough for
  2 people to sit side by side</li><li> DAC Pressfit(R) poles feature a securely fixed,
  pressed-in ferrule, ensuring the poles will remain strong and reliable</li><li>
  15 in</li><li> integrated awning poles maximize the door openings and drip lines
  without the extra weight of an additional support pole</li><li> 2 gear closets store
  gear away from the door; gear closets help keep gear dry in a rainstorm, whether
  closed or left open for additional venting</li></ul>
