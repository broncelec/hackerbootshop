description_list: '<h4>The lofty 800-fill-power Sierra Designs Backcountry Bed 800
  2-Season Sleeping Bag has an integrated comforter and zero zippers for a unique
  outdoor sleeping experience through spring and summer</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Climb into the bag via the large oval opening on top; the oversize comforter seals
  up the opening so you can sleep comfortably no matter your position: back, side
  or stomach</li><li> With a European Norm (EN) lower-limit rating of 29degF, the
  Backcountry Bed 800 2 -Season sleeping bag is suitable for spring and summer backpacking</li><li>
  On warmer nights, flip the comforter outside the sleeping bag and tuck it back for
  ventilation; insulated hand/arm pockets provide warmth when the comforter is outside
  the bag</li><li> Down is considered the best insulation available but when wet,
  it quickly loses loft and the ability to keep you warm; 800-fill-power DriDown is
  treated to resist moisture</li><li> Proprietary process treats each individual duck
  down plume with a molecular-level polymer so the down stays dry longer, lofts better
  and dries faster than untreated down</li><li> DriDown insulation stays dry 10 times
  longer, retains 170% more loft when exposed to moisture and dries 33% faster than
  untreated down</li><li> Ripstop polyester exterior endures frequent use in the outdoors;
  polyester taffeta lining is soft and comfortable next to skin</li><li> Sleeping
  pad sleeve on the bottom of the bag secures your pad (pad sold separately) to create
  the experience of a fully integrated bed</li><li> Sierra Designs Backcountry Bed
  800 2-Season Sleeping Bag comes with a stuff sack and storage sack</li><li> European
  Norm (EN) is an independent third-party temperature rating, allowing accurate comparisons
  across brands with other EN-rated bags</li></ul>'
