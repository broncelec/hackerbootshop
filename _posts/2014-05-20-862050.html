description_list: <h4>Simplified and streamlined, yet outfitted with all the features
  needed for fast, accurate searches, the Pieps DSP Sport avalanche transceiver is
  as easy to use as it is powerful</h4><ul class="description"><li> Three-antenna
  system pinpoints the location of burials within a 50m range regardless of antenna
  orientation and burial depth</li><li> In a multiple-burial scenario, the unit works
  to transmit a signal without overlapping other signals</li><li> Eliminating signal
  overlap allows the searcher to quickly interpret the audible and visual information
  with increased accuracy and less confusion</li><li> Digital Signal Processing (DSP)
  technology displays the number of buried victims as stick figures on an easy-to-view
  LCD screen</li><li> When signals are detected, the approximate distance and direction
  to the burials are immediately displayed-simply follow the arrows to reach a burial</li><li>
  Upon locating the position of the first victim, the searcher can mark and mask the
  found signal and immediately begin searching for other burials; DSP Sport marks
  one signal</li><li> Self-check tests all major functions as the transceiver is powering
  on, including transmitting frequency and operation of antennas, amplifiers, processors
  and batteries</li><li> Adjustable, nylon harness with pouch keeps the unit secure
  and accessible</li><li> Compatible with all transceivers operating on the 457 kHz
  frequency</li><li> Can be used with Pieps iProbe (sold separately); iProbe can temporarily
  suppress the signal of a transmitting Pieps transceiver to make searching for multiple
  burials easier</li><li> Pieps DSP Sport avalanche transceiver operates on 3 AAA
  batteries, included</li><li> Software can be updated via USB (cable not included)</li></ul>
