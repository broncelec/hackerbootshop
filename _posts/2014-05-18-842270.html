description_list: <h4>The Black Diamond Quadrant randonee boots bring the downhill
  performance of a freeride boot together with the light weight of a touring boot
  so you can take your big skis into the backcountry</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Quadrant boots have been redesigned for a better fit and now feature liners with
  articulation zones and plastic tongues for a smooth, even flex</li><li> Triple-injected,
  multidensity shells use Pebax plastic for a progressive flex; 120 flex index is
  hearty enough to drive big skis down steep lines</li><li> Lightweight liners are
  comfortable out of the box, but can be custom molded for a more accurate fit; include
  smooth antimicrobial lining material for easy on and off</li><li> Boa Lacing System
  provides liners a precise and personalized fit that is simple to adjust with the
  turn of a dial; Boa holds laces tight and secure</li><li> Built on 103mm lasts,
  the liners have roomy toe boxes for touring comfort and good warmth</li><li> Tech
  components in front and back allow the boots to work with Dynafit-style randonee
  bindings; Quadrant boots are also compatible with step-in style randonee bindings</li><li>
  4 micro-adjustable buckles and an improved power strap on each boot close the boots
  comfortably and securely around the feet and legs</li><li> Ski/walk switches are
  hassle free with a simple on/off toggle; ski mode locks you into a forward lean
  position that can be set from 14deg to 22deg</li><li> Walk mode provides a 40deg
  range of resistance-free motion for comfort while hiking</li><li> Black Diamond
  Quadrant boots feature rockered rubber outsoles for good grip on snow and rock</li></ul>
