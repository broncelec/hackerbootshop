description_list: <h4>A superb blend of performance and cargo capacity, Delta TwentyT
  will forever change the way you think about tandem kayaks! Thermoformed ABS plastic
  hull material is stiff and light like traditional composite kayaks and with similar
  looks, but costs considerably less</h4><ul class="description"><li> Acrylic Solarkote(TM)
  protects the high gloss and color of the kayak from UV rays</li><li> Hull shape
  enhances primary stability without compromising secondary stability or manuverability,
  even when fully loaded for long trips</li><li> Seats are adjustable forward and
  backward even while paddling so the trim of the kayak can be adjusted on the move</li><li>
  Cockpit-deployable aluminum rudder system enhances tracking while minimizing side-slipping
  and helping with steering when you need it</li><li> 4 bulkheads create 3 expedition-sized
  hatches to add buoyancy and keep all your gear dry during long trips or day paddles</li><li>
  Hardshell, recessed hatch covers with neoprene hatch seals are secured via bungee
  closures</li><li> Neoprene-padded seat and adjustable backband offer comfort and
  support on long trips; neoprene padding on thigh bracing improves comfort and control</li><li>
  Cockpit-adjustable foot braces fit most paddlers and feature a locking mechanism
  to disable rudder control movement</li><li> Bungee deck rigging at bow and stern
  retains extra gear</li><li> Ergonomic rubber grab handles are easy on hands and
  make car-topping and transport to the water a snap</li></ul>
