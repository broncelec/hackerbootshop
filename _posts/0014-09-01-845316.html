description_list: <h3>Using an innovation combination of goose down and synthetic
  insulation, the REI Flash women's sleeping bag uses the best of both worlds to bring
  you a lightweight bag that balances warmth and weight</h3><ul class="description"><li>
  Down insulation is put on top of bag where it contributes the most warmth and loft;
  synthetic insulation on bottom of bag for a stable, moisture-resistant insulation
  layer</li><li> 800-fill-power goose down is efficiently distributed for maximum
  warmth and compressibility</li><li> Exclusive REI Down Fill Calculator optimizes
  the amount of down per baffle for the most warmth with the least amount of down</li><li>
  Soft PrimaLoft(R) Sport synthetic insulation feels like goose down but continues
  to work even if wet; dries quickly, too</li><li> In-the-round pattern wraps vertical
  baffles around perimeter of sleeping bag, from head to foot, creating a 3-dimensional
  bag that wraps you in warmth</li><li> Performance fit saves weight by reducing girth
  at shoulders, hips and lower legs while increasing thermal efficiency</li><li> Women-specific
  bags are cut to match a woman's shape, and provide extra insulation and warmth in
  the hood and feet areas</li><li> Baffle spacing allows the down to remain fully
  lofted and keeps it from shifting, preventing cold spots</li><li> Waterproof, breathable
  shell fabric is used on hood, side panels and footbox to increase moisture resistance
  in areas that often come in contact with tent side walls</li><li> Shell fabric is
  treated with a Durable Water Repellent finish to repel moisture and stains</li><li>
  Ultralight, mini-ripstop polyester lining has a soft hand feel and is comfortable
  against your skin</li><li> Multichambered contour hood, insulated full-face muffler,
  and full-length zipper draft tube with ground-level seams all work to keep heat
  in and cold out</li><li> Trapezoidal footbox mirrors sleeping position for room
  to move and thermal efficiency</li><li> Differentiated drawcords (1 round, 1 flat)
  let you adjust hood and neck easily in the dark</li></ul>
