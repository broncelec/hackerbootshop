  Polarized sunglasses</h4><ul class="description"><li> Unlike low-quality imitations,

  yet durable frames are built to withstand a high-velocity impact</li><li> Frames
  endure extreme highs and lows in temperature</li><li> Self-adjusting nosepads and
  ear stems create a nonslip grip that keeps sunglasses in place</li><li> Temple ends
  hug your ears to keep sunglasses in place</li><li> Cam-action spring hinges quickly
  lock temples into position</li><li> Native Eyewear Highline polarized sunglasses
  include a protective case and a soft pouch that doubles as a cleaning cloth</li><li>
