description_list: <h4>With nimble, lightweight construction for tight trees and icy
  chutes, plus rockered tips to float in powder, the women's K2 SuperBright 102 skis
  are designed to explore backside terrain</h4><ul class="description"><li> Rockered
  tips initiate turns easily and offer agile performance in deep snow, and slight
  camber underfoot offers tenacious edge hold on firm snow</li><li> K2 women's skis
  reduce the bulk and weight of all components to create very lightweight skis suited
  to the specific needs of female skiers</li><li> Stiff enough for high speeds and
  fast turns, the Bioflex2 core combines aspen, paulownia and bamboo to deliver light
  weight and responsive performance</li><li> A fiberglass weave around the wood core
  provides torsional stiffness for highly responsive turning, and a web of carbon
  fiber located in the tips and tails increases edge hold</li><li> Cap construction
  contributes to light skis that are easy to maneuver</li><li> Use tip and tail holes
  to attach skins (sold separately); remove plugs with a flathead screwdriver</li><li>
  102mm waists require bindings with wide brakes</li><li> Base or topsheet color may
  vary from online photo</li></ul>
