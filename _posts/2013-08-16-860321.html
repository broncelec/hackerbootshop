description_list: <h4>Using the latest ski tech to significantly reduce weight, Volkl
  has updated the fully rockered V-Werks Katana skis so they'll blaze through powder
  atop wide, 112mm waists</h4><ul class="description"><li> Made of lightweight Paulonia
  wood, the milled-out cores reduce overall weight and make it easy to turn, smear
  pillows, dump speed or skid past an obstacle in pow</li><li> Stiff carbon fiber
  reinforcement around the core creates a thin profile at the tip and sides that cuts
  through deep powder snow and enhances maneuverability and response</li><li> 112mm
  waists float easily in the deepest pow, and full rocker increases maneuverability
  and adds a surflike, floaty feel</li><li> The smooth, gradual rocker from tip to
  tail also creates uninterrupted edge contact on groomed runs, ripping graceful arcs
  in corduroy on your way back to the base</li><li> The full rocker profile is subtle
  compared to that of other powder-specific Volkl skis, and it enhances maneuverability
  at high speeds</li><li> Low tip smooths out your ride on the groomed runs and resists
  diving in soft snow</li><li> Vertical sidewalls provide excellent grip, stability
  and sensitivity</li><li> Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li><li>
  Volkl V-Werks Katana skis require bindings with wide brakes</li></ul>
