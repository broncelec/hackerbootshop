description_list: <h4>The ultralight women's REI Flash Sleeping Bag uses a clever
  hybrid of water-repellent insulations and waterproof/breathable fabric panels in
  its double-protection design</h4><ul class="description"><li> With a European Norm
  (EN) comfort rating of 32degF, this bag is suitable for 3-season use</li><li> REI
  double-protection design combines water-repellent fills with waterproof/breathable
  fabric at the hood, sides and footbox, the areas most likely to touch a damp tent
  wall</li><li> Designed to fit a woman's body, this bag offers increased room at
  hips, decreased room at shoulders and extra insulation in critical heat-loss areas</li><li>
  On top of the bag, where superior loft and warmth are key, is water-repellent 700-fill-power
  duck down</li><li> On the bottom is resilient Primaloft(R) Sport insulation, which
  performs well in a compressed under-bag space</li><li> Ripstop nylon shell also
  features a durable water repellent (DWR) finish to further protect the bag's insulations</li><li>
  Performance fit keeps weight low and thermal efficiency high</li><li> REI in-the-round
  design puts vertical baffles in side walls to wrap you in warmth and create a better
  fit than bags that use only horizontal baffles</li><li> Contoured hood, insulated
  face muffler and full-length draft tube all work to keep warmth in</li><li> Differentiated
  hood and neck drawcords simplify adjustments; antisnag zipper works smoothly</li><li>
  Any REI backpacking bag can be zipped to any other REI backpacking bag; women's
  bags zip on the right, men's on the left</li><li> The women's REI Flash Sleeping
  Bag includes a nylon stuff sack and a large cotton storage bag</li><li> European
  Norm (EN) is an independent third-party temperature rating, allowing accurate comparisons
  across brands with other EN-rated bags</li></ul>
