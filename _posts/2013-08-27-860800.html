description_list: <h4>A speedy ride with nimble 87mm waists and rockered tips and
  tails, the women's Atomic Supreme skis shred groomed runs with authority and confidence-inspiring
  stability</h4><ul class="description"><li> When skis are weighted, there is a slight
  rise in the tips that makes it easy to initiate turns</li><li> When skis are put
  on edge after starting a turn, the camber flattens out to deliver full-length contact
  with snow and excellent edge hold</li><li> Wood core provide smooth handling at
  high speeds and in deep powder, and carbon "backbone" insert enhances edge grip
  and reduces vibrations for excellent stability</li><li> Sidewall construction ensures
  maximum torsional rigidity, uncanny edge grip and controlled tip-to-tail flex; sidewall
  is reinforced in binding area with 3 layers of material</li><li> Half cap construction
  in tip and tail reduces swing weight and chipping when your skis bang together</li><li>
  The women's Atomic Supreme skis features a directional sidecut that favors skiing
  forward but allows you to ski and land jumps backward</li><li> Base or topsheet
  color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
