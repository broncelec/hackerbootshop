  finish causes water to bead up and roll off, fending off melting snow to help keep
  you dry</li><li> Synthetic insulation, 90% of which is recycled material, is placed
  in critical areas to provide insulating warmth, even if it gets damp; it also compresses
  for compact stowing</li><li> Embedded RECCO(R) reflector enhances radio signals
  from search-and-rescue RECCO detectors, helping speed up the search for a buried
  avalanche victim</li><li> Polyester lining helps move sweat away from your body
  and glides smoothly over base layers; mesh-backed thigh vents let you release excess
  body heat while keeping snow out</li><li> Brushed lining on waistband wicks sweat
  and provides against-the-skin comfort; zip-fly, 2-snap closure and adjustable waistband
  tabs provide a personalized fit</li><li> Snow gaiters securely wrap around boots
