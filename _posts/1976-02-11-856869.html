<li> Linings feature soft pigskin leather and recycled PET mesh</li>
<li> Supportive, compression-molded removable footbeds are made from partially recycled EVA</li>
<li> Lightweight, durable Vibram(R) Christy outsoles have a vintage look and rugged lugs for grip; they offer good stability and cushioning on a variety of surfaces</li>
