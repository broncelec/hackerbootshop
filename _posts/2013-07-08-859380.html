description_list: <h4>Light like a pair of backcountry touring skis but designed for
  the resort with rockered tips and tails, the women's Rossignol Saffron 7 skis take
  on any terrain on the mountain in any snow condition</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  The Saffron 7 skis are right at home lapping freshly fallen powder or blasting through
  crud, and they carve responsively on hardpack snow and groomed runs</li><li> Float
  like a feather on top of deep snow thanks to the rockered tips and tails; redesigned
  Powder Turn rocker minimizes the tendency of tips to flap at high speeds</li><li>
  Standard camber underfoot offers tenacious edge-grip on hardpack; there's more than
  enough camber to enjoy carving on groomers</li><li> Lightweight wood core strikes
  a balance between manueverability and strength</li><li> You'll really appreciate
  the weight savings when the Saffron 7 skis are strapped to your pack and you hike
  up the ridge to get first tracks</li><li> The responsive strength of the skis shines
  when dropping into steep terrain, negotiating a technical line, and straight-lining
  it back to the base</li><li> 98mm waists require bindings with wide brakes</li><li>
  Base or topsheet color may vary from photo</li></ul>
