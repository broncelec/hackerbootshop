<h3>The North Face Kallispell Triclimate jacket gives you three ways to beat winter weather: the waterproof, insulated shell and heavyweight fleece liner sweater can be worn together or separately</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> What makes this Triclimate unique is that it's designed in a longer length and the shell fabric has a heathered look, giving it a more urban appeal</li>
<li> HyVent(R) shell is waterproof and breathable and insulated with Heatseeker(TM) insulation, offering a great warmth-to-weight ratio and is highly durable and compressible</li>
<li> Heatseeker fill is varied to reduce bulk: 80g in body, 60g in sleeves and hood</li>
<li> The North Face Kallispell Triclimate jacket features a removable, adjustable hood and pit zips so you can customize the warmth to your activity level</li>
<li> 300-weight sweater fleece has zippered handwarmer pockets</li>
<li> Shell offers zippered hand pockets and an internal media pocket</li>
</ul>
