description_list: ! '<h3>The quiet REI Traverse Shocklight trekking poles provide
  stability and support so you hear the sounds of nature and not the clicks of your
  poles</h3><ul class="description"><li> Shock-absorbing poles reduce fatigue while
  improving stability; lockout mechanism creates a rigid pole when needed for more
  efficient climbing</li><li> Shocklight shock absorbers weigh less than common spring-loaded
  mechanisms and won''t rattle within the shaft as you walk</li><li> Internal twist-lock
  mechanisms apply a wide area of pressure against pole walls to lock in length adjustment</li><li>
  With the Stop Lock system, poles won''t come apart; system makes the pole sections
  into 1 unit for security and stability</li><li> Twist-locking pole sections let
  you tailor the length to fit your terrain: make them shorter for the way up, longer
  for the way down</li><li> Strong 7075-T6 aluminum, 3-section telescoping poles extend
  to a maximum length of 55</li><li>1 in</li><li> and compact to 27</li><li>5 in</li><li>
