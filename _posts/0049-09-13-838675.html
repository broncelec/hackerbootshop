<h3>The REI Tech-Compatible Switchback gloves are built tough to keep hands dry and warm while you're skiing couloirs and climbing peaks</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Waterproof, breathable REI Elements(R) inserts keep hands dry while you backcountry ski, traverse glaciers and play in the snow</li>
<li> Removable fleece liners keep hands warm in winter; wear just the liner gloves for jobs requiring greater dexterity</li>
<li> Conductive material at the tips of the thumbs and index fingers on the liner gloves allows you to send text messages and operate your touch-screen phone with the gloves on</li>
<li> Grippy palms handle ice tools and ski poles with ease</li>
<li> Soft fabric on the thumbs gives you a gentle place to wipe your nose</li>
<li> Wrist cinches and gauntlet closures are easy to operate with 1 hand</li>
<li> Removable leashes secure the REI Tech-Compatible Switchback gloves to your wrists so you won't lose them</li>
</ul>
