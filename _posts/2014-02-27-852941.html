description_list: <h4>Whether an aspiring amateur or a seasoned pro rider, the CycleOps
  Aluminum Rollers with Resistance help improve your balance and bike handling skills,
  and your cardio while you're at it</h4><ul class="description"><li> Precision-lathed
  aluminum drums supply a smooth ride with excellent real-world feel; because your
  bike isn't locked onto a trainer, balance and handling skills are required</li><li>
  Adjustable resistance unit uses a magnetic bar behind the rear roller to provide
  5 levels of resistance, so you can increase the intensity of your training as needed</li><li>
  Because the resistance is provided through magnets, there's no additional noise
  and no moving parts to break down; resistance is set manually while off the bike</li><li>
  Flat steel frame withstands the rigors of frequent use and transport; tool-free
  roller adjustment accommodates different wheelbase widths</li><li> Rubber foot pads
  secure your rollers so you can enjoy a stable ride</li><li> Place the belt connecting
  the 2 front roller drums on the left or right side to accommodate your preferred
  side for mounting and dismounting</li><li> Since mastering the rollers can take
  a few tries, the generous 16 in</li><li> width of the drums gives you room to move
  around as you fine-tune your skills</li><li> CycleOps Alumium Rollers can be conveniently
  folded up for grab-and-go transport or compact storage</li></ul>
