description_list: <h4>Katadyn Vario water filter has a 2-mode design that lets you
  opt between fast filtration or extended lifetime of the primary filter (up to 500
  gallons!)</h4><ul class="description"><li> Vario features a 2-filter system; 1 is
  a 0</li><li>3-micron, pleated glassfiber filter used to remove waterborne bacteria
  and cysts</li><li> Secondary ceramic filter, engaged with a simple twist of the
