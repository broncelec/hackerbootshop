<h3>With soft, quick-drying stretch fabric, excellent sun protection and thumbhole cuffs that hold sleeves in place, the REI Venturi Quarter-Zip top is ideal for cool-weather workouts and trail hikes</h3>
<ul class="description">

<li> With a UPF 50+ rating, fabric provides excellent protection against harmful ultraviolet rays</li>
<li> Thumbholes keep sleeves in place during activity or while layering under gloves or coats; mock neck provides extra coverage but a deep front zipper promotes ventilation</li>
