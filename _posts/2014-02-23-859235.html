description_list: <h4>An all-mountain powerhouse that takes on terrain with confidence,
  the Salomon Q-90 skis use rockered tips and tails and a light wood core to take
  intermediate off-piste skills to the next level</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Rockered profile excels in soft snow and delivers fluid performance on hardpack;
  when put on edge, 95% of edge length contacts the snow for precision on groomed
  runs</li><li> Full wood core delivers direct transmission of power with precision
  and efficiency</li><li> Elastomer inserts placed over the edges absorb vibrations,
  resulting in a smooth ride that softens ski-to-snow contact</li><li> Fiber reinforcements
  laid directly on the edges add torsional rigidity and improve edge durability, and
  wide metal edges withstand big impacts and improve shock resistance</li><li> The
  Salomon Q-90 skis require bindings with wide brakes</li><li> Base or topsheet color
  may vary from online photo</li></ul>
