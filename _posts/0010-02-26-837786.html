description_list: <h4>The boys' REI Balaclava furnishes young faces with warmth</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> It's ideal for snow play in extreme cold that calls for
  more coverage than a beanie</li><li> Midweight polyester fabric on the top is warm,
  breathable and moisture-wicking, and fits nicely under a helmet; microfleece on
  the bottom is soft and warm against the skin</li><li> Face opening can be pulled
  down to the chin, letting a boy eat his baklava without removing his balaclava</li></ul>
