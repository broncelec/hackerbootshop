description_list: <h4>A rugged, lightweight bag with lofty 700-fill goose down, the
  Marmot Alpha Sleeping Bag will provide years of 3-season use for weekend backpacking
  trips in the mountains</h4><ul class="description"><li> With a European Norm (EN)
  lower-limit rating of 27degF, the Alpha sleeping bag is suitable for 3-season use
  when temperatures dip just below freezing</li><li> Bag is filled with certified,
  lofty, lightweight 700-fill-power goose down for a great warmth-to-weight ratio</li><li>
  Down is treated to resist moisture to maintain warmth; treated down stays drier
  10 times longer, maintains 150% more loft and dries 30% faster than untreated down</li><li>
  Nautilus 3D 6-baffle hood envelops your head in warmth; down gasket face muff allows
  hood to be cinched snug without digging into your face</li><li> Down-insulated draft
  collar and down-filled draft tube backing the snag-free zipper seal out cold air</li><li>
  Ground-level side seams eliminate cold air leaks and allow the goose down insulation
  to loft fully</li><li> Trapezoidal footbox is wider in the toe area and narrower
  in the heels to match the shape of your feet</li><li> Stretch tricot baffles allow
  the bag to be stuffed and unstuffed without tearing the baffle material</li><li>
  Zipper guards prevent zipper snags; locking zippers keep bag from opening if you
  toss and turn at night</li><li> Marmot Alpha Sleeping Bag comes with a storage sack</li><li>
  European Norm (EN) is an independent third-party temperature rating, allowing accurate
  comparisons across brands with other EN-rated bags</li></ul>
