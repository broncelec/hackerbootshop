<h3>Perfect for training when it gets chilly, the women's Impulse Active Quarter-Zip top from The North Face uses moisture-wicking FlashDry(TM) polyester fabric for fast drying and great breathability</h3>
<ul class="description">

<li> The North Face Impulse quarter-zip shirt features a zippered chest pocket to stash workout accessories</li>
<li> Raglan sleeves offer a comfortable, nonbinding fit; thumbholes keep sleeves over hands and wrists for greater warmth</li>
<li> Hem is slightly longer in back than front, increasing coverage for active sports</li>
<li> Flatlock seams reduce chafing and increase durability</li>
<li> The North Face women's Impulse Active Quarter-Zip top feature reflective highlights to increase visibility in low light</li>
</ul>
