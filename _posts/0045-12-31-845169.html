<h3>The Alpine Project jacket for men from The North Face feels featherweight but you'll be knocked out by its heavy-duty performance</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> New Gore-Tex(R) Active reduces weight without sacrificing quality</li>
<li> Gore-Tex Active is 30% lighter than comparable Gore-Tex fabrics, meaning your load up to the summit can be lighter than you planned</li>
<li> The Alpine Project jacket is waterproof and seam-sealed but still extremely breathable for total comfort even during aerobic activity</li>
<li> Close-fitting hood easily adjusts with hidden cord locks; laminated brim adds protection and still fits comfortably under a helmet</li>
<li> 2 front zippered pockets help you secure your essentials and sit high on the torso for harness and pack compatibility</li>
<li> Underarm zippers allow for venting and better temperature control</li>
<li> The North Face Alpine Project jacket features nonabrasive adjustable cuff tabs and a hem cinch cord to block out the elements</li>
<li> The North Face Summit Series(TM) apparel is designed and tested for use in harsh conditions</li>
</ul>
