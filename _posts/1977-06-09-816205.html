<h3>The North Face Etip Facet gloves prevent you from exposing your hands to the cold with waterproof shells, toasty insulating inserts and touch-screen-friendly liners</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> HyVent(TM) 2L shells with waterproof, breathable inserts protect hands from the elements</li>
<li> 200g Heatseeker(TM) synthetic insulation offers a great warmth-to-weight ratio, and is compressible and durable</li>
<li> Radiametric Articulation(TM) improves warmth and blood flow to your fingers by mirroring their natural relaxed curve</li>
<li> Gloves are built from the inside out with a women-specific 5-dimensional design, using measurements from a single point on the heel of the hand to ensure a consistent fit</li>
<li> X-static(R) fabric on the thumbs and index fingers of removable liners allows you to work touch-sensitive devices such as cell phones and music players</li>
<li> Gaskets around cuffs of The North Face Etip Facet gloves lock out weather and offer a secure overlap with jacket sleeves</li>
</ul>
