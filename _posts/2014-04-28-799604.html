description_list: <h4>The Hennessy Hammock Scout Classic has a diamond shape and a
  large, protective rainfly, just like the original Hennessey Hammock</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  The Scout is a simply a bit shorter in length than the original</li><li> This general-purpose
  model is an excellent and economical choice for young adventurers, Scouts and short
  individuals</li><li> Hennessey Hammock Scout provides comfort for those up to 5
  ft</li><li> 10 in</li><li> and 150 lbs</li><li>, with more room for shoulders at
  one end</li><li> Patented, easy entry through the bottom; automatically snaps shut
  behind you as weight tensions the entrance and seals with VELCRO(R) brand closure</li><li>
  Patented integral ridgeline maintains the same comfortable shape to keep your back
  straight and level when resting on the diagonal</li><li> Patented "never-tip" center
  balance design eliminates instability by entering from the center instead of flipping
  over the side</li><li> No-see-um mesh provides excellent insect protection and ventilation
  and will deflect wind, providing a calm space inside</li><li> Coated ripstop polyester
  rainfly protects the Scout from the elements; slightly asymmetric in shape, it may
  be tilted to any angle, rolled up above, removed or used separately</li><li> Nifty
  gear pocket slides on the ridgeline and stores out of sight behind your head</li><li>
  Complementary polyester webbing straps protect the tender bark of trees and provide
  greater span for the ropes</li><li> Hammock folds into an open air lounger/chair
  or can be used on the ground as a tent when paired with your hiking poles, sold
  separately</li><li> Includes detachable rainfly, support ropes and stuff sack with
  printed setup instructions</li></ul>
