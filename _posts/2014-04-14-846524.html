description_list: <h4>Innovative, lightweight and extremely breathable, the Outdoor
  Research Axiom storm-shell jacket is engineered for fast and light alpine climbs
  and all-day lapping of untracked slopes</h4><ul class="description"><li> The Axiom
  excels during highly aerobic ascent in rugged conditions; even after the 4th lap
  of your favorite backcountry stash, your jacket will still be breathing easily</li><li>
  Made with Gore-Tex(R) Active shell fabric, it provides complete waterproof protection
  while remaining highly breathable; rapid moisture transfer helps keep you dry and
  warm</li><li> The inner backer fabric is integrated directly into the membrane,
  allowing exceptional breathability and excellent next-to-skin comfort</li><li> This
  incredible breathability negates the need for pit zippers, which further saves weight
  in this streamlined and durable shell</li><li> Helmet-compatible hood shields head
  from the elements; side and back volume adjustments tailor the fit without impairing
  vision or limiting mobility</li><li> Interior stormflap behind front zipper keeps
  chilling wind out; chin guard protects sensitive skin</li><li> Low-proflile, water-resistant
  zippers protect from moisture and save on overall weight</li><li> Drawcord hem and
  rip-and-stick cuff closures seal in warmth</li><li> 2 hand pockets and a zip chest
  pocket provide quick stash options; hand pockets are set so they won't interfere
  with hip belt or climbing harness</li><li> Left hand pocket doubles as a stuff sack</li><li>
  Articulated elbows provide a natural fit and superior movement</li><li> Outdoor
  Research Axiom jacket has a trim fit that keeps jacket close while still allowing
  for athletic and dynamic movement</li></ul>
