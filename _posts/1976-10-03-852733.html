<h3>Designed for The North Face athletes competing in the Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc mountain race, the technical, close-fitting UTMB gloves provide warmth and breathability for highly aerobic activities</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Apex ClimateBlock fabric at the backs of the hands and palms does an excellent job of shedding water and blocking wind while maintaining a comfortable level of breathability</li>
<li> Fabric is ideal for running, trekking, skiing and snowshoeing in challenging, inclement weather</li>
<li> 5 Dimensional Fit(TM) uses 5 measurements of the hand to construct gloves with an accurate and consistent fit</li>
<li> Radiametric Articulation(TM) improves warmth and blood flow to your fingers by mirroring the natural relaxed curve of the hand</li>
<li> The North Face UTMB gloves have reinforcement between the thumbs and index fingers to add durability to a high-wear area</li>
</ul>
