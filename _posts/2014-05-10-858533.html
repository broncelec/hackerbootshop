description_list: <h4>As an aggressive all-mountain rider, you know you need stability
  and control when ripping down the slopes and landing big drops</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  The Burton Custom X snowboard gives you exactly what you need</li><li> The Custom
  X combines razor-sharp response and catlike edge control with featherlight weight;
  this board is supercharged with snap and stability</li><li> Snappy camber distributes
  weight evenly over the entire length of the board for smooth continuous edge control
  from tip to tail, poppy precision and powerful turning</li><li> Directional shape
  concentrates pop in the tail and offers plenty of overall float and control; twin
  flex makes riding regular or switch simple</li><li> The Channel system offers unlimited,
  on-the-fly stance adjustability and enhances board feel; compatible with EST(TM),
  Re:Flex(TM) and Disc(R) bindings</li><li> The Channel lets you fine-tune your stance
  width to the millimeter, and then dial in your toe-to-heel centering and rotate
  your angles in one fell swoop</li><li> 500 independent laminations, each individually
  oriented within the core, result in superior weight savings, strength and energized
  response</li><li> Multi-zone wood grains run perpendicular to the core adjacent
  to the Channel (where your power emanates) for ultimate strength and edge control</li><li>
  Fiberglass energy strands radiate outward from the Channels to the board's edges,
  providing driving power and effortless response</li><li> Lightweight Carbon I-Beam(TM)
  riding up the board's spine adds to board's longitudinal snap</li><li> Squeezbox
  tech transfers energy outward from under your feet, energizing the tip and tail
  for added snap when exiting a turn and ollieing</li><li> Tapered tip and tail thickness
  reduces swing weight and improves powder flotation</li><li> Edges extend out slightly
  beneath the bindings for tremendous edge hold in hard, icy conditions, but they
  remain playful and forgiving in softer conditions</li></ul>
