  soft snow, the women's SKILOGIK Goddess RL skis offer women a beautifully-crafted
  wood veneer unlike anything else on the mountain</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Rockered tips are easy to maneuver and offer excellent flotation in soft snow, and
  the relatively tight sidecut radius offers the versatility to carve groomers</li><li>
  The Goddess RL skis are sculpted from the same top-end materials as all other SKILOGIK
  skis, but scaled proportionately to cater to the performance of women skiers</li><li>
  Construction consists of a hardwood core layered in a composite of carbon and fiberglass,
  topped with an eye-pleasing wood veneer that speaks to beautiful craftsmanship</li><li>
  Complementary wood cores ensure that your left ski and right ski have a matched
  flex pattern</li><li> Black locust hardwood sidewalls offer extra grip</li><li>
  101mm waists require bindings with wide brakes</li><li> Base or topsheet color on
  the women's SKILOGIK Goddess RL skis may vary from online photo</li></ul>
