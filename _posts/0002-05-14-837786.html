<h3>The boys' REI Balaclava furnishes young faces with warmth</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> It's ideal for snow play in extreme cold that calls for more coverage than a beanie</li>
<li> Midweight polyester fabric on the top is warm, breathable and moisture-wicking, and fits nicely under a helmet; microfleece on the bottom is soft and warm against the skin</li>
<li> Face opening can be pulled down to the chin, letting a boy eat his baklava without removing his balaclava</li>
</ul>
