description_list: <h4>A high-performance full-suspension bike with nimble 27</h4><ul
  class="description"><li>5 in</li><li> wheels, the GT Sensor Elite 27</li><li>5 Bike
  blazes over trails with solid Shimano components, a RockShox fork and Fox Float
  rear shock</li><li> With 27</li><li>5 in</li><li> wheels, the GT Sensor Elite is
  quicker and lighter than 29ers but offers the same benefits of large wheels-more
  speed and better traction</li><li> Compared to 26 in</li><li> wheels, larger-diameter
  wheels roll over obstacles more easily so you won't stall going uphill over roots
  and loose soil</li><li> Lightweight 6061 hydroformed aluminum frame uses the GT
  Independent Drive design, allowing rear suspension to move independently of bottom
  bracket for a fully active rear end</li><li> Independent Drive system also smooths
  out pedaling on rough trails and minimizes suspension-induced feedback; forged linkage
  components ensure strength where it's needed</li><li> RockShox Sektor Silver TK
  suspension fork offers up a stiff 15mm thru axle, a tapered steerer and 130mm of
  travel with rebound adjustment and lockout</li><li> Fox Float CTD rear shock provides
  a plush, responsive and tunable rear end; CTD design optimizes performance with
  3 modes of travel adjustment (Climb, Trail, Descend)</li><li> Shimano Deore shifters,
  Deore Shadow Plus rear derailler and Deore front derailleur combine to supply snappy
  and precise shifts throughout the 30 gear combinations</li><li> Formula C1 hydraulic
  disc brakes provide powerful deceleration and easy speed management with 180mm rotors</li><li>
  Continental X-King tires offer excellent traction</li><li> Specs on the GT Sensor
  Elite 27</li><li>5 Bike are subject to change</li></ul>
