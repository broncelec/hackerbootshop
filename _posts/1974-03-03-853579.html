<h3>Streamlined and stylish, and with a short inseam, The North Face STH women's soft-shell pants offer near-waterproof weather protection and 4-way stretch for comfort as you carve down the mountain</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> TNF(TM) Apex ClimateBlock soft-shell fabric is windproof and highly water-resistant; seams are sealed to prevent moisture from seeping through</li>
<li> Durable Water Repellent finish causes water to bead up and roll off, fending off light rain showers and snow</li>
<li> Soft fleece lining wicks moisture and traps heat for comfort</li>
<li> Chimney Venting(TM) design uses StretchVent(TM) gaiters and zippered thigh vents with mesh gussets to vent moist air to keep you comfortable</li>
<li> Pants have a short inseam length with an active, streamlined fit; 4-way stretch ensures great freedom of movement</li>
<li> Rip-and-stick tabs on waistband adjust the fit; zippered, snap-closure fly; zip-close handwarmer pockets</li>
<li> The North Face STH soft-shell pants feature reinforced cuffs that resist abrasion from boots, boards and skis</li>
</ul>
