  SMC CR Crevasse Rescue pulley provides the mechanical advantage you need in the
  unlikely event you must haul your partner out of a crevasse</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Weighing only 52g and with a breaking strength of 22kN, the SMC CR Crevasse Rescue
  pulley is lightweight yet very strong, making it ideal for alpine climbers and mountaineers</li><li>

  prusik cord up to 8mm in diameter</li><li> Solid side plates prevent objects that
  could cause a snag from entering the pulley</li><li> SMC CR Crevasse Rescue pulley
