description_list: <h4>The Burton Social snowboard is the softest, most playful women's
  snowboard in the Burton lineup</h4><ul class="description"><li> It features a catch-free
  rocker design that can handle any feature in the park</li><li> V-Rocker-center rocker
  with additional rockers in front of your feet-ups edge control underfoot while disengaging
  tip and tail contact points for a catch-free feel</li><li> Burton designs women's
  boards to match the geometry and fitness of the female rider; True Flex improves
  stability and edge control, and energizes pop in the tip and tail</li><li> The Channel
  system offers unlimited, on-the-fly stance adjustability, enhances board feel and
  is compatible with EST(TM), Re:Flex(TM) and Disc(R) bindings</li><li> The Channel
  lets you fine-tune your stance width to the millimeter, and then dial in your toe-to-heel
  centering and rotate your angles in one fell swoop</li><li> True twin shape and
  flex are equally fun no matter which way you point it; and its dynamite pop ensures
  effortless ollieing for up-and-coming rippers</li><li> Dual-density fiberglass from
  tip to tail provides torsional forgiveness, board feel and edge hold, perfect for
  advancing to the next level</li><li> Carbon stringers radiate energy outward from
  underneath the bindings to the tip and tail for added snap and power, balancing
  the loose and playful feel of the Social snowboard</li><li> Exaggerated tip and
  tail scooping turns up the edges for a looser, more forgiving feel that adds catch-free
  fun when riding everything from a knee-high box to neck-deep pow</li><li> Edges
  extend out slightly beneath the bindings for tremendous edge hold in hard, icy conditions,
  yet they remain playful and forgiving in soft conditions</li><li> Easy-to-maintain
  extruded base enhances speed and durability to keep you moving fast in all snow
  conditions</li><li> </li></ul>
