<h3>The women's Free Thinker Bib shell pants by The North Face are built tough to withstand demanding use on big, steep mountains, offering highly breathable Gore-Tex(R) Pro protection to keep you dry</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Gore-Tex Pro 3-layer construction delivers excellent waterproof, windproof and highly breathable protection to keep you dry and comfortable, even in harsh conditions</li>
<li> Detachable bib offers waterproof protection, adjustable suspenders and a touch of stretch for comfort; use bib for added warmth and protection or remove it if it's not needed</li>
<li> Embedded RECCO(R) reflector enhances radio signals from search-and-rescue RECCO detectors, helping speed up the search for a buried avalanche victim</li>
<li> The North Face Free Thinker Bib shell pants adjust via waist tabs for a comfortable fit; zippered inner thigh vents let you dump excess heat and provide cooling ventilation</li>
<li> Internal stretch gaiters have gripper elastic and boot hooks to keep gaiters in place and prevent snow from entering legs; cuffs also have zip gussets for use over boots</li>
<li> Reinforced cuffs stand up to sharp edges and abrasion; backsides of cuffs can be hitched up via internal "Lot Lift System" to avoid uneccesary cuff wear when walking</li>
<li> Water-resistant zippers on the two hand pockets and two cargo pockets help keep contents dry</li>
<li> Clip-in tabs let you connect the bib shell pants to a compatible jacket (sold separately) for an integrated, protective barrier</li>
</ul>
