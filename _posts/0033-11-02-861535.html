<h3>A technical classic for ski mountaineering and alpine climbing, The North Face Catalyst Micro men's jacket is insulated with water-repellent, 800-fill-power goose down</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Premium 800-fill-power goose down is extremely compressible and offers exceptional warmth for its weight</li>
<li> Water-repellent down is natural down enhanced with a finish that lets the plumes stay drier longer and dry faster than untreated down</li>
<li> Slim down chambers capture and maintain warmth more efficiently than wider baffles</li>
<li> FlashDryZ panels under arms stretch, wick moisture and speed drying to enhance comfort</li>
<li> Sleek, fully adjustable, helmet-compatible hood swivels with head for a natural, unobstructed view</li>
<li> Zip handwarmer pockets are generous and easy to access</li>
<li> The North Face Catalyst Micro jacket for men stuffs into its own handwarmer pocket</li>
</ul>
