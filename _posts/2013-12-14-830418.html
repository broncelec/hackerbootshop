description_list: '<h4>Take comfort in knowing your drinking water is securely stowed
  in the sleek and clean CamelBak eddy(TM) stainless-steel water bottle</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Stainless-steel bottle is naturally BPA free, stain resistant and taste free; no
  coatings or liners are used on the interior</li><li> Redesigned cap and Big Bite
  valve provide faster flow than previous versions; just bite and sip, and your beverage
  flows through the valve</li><li> But if lifting and tipping is your preferred method,
  no problem; just remove the straw inside</li><li> Big Bite valve has an articulating
  stem, so when not in use it folds down next to the bottle and stays clean</li><li>
  Carry the integrated handle in the crook of a finger, or connect it to a pack or
  waistbelt with a small carabiner (sold separately)</li><li> Simply unscrew the cap
  to uncover bottle''s wide-mouth opening for easy filling and cleaning; opening is
  compatible with standard 63mm caps, filters and accessories</li><li> Specially shaped
  bottle fits nicely in your hand and in most automobile cup holders</li><li> CamelBak
  does not recommend the use of carbonated beverages with the straw configuration;
  remove straw and drink by tipping and sipping</li><li> Please note: CamelBak eddy
  Stainless-Steel water bottle is single walled and may get hot to the touch when
  used with hot liquids</li></ul>'
