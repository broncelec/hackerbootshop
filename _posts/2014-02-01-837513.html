  is readily available</li><li> </li><li> Suspension offers full range of motion,
  and optimal comfort for scrambling and climbing</li><li> Shoulder straps move in
  concert with your stride and reach by sliding through the bottom of the pack with
  a low-friction cable and housing</li><li> Shoulder straps are linked to together
  by the cable which helps maintain an even, balanced load across the shoulders</li><li>
  Front and back panel access to main compartment lets you get to your gear quickly
  and easily, even with skis or a snowboard attached</li><li> Dedicated avalanche
  tool pocket keeps a shovel and probe accessible</li><li> Insulated sleeve helps
