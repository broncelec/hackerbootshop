<h3>Worn and tested by REI Adventures guides, this travel-ready shirt for women has details galore to help keep you cool and comfortable in sunny climates</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Easy-care, lightweight micro-ripstop nylon wicks moisture, dries incredibly fast and delivers very good sun protection with a 40 UPF rating</li>
<li> Vent across back yoke allows easy airflow and secures with rip-and-stick tabs to keep it in place</li>
<li> Hidden zippered vents at princess seams enhance airflow from front to back; vents are strategically placed so they won't get in the way of pack straps</li>
<li> Moisture-wicking polyester mesh lines collar stand, shoulder yoke and side-seam vents</li>
<li> REI Sahara shirt has a low-profile zip security pocket next to the lower front placket</li>
</ul>
