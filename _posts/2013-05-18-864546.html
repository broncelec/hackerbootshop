description_list: <h4>Get a good night's rest after a full day on the trail with the
  Blue Kazoo Sleeping Bag from The North Face</h4><ul class="description"><li> The
  lofty 650-fill goose down will keep you warm throughout spring, summer and fall</li><li>
  With a European Norm (EN) lower-limit rating of 15degF, the Blue Kazoo is a versatile
  bag for 3-season backpacking and climbing adventures</li><li> Lofty 650-fill-power
  ProDown(TM) natural goose down insulation keeps the overall weight of the bag down
  while providing great warmth</li><li> ProDown(TM) is enhanced with a hydrophobic
  finish that improves warmth by allowing it to dry faster and repel moisture up to
  10x longer than untreated</li><li> Trapezoidal side baffles trap insulation and
  prevent it from shifting to ensure a constant baffle volume and help prevent cold
  spots</li><li> Ergonomically shaped Climashield(R) Prism synthetic insulation pads
  on the bottom create a compression-resistant, insulating buffer between you and
  the ground</li><li> Anti-compression pads made from Heatseeker(TM) Eco synthetic
  insulation are sewn into high-pressure areas that contact the ground to create an
  insulating buffer</li><li> Shaped hood and down-insulated draft collar hold in warmth</li><li>
  Insulated draft tube backs the zipper to prevent warm air from escaping; antisnag
  tape keeps the zipper from catching on the draft tube</li><li> Full-length, 2-way
  zipper lets you make adjustments for ventilation</li><li> Footbox allows natural
  foot movement while also eliminating excess lateral space so you stay warm and comfortable
  all night long</li><li> The North Face Blue Kazoo Sleeping Bag comes with a compression

  bag to your sleeping pad (sleeping pad and attachment straps not included)</li><li>
