<h3>Stay dry, stay warm and adjust to the conditions with the versatile Gilmore Triclimate 3-in-1 insulated jacket by The North Face</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> It offers confident protection for your powder-seeking adventures</li>
<li> Three different ways to wear the system: wear shell jacket and zip-in liner jacket together for maximum protection or wear either piece on its own as weather warrants</li>
<li> HyVent(TM) 2-layer construction is waterproof, windproof and breathable; fully sealed seams prevent moisture from seeping through</li>
<li> Powder skirt with gripping elastic keeps snow out; snaps let you integrate the powder skirt with compatible pants by The North Face (sold separately)</li>
<li> Zip chest media pocket; dual flap chest pockets; wrist pocket with goggles cloth; internal goggles pocket</li>
<li> Cinch adjustable hem and rip-and-stick wrist cuffs with thumbholes help seal out cold air and retain valuable warmth; underarm vents let you control airflow and your comfort</li>
<li> Fully adjustable hood ensures a weather-blocking, personalized fit; hood can be secured to jacket when not in use, preventing it from flapping around and cramping your style</li>
<li> The North Face Gilmore Triclimate zip-in/out liner jacket uses Heatseeker(TM) synthetic insulation to keep you warm without inhibiting movement</li>
<li> Liner jacket has handwarmer pockets and rib-knit collar and cuffs</li>
<li> Easy zip-in system mates the liner jacket and shell jacket together for added warmth and allows easy reach-in access to the shell's interior features</li>
</ul>
