<h3>Durably built yet lightweight, the REI Sport Beast 22 neatly separates urban attire from the gear you need for your favorite outdoor activities</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Bag zips open clamshell-style to reveal two halves, with each half covered by a zip panel; when bag is fully closed, the panels act as a center divider to separate your gear</li>
<li> The lightest rolling luggage made by REI, the Sport Beast line is made from abrasion-resistant Cordura(R) nylon; molded foam on the back provides structure</li>
<li> Rugged telescoping handle and smooth-rolling wheels make the bag easy to maneuver; cushioned grab handle makes it comfortable to lift</li>
<li> "Add-a-bag" hook near the top handle makes it easy to attach ride-along baggage and wheel your way through a crowded airport</li>
<li> Kickstand under the front of the duffel lets you park it upright</li>
<li> An interior zippered mesh pocket and 2 exterior zippered pockets provide organization</li>
<li> Exterior zippers are lock compatible (locks sold separately)</li>
<li> The REI Sport Beast 22 includes a discreet ID window accessible via an inner zip pocket</li>
<li> This item meets carry-on size restrictions for most airlines (size not to exceed 45 linear inches when adding L+W+H; this is subject to change, so check with your airline)</li>
</ul>
