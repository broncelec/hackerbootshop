<h3>The soft warmth of the REI Greenlake Fleece Hoodie is perfect for a Saturday morning at the farmer's market or relaxing at the end of a busy day</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Midweight fleece offers all-conditions warmth; it also wicks moisture and provides UPF 50+ sun protection</li>
<li> Flatlock stitching eliminates abrasion, increases comfort and enhances fit by reducing bulky seams</li>
<li> Thumbhole cuffs let you extend sleeves for more complete coverage and warmth</li>
<li> Finishing touches on the REI Greenlake Fleece Hoodie include a full-zip front, simple drawcord to adjust the hood, and wide cuffs for a comfortable fit at the wrists</li>
