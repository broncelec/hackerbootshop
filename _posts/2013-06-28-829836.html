description_list: <h4>The MSR Nook 2 offers 2 backpackers the enjoyment of an unencumbered
  outdoor experience</h4><ul class="description"><li> This 3-season tent maximizes
  living space and easily fits in backcountry campsites</li><li> Nook tent's light
  weight is easy for 2 packers to carry, and allows them to move fast; ample shoulder
  room allows both campers to sit up comfortably side by side</li><li> 1 end door
  simplifies access while saving weight; main pole and arch pole are all connected
  for fast and easy set up-even in the dark</li><li> In tight spots where staking
  out may be a challenge, the versatile MSR Nook can be set up and fully tensioned
  by using a trekking pole, not included</li><li> Attach a trekking pole across the
  foot of the tent on the outside with the included pole adaptor; this fully tensions

  webbing, and poles make set up easy and intuitive</li><li> Clip construction ensures

  rainfly material with a DuraShield(TM) coating provides an exceptionally weatherproof
  layer at minimal weight</li><li> 40-denier nylon floor material resists tears, cuts
