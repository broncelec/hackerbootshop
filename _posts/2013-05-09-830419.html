  CamelBak eddy(TM) Insulated Stainless-Steel water bottle</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Micro-welded, double-wall bottle features vacuum insulation to keep your drink cool
  all afternoon</li><li> Stainless-steel bottle is naturally BPA free, stain resistant
  and taste free; no coatings or liners are used on the interior</li><li> Redesigned
  cap and Big Bite valve provide faster flow than previous versions; just bite and
  sip and your beverage flows through the valve</li><li> But if lifting and tipping
  is your preferred method, no problem; just remove the straw inside</li><li> Big
  Bite valve has an articulating stem, so when not in use it folds down next to the
  bottle and stays clean</li><li> Carry the integrated handle in the crook of a finger,
  or connect it to a pack or waistbelt with a small carabiner (sold separately)</li><li>
  Simply unscrew the cap to uncover bottle's wide-mouth opening for easy filling and
  cleaning; opening is compatible with standard 63mm caps, filters and accessories</li><li>
  CamelBak eddy Insulated Stainless-Steel water bottle is shaped to fit nicely in
  your hand and in most automobile cup holders</li><li> CamelBak does not recommend
  the use of carbonated beverages with the straw configuration; remove straw and drink
  by tipping and sipping</li></ul>
