description_list: <h4>Sockwell Circulator Compression socks for men offer moderate
  graduated leg compression</h4><ul class="description"><li> Compression socks increase
  blood flow/energy, decrease swelling and deliver firm muscle support</li><li> Gradient
  compression is greatest at the ankles and gradually decreases toward the tops of
  the socks; blood pushes upward toward your heart, maximizing circulation</li><li>
  Moderate (15 - 20 mmHg) compression is recommended for all day and everyday wear,
  prolonged sitting or standing, travel, exercise and recovery and minor to moderate
  swelling</li><li> Fiber blend balances the durability and thermoregulation properties
  of wool with naturally antimicrobial and luxurious bamboo</li><li> Spandex used
  throughout the entire sock ensures a snug fit all day long and helps prevent slipping
  in the shoe</li><li> Turn welt tops help keep the socks up and gives if you want
  a clean, finished appearance to the top of the sock</li><li> Seam-free toe closures
  ensure that you don't even notice they are there</li><li> Spandex bands knitted
  into the arch areas of the Sockwell Circulator Compression socks provide support
  to the arches and reduce sock slippage on the foot</li><li> Y-heel construction
  contours the heels more exactly to the foot and helps reduce the incidence of the
  sock slippage into the shoe</li><li> *Discount will be applied when you check out</li><li>
