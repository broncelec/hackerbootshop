<h3>The REI Sub Kilo +20 sleeping bag doesn't compromise warmth or durability-it's great for camping, backpacking and ultralight adventures</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Sleeping bag features premium 750-fill-power goose down insulation, a downproof polyester ripstop shell and a soft polyester taffeta lining</li>
<li> Vertical Baffle construction allows the goose down to remain fully lofted and keeps it from shifting and migrating, preventing cold spots</li>
<li> Contoured hood, roomy footbox, full-length locking zipper, full-length draft tube and muffler all keep body heat in and cold air out</li>
<li> Internal pocket keeps all your essentials-headlamp, watch, glasses-right at hand and easy to find in the dark</li>
<li> Differentiated drawcords (1 round, 1 flat) let you adjust hood and neck easily in the dark</li>
<li> Pad loops provide attachment points to keep your sleeping bag and pad together to avoid rolling off onto the cold ground (straps not included)</li>
<li> Efficient, slim cut keeps the weight down</li>
<li> Comes with stuff sack and large cotton storage bag</li>
<li> Right-hand zip</li>
<li> Special buy</li>
</ul>
