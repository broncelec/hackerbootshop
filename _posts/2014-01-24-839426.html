description_list: <h4>The lightweight Dynafit One U-TF randonee boots balance a progressive
  flex with great walkability so you can ski those steep backcountry lines you've
  always dreamed about</h4><ul class="description"><li> Polyurethane shells and cuffs
  offer similar performance to the popular TLT5 Mountain boots, but are a touch wider
  in the forefoot for a more comfortable fit</li><li> Expanded polyurethane insulation
  layer is glued to the insides of the shells to help keep your feet warm on frigid
  winter days</li><li> Compact shells with rockered soles provide excellent walkability
  and nimbleness when you're booting up steep snow slopes or scrambling rocky ridges</li><li>
  Lightweight liners are premolded on anatomic lasts for use right out of the box;
  or, have the liners custom molded to your feet by a qualified ski shop employee</li><li>
  Opening the Ultra-Lock magnesium cuff buckles simultaneously changes the boots from
  ski to walk mode for fast, effortless transitions</li><li> Central magnesium buckles
  are positioned exactly on the shell pivot points to keep your heels in place when
  you're skinning uphill and skiing back down</li><li> Cuff and central buckles are
  designed with a retention system to prevent unwanted release</li><li> Ski/walk mechanisms
  can be set between 15deg and 18deg of forward lean, as well as loosened for walking</li><li>
  Flexible tongue design doesn't interfere with the cuff rotation for comfort when
  touring</li><li> Power straps help close the boots securely around your legs</li><li>
  Dynafit One U-TF randonee boots have self-guiding notches located at the inserts
  at the toes of the boots to ease stepping into Dynafit bindings</li></ul>
