description_list: <h4>Incorporating features from the rugged Axl, but designed for
  the resort rather than backcountry, the TwentyTwo Designs Vice telemark bindings
  provide three pivot positions to match your skiing style</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Adjust the feel of the bindings by selecting one of three cable guide positions;
  move the pin forward for a more neutral feel and back for a more active feel</li><li>
  The Vice bindings do not have a free-pivot touring function, making them ideal for
  your hard-charging, lift-served days at the ski resort</li><li> Cables and springs
  are routed underfoot to allow telemark boots to flex naturally at the bellows; springs
  provide more than 2 in</li><li> of travel</li><li> 2,000-lb</li><li> test cable
  and solid steel toe pieces withstand hard use in the mountains</li><li> Size Small
  TwentyTwo Designs Vice telemark binding fit boots Mondo size 25</li><li>5 and under;
  size Large fits Mondo 26 and up</li></ul>
