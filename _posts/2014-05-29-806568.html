description_list: <h4>The Rossignol FKS 180 XXL alpine ski bindings are designed to
  enhance your performance, increase your safety and create an unparalleled connection
  with your skis</h4><ul class="description"><li> Why settle for less?</li><li> Remember
  last year when you hit a small bump, your ski randomly popped off, and you went
  down like a freight train?</li><li> To prevent such mishaps, Rossingnol has engineered
  key features into the binding to reduce premature release, the most innovative of
  which is a rotating heel piece</li><li> Turntable heel rotates with the boot directly
  under your tibia, creating consistent and reliable release</li><li> FKS also features
  elastic travel at the toe and heel which absorbs shock and allows a lower setting
  of release values</li><li> Rossignol has reduced the space between heelpiece and
  toepiece mounting points; the result is increased responsiveness</li><li> 7 contact
  points between the bindings and the boots ensure effective power transfer</li><li>
  Antifriction device increases leverage and control, especially on wide skis</li><li>
  Rossignol FKS 180 XXL bindings come with 115mm brakes that fit most all-mountain
  wide skis and some powder skis</li></ul>
