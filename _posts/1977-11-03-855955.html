<h3>Lightweight and packable, The North Face Aconcagua jacket layers toddler girls in a downy soft, warm, wind- and water-resistant weather barrier while they enjoy their cold-weather adventures</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Insulated with 550-fill-power down for an unsurpassed warmth-to-weight ratio; down is the lightest, warmest and most compressible insulation known</li>
<li> Downproof, quick-drying, wind-resistant nylon shell breathes well and is treated for water resistance</li>
<li> Zippered handwarmer pockets warm up chilly fingers quickly</li>
<li> Stand-up collar has velvety soft lining for added warmth; reinforced windflap behind zipper protects against cold air penetration and zipper snags</li>
</ul>
