description_list: <h4>The Petzl Pirana descender is effective for single or double
  rope canyoning descents and can be installed on the rope without removing it from
  the harness</h4><ul class="description"><li> Pirana offers 3 different braking positions,
  according to the weight of the user, the rope diameter and the terrain</li><li>
  It also offers 2 points where the rope can be angled to adjust the descent speed</li><li>
  A plastic attachment ensures perfect support for many types of HMS locking carabiners</li><li>
  Carabiners with cross sections of 12mm (e</li><li>g</li><li> Petzl Attache) will
  provide a very tight fit in the small hole, so tight that it takes a bit of pressure
  to get the carabiner in</li><li> Snug fit creates a rigid carabiner/descender unit
  that helps to reduce risk of loading carabiner across the gate; also stays securely
  attached to harness to help prevent loss</li><li> Designed for use with the ''Rapid''
  technique, which foils formation of a lark's head hitch around Pirana body and reduces
  kinks without curbing friction</li><li> May be used with double ropes, but not all
  braking positions may be usable depending on the ropes' diameter</li><li> The Pirana
  can also be used to belay the leader</li></ul>
