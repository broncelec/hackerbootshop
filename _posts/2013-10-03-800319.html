  of visible glare from water, snow, sand and pavement for increased visual acuity
  and decreased eye strain</li><li> Each frame includes 1 set of polarized lenses
  (tint depends on frame color) and 2 additional sets of lenses for a total of 3 sets
  of lenses</li><li> Brown frames feature polarized brown lenses that block reflected
  glare while providing increased depth perception and reducing eye strain</li><li>
  Black frames feature polarized gray lenses that block reflected glare while preserving
  natural colors in order to provide true color definition</li><li> Non-polarized,
  additional lenses are ideal for low and medium to nighttime light</li><li> Scratch-
  and impact-resistant Carbonic(TM) lenses use Tapered Lens Technology from Smith(TM)
  to provide distortion-free vision</li><li> Tapered Lens Technology contours the

  see is what you get</li><li> Grilamid(R) TR90 lightweight nylon frames offer a consistent
  fit and flexibility in all temperatures and are extremely impact resistant</li><li>

  number the more curved the lens-Smith features sunglasses with 6, 7, 8 and 9 base
  curvature)</li><li> Frames have a medium fit with large coverage</li></ul>
