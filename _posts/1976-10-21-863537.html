<h3>The North Face Warm Crew Neck top for women features a polyester blend fabric that moves moisture away from your skin and dries quickly for prolonged comfort in the outdoors</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Midweight moisture-wicking polyester and polyolefin fabric features FlashDry(TM) microparticles embedded in the fabric to dramatically improve dry time and breathability</li>
<li> Made of crushed coconut shells and crushed volcanic rock, the FlashDry fabric additive leads to faster dry times and will not wash out</li>
<li> You'll move without restriction thanks to the stretchy fabric and flat seams, which are designed to enhance motion; next-to-skin fit</li>
<li> Closeout</li>
</ul>
