description_list: <h4>Built for freeriders, the Burton Barracuda snowboard features
  a special rockered tip for enhanced board float on deep snow days, whether dropping
  pillow lines or traversing across the mountain</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  S-Rocker(TM) applies a unique contour to the Barracuda; entry rocker extends from
  the nose to under your front foot, and then transitions to camber between the feet</li><li>
  Slightly tapered shape and directional flex combine with S-Rocker to create a floater
  that goes up, over and through anything</li><li> Compressing the camber causes the
  entry rocker to naturally lift the nose, improving float while maintaining speed
  through deep-driving pow turns and variable conditions</li><li> Nug Raduction optimizes
  every element of the board, from flex profile to sidecut, letting you downsize up
  to 10cm from your normal board length</li><li> Nug Raduction boards ride the same
  as a traditional length board, but offer a surprisingly stable and responsive ride;
  Burton recommends sizing Barracuda down 2 - 3cm</li><li> The Channel system offers
  unlimited, on-the-fly stance adjustability, enhances board feel and is compatible
  with EST(TM), Re:Flex(TM) and Disc(R) bindings</li><li> The Channel lets you fine-tune
  your stance width to the millimeter, and then dial in your toe-to-heel centering
  and rotate your angles in one fell swoop</li><li> Wood core is snappy, powerful
  and durable; dual-zone wood grains, positioned along the toe and heel edges perpendicular
  to the core, enhance edge hold and add strength</li><li> Fiberglass in the topsheet
  provides versatile flex and response so you can shred your big mountain descents</li><li>
  Lightweight Carbon I-Beam(TM) riding up the board's spine adds to board's longitudinal
  snap</li><li> Tapered thickness in tip and tail reduces swing weight and improves
  powder flotation</li><li> Edges extend out slightly beneath the bindings for tremendous
  edge hold in hard, icy conditions, but they remain playful and forgiving in softer
  conditions</li></ul>
