description_list: '<h4>NEMO doesn''t think we all sleep like mummies! The Harmony
  25 women''s sleeping bag finds a middle ground for the living and breaks the mold
  of sleeping bag shapes</h4><ul class="description"><li> The new NEMO Spoon Shape
  is wide in the shoulders, tapers to hips and then gently flares back out to allow
  room for the natural bend and shift of knees</li><li> PrimaLoft(R) Synergy synthetic
  microfiber insulation works a lot like down: it minimizes bulkiness, packs down
  well and stays warm even when wet</li><li> Underside of sleeping bag features 10%
  less insulation than the topside to cut down on weight; insulation underneath is
  often flattened, thus less doesn''t hinder performance</li><li> Waterproof/breathable
  coating on backside of fabric combined with a Durable Water Repellent on the exterior
  protects from tent wall condensation</li><li> A nifty little feature in the hood
  is the tuckable Blanket Fold(TM), an insulated flap of fabric that can be wrapped
  around neck to block drafts and add a layer of warmth</li><li> NEMO Harmony 25 women''s
  sleeping bag comes with a compression stuff sack and storage bag</li></ul>'
