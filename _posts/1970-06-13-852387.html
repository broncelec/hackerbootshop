<h3>The North Face RDT shirt is an ideal layer to have next to your skin while hiking</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> This lightweight stretch knit has FlashDry(TM) fibers to help keep you dry when you start to work up a sweat</li>
<li> Made of crushed coconut shells and crushed volcanic rock, FlashDry fibers dramatically improve the fabric's dry time and breathability, help control odors and won't wash out</li>
<li> Recycled polyester wicks away sweat and stretches with you</li>
<li> Fabric provides UPF 50+ sun protection, shielding skin from harmful ultraviolet rays</li>
<li> Flatlock seams on The North Face RDT shirt reduce chafing and increase durability</li>
</ul>
