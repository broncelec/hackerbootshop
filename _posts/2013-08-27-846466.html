  prolonged sitting or standing, travel, exercise and recovery and minor to moderate
  swelling</li><li> Fiber blend balances the durability and thermoregulation properties
  of wool with naturally antimicrobial and luxurious bamboo</li><li> Spandex used
  throughout the entire sock ensures a snug fit all day long and helps prevent slipping
  in the shoe</li><li> Turn welt tops help keep the socks up and give a clean, finished
  appearance to the top of the sock</li><li> Seam-free toe closures minimize friction
  and reduce irritation</li><li> Y-heel construction contours the heels more exactly
  to the foot</li><li> Spandex bands knitted into the arch areas of the Sockwell On
