description_list: '<h4>The lofty 800-fill-power Sierra Designs Backcountry Bed 800
  3-Season Sleeping Bag has an integrated comforter and zero zippers for a unique
  outdoor sleeping experience through spring, summer and fall</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Climb into the bag via the large oval opening on top; the oversize comforter seals
  up the opening so you can sleep comfortably no matter your position: back, side
  or stomach</li><li> With a European Norm (EN) lower-limit rating of 20degF, the
  Backcountry Bed 800 3-Season sleeping bag is suitable for spring, summer and fall
  backpacking</li><li> On warmer nights, flip the comforter outside the sleeping bag
  and tuck it back for ventilation; insulated hand/arm pockets provide warmth when
  the comforter is outside the bag</li><li> Down is considered the best insulation
  available but when wet, it quickly loses loft and the ability to keep you warm;
  800-fill-power DriDown is treated to resist moisture</li><li> Proprietary process
  treats each individual duck down plume with a molecular-level polymer so the down
  stays dry longer, lofts better and dries faster than untreated down</li><li> DriDown
  insulation stays dry 10 times longer, retains 170% more loft when exposed to moisture
  and dries 33% faster than untreated down</li><li> Premium 800-fill-power duck down
  is extremely compressible and offers exceptional warmth for its weight</li><li>
  Ripstop polyester exterior endures frequent use in the outdoors; polyester taffeta
  lining is soft and comfortable next to skin</li><li> Sleeping pad sleeve on the
  bottom of the bag secures your pad (pad sold separately) to create the experience
  of a fully integrated bed</li><li> Sierra Designs Backcountry Bed 800 3-Season Sleeping
  Bag comes with a stuff sack and storage sack</li><li> European Norm (EN) is an independent
  third-party temperature rating, allowing accurate comparisons across brands with
  other EN-rated bags</li></ul>'
