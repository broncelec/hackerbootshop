description_list: <h4>Take on strenuous climbs and challenging descents in the backcountry
  with the Scarpa Gea randonee boots</h4><ul class="description"><li> Lightweight
  yet performance-oriented, the Gea boots have the fit and features you need</li><li>
  Feature Pebax Rnew(R) plastic that is made from castor plant oil rather than petroleum
  as most plastics are</li><li> Pebax Rnew peforms exceptionally well across a wide
  range of temperatures, ensuring consistent flex, strength and stability</li><li>
  Shell design combines the best of both the overlap and cabrio constructions to allow
  easy entry/exit, excellent volume control and strong support for downhill performance</li><li>
  Touring-style Intuition Pro Flex G liners use 100% Ultralon(R) foam for a custom
  fit; liners offer good range of motion yet provide support with stiff tongues</li><li>
  Tongue-style liners (as opposed to a wrap-style liners) provide easy entry and comfortable
  flex through the shins when touring</li><li> See an REI ski shop professional to
  have the liners custom molded to your feet to maximize comfort and performance</li><li>
  Boots are compatible with all randonee bindings; tech fittings at the toes accept
  Dynafit-style bindings</li><li> Tech fittings have grooves that make getting into
  Dynafit-style bindings easy; fitting indicators can be seen from above to help you
  line the boot toes up with the bindings</li><li> 3 magnesium buckles and an instep
  strap on each boot lock your feet in place; instep straps are easy to engage with
  gloves on</li><li> Buckle clasps keep the buckles in place for rapid transitions
  between uphill and downhill</li><li> Wide rip-and-stick power straps wrap securely
  around the outside of the cuffs, distributing pressure and bringing the cuffs as
  close as possible your lower legs</li><li> Rear ski/walk mechanisms free the cuffs
  for walking comfort; flip the switches to ski mode and you can lock the cuffs at
  16deg or 20deg of forward lean</li></ul>
