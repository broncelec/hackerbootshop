description_list: <h4>Designed in a women-specific last, the women's Scarpa Freedom
  SL randonee boots mix stiff progressive flex, light weight and a vast cuff motion
  for best-in-class all-mountain performance</h4><ul class="description"><li> Boots
  feature lightweight Pebax(R) Rnew plastic that is made from castor plant oil rather
  than petroleum as most plastics are</li><li> Pebax Rnew performs exceptionally well
  across a wide range of temperatures, ensuring consistent flex, strength and stability</li><li>
  Weighing in at only 3,040g (6 lbs</li><li> 11 oz) per pair for a size mondo 25,
  the Freedom SL boots are remarkably light among the freeride boot category</li><li>
  Boots employ Scarpa's patented Carbon Core Technology, which molds the lower boot
  around a carbon fiber frame to stiffen the boot without adding cumbersome weight</li><li>
  27deg of cuff range allows for efficient walking and touring; two-part design allows
  7deg resistance-free back flex and 20deg of forward flex</li><li> Overlap closure
  with two upper cuff buckles and two lower cuff buckles, and a low-profile 101mm
  forefoot last contribute great power transfer</li><li> Intuition FR Speed liners
  put resilient, lightweight and warm custom moldable foam into a mutlidensity alpine-style
  liner that matches the power and tourability of the boot</li><li> Forward lean is
  14deg, with plus or minus 4deg of adjustability</li><li> Vibram(R) injected rubber
  outsoles provide good grip when you're walking</li><li> Vibram Mountain Plus soles
  are compatible with all randonee bindings, including Dynafit-style tech bindings</li><li>
  Scarpa Freedoom SL randonee boots for women include adjustable spoilers and oversized
  power straps</li></ul>
