<h3>Textured for increased comfort and absorption, the small-size REI MultiTowel is soft and quick drying</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Measuring only 14 x 10 in</li>
<li>, the towel is easy to take along on trips into the mountains</li>
<li> Waffle texture allows the towel to absorb up to 8 times its weight in water, yet wring out almost completely dry</li>
<li> Ultrasoft synthetic fabric is light and compact, taking up very little space in your backpack or bag</li>
<li> Quick-attach loop makes it easy to hang the towel to dry</li>
<li> The REI MultiTowel comes in a small carry pouch</li>
</ul>
