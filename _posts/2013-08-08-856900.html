description_list: <h4>Built for the park, the Flow Isis-SE snowboard bindings deliver
  a great foot-to-board connection and feel thanks to the forgiving nylon baseplates
  and cushioned BankBeds</h4><ul class="description"><li> Rockered nylon baseplates
  feature 2</li><li>5deg Canted BankBeds for response, support and a natural feel
  when strapped in</li><li> Modback highbacks feature separated upper flexible zones
  and lower nylon heel cup zones; upper zone uses independently adjustable support
  panels for fine-tuned performance</li><li> New Active Strap Technology (N</li><li>A</li><li>S</li><li>T</li><li>Y)
  straps automatically lift up when you open the reclining highbacks and actively
  tighten when you close the highback</li><li> N</li><li>A</li><li>S</li><li>T</li><li>Y
  straps reduce friction and create more room for easy in and out of bindings-using
  Flow bindings is now even easier</li><li> Power Triangle design links the highbacks
  directly to the center area of the baseplates with a high-tensile steel cable, increasing
  control and power transfer</li><li> Active HYBRID PowerCapStrap bridges the gap
  between traditional bindings and Flow SpeedEntry straps; bindings feature 3D-shaped
  ankle straps that diagonally cover the foot</li><li> Ankle straps connect to toe
  straps for pressure distribution and energy transfer, and offer perfect boot positioning</li><li>
  LockingSlapRatchet (LSR) buckles offer dual entry into bindings, either SpeedEntry
  or SideEntry-just slap them to open or lock them down to shred</li><li> Bindings
  are compatible with Burton The Channel snowboards and include disc kit</li></ul>
