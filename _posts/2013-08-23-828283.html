  class="description"><li> The Kuhl Liberator convertible pants let you adapt to changing
  conditions and stay comfortable</li><li> Recognizing this 2012 Editors' Choice Award
  winner, the April issue of BACKPACKER says, "The Liberator has a trim, mountain-town
  style that slyly masks the two-in-one design</li><li>"</li><li> Pants convert quickly
  and easily to shorts with leg zippers; zippers won't snag and are hidden from view
  for a great look</li><li> Fabric blend places cotton on the outside and nylon next
  to skin; soft cotton pulls moisture away from the nylon, bringing it to the surface
  where it can evaporate</li><li> Liberator pants feature Kuhl Rhino Technology, which
  places rugged exterior fabrics on top of soft, stretchy fabric for excellent durability
  and freedom of movement</li><li> Rhino Technology is used in high-mobility areas,
  such as the back waistband and the knees</li><li> Standard 5-pocket design combines
  with 2 zippered thigh pockets, a welt pocket on the left side and a 3D cell phone
  pocket on the right side to stow all your essentials</li><li> The Kuhl Liberator
  convertible pants have a gusseted crotch and articulated knees that facilitate freedom
  of movement for increased comfort</li></ul>
