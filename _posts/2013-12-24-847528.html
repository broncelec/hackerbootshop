description_list: <h4>The women's Eleanor 19degF sleeping bag features the new Sierra
  Designs DriDown(TM) finish for down insulation</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  It resists water and dries fast! Regular down takes on water and is very difficult
  to dry; DriDown proprietary process treats each individual duck down plume with
  a hydrophobic finish</li><li> With the duck down now resistant to water, the insulation
  maintains its loft and stays dry 7 times longer than untreated down</li><li> It
  also performs better in high humidity than regular down and, in case it accidentally
  gets wet, it will dry out faster, too</li><li> Women-specific bags are cut to match
  a woman's shape, and provide extra insulation and warmth in the hood and feet areas</li><li>
  Lightweight yet durable 30-denier micro-ripstop polyester shell and comfortable,
  moisture-wicking polyester lining warm up fast</li><li> Baffle construction keeps
  down from migrating, eliminating cold spots</li><li> Full-length 2-way, double sliding
  zipper allows easy venting; locking slider is backed by wide, antisnag binding tape</li><li>
  Snag-free zipper tracks prevent the dreaded stuck zipper by creating a barrier between
  the lining and the zipper track</li><li> Fully insulated draft tube backing the
  zipper keeps body heat in and cold air out</li><li> Ergonomic, nonrestrictive hood
  cradles your head in warmth; hood features differentiated drawcords that make fit
  adjustments easy, even in the dark</li><li> Roomy, ergonomically shaped footbox
  enhances comfort and warmth of feet</li><li> Sierra Designs Eleanor 19degF comes
  with stuff sack and storage bag</li><li> European Norm (EN) is an independent third-party
  temperature rating, allowing accurate comparisons across brands with other EN-rated
  bags</li></ul>
