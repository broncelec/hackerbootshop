description_list: '<h4>This ultralight, multi-purpose rope grab is an ideal back-up
  for standard ascenders or for those who wish to travel as light as possible</h4><ul
  class="description"><li> Much lighter and more compact than standard ascenders,
  plus faster to set up than prusik knots and works well in pulley systems</li><li>
  Tibloc should be used only with carabiners made of uniform oval or round stock in
  order to prevent damage to the rope</li><li> Caution: hot-forged carabiners with
  T-shaped stock, such as the Petzl Spirit, should NOT be used</li><li> The Tibloc
  is an amazing little tool when used properly, but can easily be misused; it is essential
  to read the instructions to prevent rope damage!</li></ul>'
