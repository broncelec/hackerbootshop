<h3>Soft and sleek, The North Face Shiso gloves keep your hands warm when you're running errands or out walking the dog</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Soft polyester silken fleece is very warm yet low profile so you'll have good dexterity while wearing these gloves</li>
<li> Women-specific 5 Dimensional Fit(TM) uses 5 measurements of the hand to construct gloves with an accurate and consistent fit</li>
<li> Articulation improves warmth and blood flow by mirroring the natural relaxed curve of your fingers</li>
<li> The North Face Shiso gloves have synthetic gripper material on the palms and elastic at the wrists</li>
</ul>
