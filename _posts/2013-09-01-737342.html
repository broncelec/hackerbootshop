  of places more securely</li><li> Independently driven by patent-pending compression
  drive springs for increased holding force in tough placements</li><li> Huge cam
  stops prevent over-rotation and offer ample passive umbrella strength like the double-axle
  models</li><li> Easy-to-place ribbed trigger and thumb rest improve handling when
  arms are pumped</li><li> C3 cam's stem design is ID-colored and offers superb flexibility

  and making cam units inherently stronger</li><li> Color-coded nylon slings coincide
  with stem for easy identification</li></ul>
