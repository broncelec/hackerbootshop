<h3>Stay dry during a sudden shower with the North Face Venture Rain pants for women; lightweight and compact material makes for easy stowing in a pack and when that shower hits you'll be totally ready</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> The Venture rain pants are a staple that every outdoor enthusiast will appreciate</li>
<li> HyVent(R) 2</li>
<li>5-layer fabric provides waterproof, highly breathable protection; a tri-component, multi-layer inner coating channels moisture outward away from body</li>
<li> HyVent is lightweight and packable, moves easily over layers and is more breathable than unlined, treated fabrics</li>
<li> All seams are sealed for complete protection</li>
<li> Personalize the fit with the elastic drawcord waist</li>
<li> 2 zip hand pockets; Venture pants roll up small and stow inside 1 hand pocket for easy transport</li>
</ul>
