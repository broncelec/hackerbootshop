description_list: <h4>Zip over the lip and leave it all behind on the women's Atomic
  Elysian skis</h4><ul class="description"><li> They charge into ungroomed snow with
  predicable stability thanks to their mid-wide 95mm waists and slightly rockered
  tips</li><li> 95mm waists and lightweight design float in powder and turn with ease
  over variable snow</li><li> When skis are weighted, there is a slight rise in the
  tips that makes it easy to initiate turns</li><li> When skis are put on edge after
  starting a turn, the camber flattens out to deliver full-length contact with snow
  and excellent edge hold</li><li> Wood core provides smooth handling at high speeds
  and in deep powder; carbon "backbone" insert enhances edge grip and reduces vibrations
  for excellent stability</li><li> Sidewall construction ensures maximum torsional
  rigidity, uncanny edge grip and controlled tip-to-tail flex; sidewall is reinforced
  in binding area with 3 layers of material</li><li> Half cap construction in tip
  and tail reduces swing weight and chipping when your skis bang together</li><li>
  Atomic Elysian skis feature 95mm waists that require bindings with wide brakes</li><li>
  Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
