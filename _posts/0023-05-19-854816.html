description_list: '<h4>Working up a sweat in cold weather? Wearing a warm, wicking
  base layer like the REI Midweight Polartec(R) Power Dry(R) crew can make the difference
  between days to remember and those to forget</h4><ul class="description"><li> Polartec
  Power Dry uses 2 different yarns on either side of the fabric to enhance comfort:
  interior yarn wicks moisture, and exterior yarn dries quickly</li><li> Combination
  of the 2 yarns helps keep you dry during highly aerobic activities because it moves
  moisture away from skin faster than single-component fabrics such as cotton</li><li>
  Fabric offers UPF rating of 30 to protect against harmful UV light</li><li> Flatseam
  construction is soft and non-chafing next to skin, and raglan seams are designed
  to be comfortable when wearing pack straps on your shoulders</li><li> Underarm and
  side gussets promote freedom of motion and reduce chafing under a hipbelt</li><li>
  Longer length helps top stay tucked in, and smooth texture of outer surface helps
  it slide easily under extra layers</li><li> The men''s REI Midweight Polartec Power
  Dry crew features a next-to-skin fit that hugs the body</li></ul>'
