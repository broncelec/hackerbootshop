description_list: <h4>The BioLite Wood Burning CampStove(TM) combines the benefits
  of a backpacking stove and an off-grid power charger so you can cook a meal while
  charging your gadgets at a backcountry campsite</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  There's no need to buy or carry heavy fuel canisters with this stove-simply collect
  twigs during your journey and burn them when you get to camp</li><li> Using patent-pending
  thermoelectric technology, the stove converts heat to electricity that charges an
  internal battery and powers a fan to increase the efficiency of the fire</li><li>
  Extra electricity can be used to charge small electronics like cell phones, headlamps
  and rechargeable batteries via the USB port; devices and charging cables sold separately</li><li>
  For an Apple iPhone(R) 4S, 20 min</li><li> of charging with a strong fire gives
  you about 60 min</li><li> of talk time; charging times vary by device as well as
  by the strength of the fire</li><li> During a full burn, the CampStove can boil
  1 liter of water in as little as 4 min</li><li> 30 sec</li><li>; place your pot
  or pan on the built-in pot support</li><li> Like a campfire, you can sit around
  the CampStove and watch the flames dance while you roast marshmallows and spend
  time with friends</li><li> Twigs from hardwood trees, like oak, maple and hickory,
  will burn hottest and cleanest; choose wood that's dry, and avoid burning leaves,
  as they can be smoky</li><li> CampStove can also burn wood pellets (available at
  many home and garden stores) if you're camping in a spot where you're not allowed
  to collect twigs or trees aren't present</li><li> BioLite CampStove weighs about
  2 lbs</li><li>and is about the same size as a 1-liter Nalgene water bottle; power
  module stows inside the fuel chamber when the stove is not in use</li><li> Anodized-aluminum
  legs create a stable platform for cooking; legs fold in for compact storage when
  you're done making dinner</li><li> CampStove's starter battery helps kick-start
  the fire before the stove begins generating its own power so it's best to charge
  the battery for 2 - 4 hrs</li></ul>
