description_list: <h4>With a 102mm waist to bust through crud and bidirectional sidecut
  you can ski forward or reverse, the K2 Shreditor 102 skis offer a well-rounded freestyle
  platform for any terrain on the mountain</h4><ul class="description"><li> With a
  tip that's just slightly wider than the tail, the bidirectional sidecut makes it
  easy to ski and land jumps backward so you can jib all you want off natural features</li><li>
  Raised tips and tails float in soft snow, pop when doing tricks and deliver agile
  performance on all kinds of terrain; camber underfoot grips hardpack</li><li> Lightweight
  aspen and paulownia wood core produces a natural flex, allowing the ski to achieve
  full contact with the snow throughout the turn</li><li> A fiberglass weave around
  the wood core provides torsional stiffness for highly responsive turning</li><li>
  The widest point of the tips is placed further back than on other K2 skis to reduce
  the tendency of skis to hook in light crust and throw you off balance</li><li> Use
  tip and tail holes to attach skins (sold separately); remove plugs with a flathead
  screwdriver</li><li> 102mm waist requires bindings with wide brakes</li><li> Base
  or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
