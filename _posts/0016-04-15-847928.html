<h3>The women's REI Traverse Shocklight trekking poles provide quiet stability and support so you hear the sounds of nature and not the clicks of your poles</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Women-specific design is lighter weight and shorter, and features a smaller grip than its unisex counterpart</li>
<li> Shock-absorbing poles reduce fatigue while improving stability; lockout mechanism creates a rigid pole when needed for more efficient climbing</li>
<li> Shocklight shock absorbers weigh less than common spring-loaded mechanisms and won't rattle within the shaft as you walk</li>
<li> Internal twist-lock mechanisms apply a wide area of pressure against pole walls to lock in length adjustment</li>
<li> With the Stop Lock system, poles won't come apart; system makes the pole sections into 1 unit for security and stability</li>
<li> Twist-locking pole sections let you tailor the length to fit your terrain: make them shorter for the way up, longer for the way down</li>
<li> Strong 7075-T6 aluminum 3-section telescoping poles extend to a maximum length of 49</li>
<li>2 in</li>
<li> and compact to 26 in</li>
<li> for easy storage and transport</li>
<li> Soft EVA foam hand grips are sized for a woman's hands and have an ergonomic, contoured shape that is easy to hold; adjustable padded neoprene wrist straps add support</li>
<li> Fitted with trekking discs and extra-durable tungsten carbide tips; included tip protectors are strictly for travel/packing protection, not intended for hiking</li>
</ul>
