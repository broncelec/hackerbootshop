<h3>The North Face ThermoBall(TM) men's jacket puts revolutionary new ThermoBall(TM) synthetic insulation to work</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Warm and light, it mimics the best of down, yet still insulates even when wet</li>
<li> Functioning like down feathers, the tiny round clusters of ThermoBall spun polyester trap warm air, while softly conforming to your body's shape</li>
<li> ThermoBall retains 80% of its insulating power even when dampened by rain, humidity or sweat, so you'll continue to stay warm</li>
<li> Small baffles in shell fabric allow insulation to fully expand to retain body heat; highly compressible ThermoBall insulation offers warmth equal to 600-fill-power goose down</li>
<li> Tightly-woven nylon shell features square stitching that helps hold insulation in place to keep it evenly distributed; Durable Water Repellent finish repels light moisture</li>
<li> Nylon lining wicks sweat off the skin for quick evaporation, helping you stay dry and comfortable</li>
<li> Quickly stuff the jacket into its own space-saving, left-hand stow pocket for compact storage</li>
<li> Zippered hand pockets; full-length front zipper with internal windflap; stretch-bound cuffs, low-profile drawcord hem</li>
<li> The North Face ThermoBall jacket has a standard fit and is machine washable</li>
<li> ThermoBall jackets were thoroughly tested by The North Face athletes, including Conrad Anker and Jimmy Chin, during summit trips on Denali and Mount Meru</li>
</ul>
