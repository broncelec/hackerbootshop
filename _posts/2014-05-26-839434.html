description_list: <h4>The Rossignol Vita Sensor2 70 ski boots will take you from tentative
  turns to confident shredding</h4><ul class="description"><li> Shell of the Vita
  Sensor2 70 is designed to enhance balance through direct contact with your big toe,
  little toe and heel</li><li> Stiff polycarbonate inserts under big toe, little toe
  and heel work with the shell to transfer energy to skis</li><li> Notches in the
  plastic along the instep create an active hinge system that makes it easy to get
  your foot in the boot</li><li> Women-specific liners are designed with a lower cuff
  than men's boots to accommodate women's calf muscles; liners are scallop-shaped
  in back to ensure a comfortable fit</li><li> Rossignol Vita Sensor2 70 liners address
  the common fit issues of cramped toes, pressure on the insteps and pressure on forefeet</li><li>
  1-piece toe box and tongue eliminates seams and overlaps in the tongue attachment
  area, reducing pressure points at top of the toes</li><li> Foam padding in the liners
  resists packing out; smooth contours and an anatomic fit eliminates pressure points
  in forefeet</li><li> Specially designed insteps provide excellent midfoot fit, resulting
  in heightened responsiveness, increased circulation and greater warmth</li><li>
  Soft padding securely holds ankles and heels in place; liners are outfitted with
  plush, velvety material</li><li> Wool toe boxes help retain heat in your toes</li><li>
  Custom-formable liners can be heated in a specialty ski shop to achieve a personalized
  fit</li><li> 4 buckles feature a diagonal pull design that sets the foot securely
  into the heel pocket and enhances shell wrap</li><li> Buckles are microadjustable
  for an accurate fit; top 2 buckle catches provide 22mm of adjustability</li><li>
  Power strap serves as a fifth buckle, allowing you to set the firmness around the
  upper ankle as you prefer for comfort or performance</li><li> With a 70 flex index,
  Rossignol Vita Sensor2 70 ski boots provide light resistance against a forward lean,
  appropriate for most progressing skiers</li></ul>
