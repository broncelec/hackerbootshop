<h3>The North Face Aconcagua jacket for boys functions well as a layering piece or as wind- and water-resistant outerwear</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Insulated with 550-fill-power down for a great warmth-to-weight ratio; down is the lightest, warmest and most compressible insulation available</li>
<li> Downproof, quick-drying, wind-resistant nylon shell is treated for water resistance and breathability; polyester taffeta lining slides on easily over layers</li>
<li> Zippered handwarmer pockets quickly warm up chilly fingers</li>
<li> Chin guard has soft fleece lining for added comfort; reinforced windflap behind zipper protects against cold-air penetration and zipper snags</li>
</ul>
