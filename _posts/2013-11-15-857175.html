description_list: <h4>Just because you're a progressing rider, it doesn't mean you
  have to sacrifice style or performance in your gear</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Union Rosa snowboard bindings give you the performance you need to take on the slopes</li><li>
  Flite bases are built specifically for women; they're made with DuPont(TM) Zytel(R)
  ST nylon in a super lightweight, low-profile, freestyle-oriented design</li><li>
  Baseplates are designed to be supremely strong with the smallest footprint possible;
  this promotes free, even board flex for sweet response, board control and durability</li><li>
  Injected EVA bushings damp vibrations underfoot, promoting a comfortable ride and
  smooth, even board flex with no dead spots</li><li> Extruded aluminum heel cups
  undergo an anodizing process that further increases their strength by 30%; they'll
  maintain their shape no matter how much wear and tear they see</li><li> Women-specific
  Rosa highbacks feature a lightweight, forgiving design optimized for comfort, and
  offer tool-free forward lean</li><li> 3D Direct-Connect ankle straps eliminate elasticity
  and evenly distribute pressure across feet and ankles for increased comfort and
  board control</li><li> Multi-position toe straps fit a wide range of boots; magnesium
  buckles are 4 times stronger than aluminum with only half the weight</li><li> Union
  Rosa bindings are compatible with Burton The Channel M6 snowboards</li></ul>
