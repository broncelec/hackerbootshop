<h3>You play hard, ski fast and like to catch air off of jumps</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> You need the Hooligan gloves from The North Face</li>
<li> Water-resistant leather exteriors are lined with soft polyester for great comfort next to skin; leather provides good grip of ski poles and other gear</li>
<li> Heatseeker(TM) polyester fiber insulation at the palms and backs of hands keeps you toasty warm on cold days</li>
<li> FlashDry(TM) fabric additive in liners dramatically improves drying time and breathability without adding weight or bulk or washing out</li>
<li> Made of crushed coconut shells and crushed volcanic rock, FlashDry moves moisture from 1 layer to another to keep you dry</li>
<li> 5 Dimensional Fit(TM) uses 5 measurements of the hand to construct gloves with an accurate and consistent fit</li>
<li> The North Face Hooligan gloves have pads on the knuckles that protect against impacts</li>
</ul>
