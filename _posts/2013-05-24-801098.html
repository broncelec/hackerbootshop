description_list: <h4>The Delta 10 kayak from Delta Kayaks uses a catamaran-style
  hull to achieve remarkable stability and excellent tracking</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Thermoformed ABS plastic hull material is stiff and light like traditional composite
  kayaks and offers similar looks, but costs considerably less</li><li> Specially
  coated exterior offers a new, shiny appearance for years to come- the Delta 10 does
  not suffer from the gradual fade typical of composite watercraft</li><li> Catamaran-style
  hull enhances stability without adding the width typical of standard recreational
  kayaks</li><li> Molded cockpit area with adjustable foot pegs personalizes comfort
  to fit most any size paddler; soft, padded seat keeps things comfortable during
  long days on the water</li><li> Clear window in the cockpit floor lets you view
  the environment below the surface</li><li> Rear compartment offers roomy dry storage
  for day-tripping gear</li><li> Seat forms a watertight bulkhead with the rear compartment
  and offers excellent flotation when hatch is in place</li><li> Front storage pod
  under deck provides dry shelter for small items and adds extra flotation when sealed;
  pod faces you when in the cockpit and seals with a watertight screw</li><li> Cup
  holder near the cockpit offers easy access to beverages</li><li> Bungee rigging
  offers plenty of room for take-along gear</li><li> Small depressions behind cockpit
  are designed to lash down and hold your paddle</li><li> Carry handles at the bow
  and stern are molded into the boat itself and make carrying the boat a breeze</li><li>
  The Delta 10 features 2 tie down points at bow and stern that offer a secure place
  to attach a bow line</li></ul>
