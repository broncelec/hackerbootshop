description_list: <h4>If you're looking for fun and ease while touring, the Kestrel
  140 Comp kayak with rudder from Current Designs offers an experience that's pretty
  close to ideal</h4><ul class="description"><li> 14 ft</li><li> length enhances speed,
  tracking and stability when covering distance on relatively calm waters</li><li>
  Shallow-V hull enhances tracking and offers friendly stability and a lively feel
  in the water</li><li> Swede-form construction enhances speed and maneuverability,
  and it allows bow to punch through waves instead of riding up and over them</li><li>
  Unusually light, strong and stiff, the Kestrel 140 comp kayak with rudder features
  a hybrid construction of fiberglass and a polyaramid (the same material as Kevlar(R))</li><li>
  Vacuum-bagged composite lamination eliminates excess resin, which improves strength
  and reduces weight to a scant 43 lbs</li><li> Roomy cockpit makes it easy for any
  paddler to enter kayak</li><li> Seat creates a natural, comfortable paddling position
  by tilting the entire seat pan up and away from cockpit floor</li><li> Use the lever-lock
  knob (it's similar to a quick-release fork on a bike wheel) to set the seat pan
  to the desired height</li><li> Locking mechanism prevents both side-to-side and
  up-and-down motion</li><li> To prevent numbness, seat pan features a contoured space
  for lower vertebrae and is covered with plush, nonabsorbent, very thick padding</li><li>
  Seat back moves up and down and back and forth, and it articulates to move with
  your paddling motion</li><li> Sliding bar adjusts foot pegs without having to get
  out and reach inside cockpit</li><li> Cockpit-deployable rudder enhances tracking
  in rough weather; toe pedals on top part of foot pegs direct the rudder and steer
  the kayak</li><li> Rear hatch provides enough storage for an overnight trip and
  features an easy-to-use, rubberized hatch cover</li><li> Bow hatch protects contents
  from water thanks to a strap-down hard cover</li><li> Glassed-in bulkheads enhance
  flotation when hatches are sealed</li></ul>
