<h3>The North Face WindWall 1 women's jacket delivers windchill-inhibiting comfort during active cold-weather activities</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> It is slightly less wind resistant than WindWall 2 and a touch lighter weight</li>
<li> WindWall 1 is made from 100-weight fleece and delivers wind-resistant warmth in moderate cold and provides excellent insulation when layered</li>
<li> WindWall 1 fabric blocks about 80% of the wind yet still allows enough airflow to ensure a dry, comfortable fit</li>
<li> The North Face WindWall 1 jacket features a mesh backer fabric and a unique fabric-bonding process that allow limited external air permeability</li>
<li> The North Face WindWall 1 features 2 zippered hand pockets, a drawcord hem and elastic-bound cuffs</li>
<li> Standard fit ensures freedom of motion</li>
</ul>
