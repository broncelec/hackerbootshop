<h3>With a soft, warm interior and sleek, durable exterior, the REI Rauk jacket wicks moisture and breathes easily making it an ideal layer for active fun in crisp, chilly weather</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> 4-way stretch fabric offers a full range of motion and moves moisture away from the body where it evaporates quickly to keep you dry and comfortable</li>
<li> Durable exterior resists pilling while the brushed interior is soft next to skin and holds in warmth</li>
<li> Lightweight overlays at the shoulders and hips prevent abrasion without adding significant weight</li>
<li> Flatlock stitching eliminates chafing and enhances fit by reducing bulky seams</li>
<li> 2 zip hand pockets and zip sleeve pocket with media port</li>
<li> Hood includes a slim drawcord adjustment</li>
<li> Interior windflap; chin guard; drawcord hem; thumb loops</li>
<li> The REI Rauk jacket has a sleek, close-to-body fit</li>
</ul>
