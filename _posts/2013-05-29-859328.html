description_list: <h4>Doug Coombs' legendary spirit lives on in K2 COOMBAck telemark/randonee
  skis</h4><ul class="description"><li> The 102mm-wide waists strike the perfect balance
  for all-conditions backcountry skiiing</li><li> This second graphic in a series
  of three portrays Doug's days pioneering heliskiing in the Chugach Mountains of
  Alaska</li><li> Balanced flex pattern and generous 102mm waists create excellent
  flotation and easy handling on steep slopes and difficult snow conditions</li><li>
  All-terrain rocker features elevated tips that float through powder snow with ease;
  traditional camber underfoot ensures good power and edge hold on firm snow</li><li>
  Fir/aspen/maple wood cores produce a natural flex, allowing the skis to achieve
  full contact with the snow throughout the turn</li><li> Triaxial braiding wraps
  an interlocking fiberglass weave around the wood cores; results in torsional stiffness,
  responsive turning and sensitivity</li><li> Located at the tips and tails, a weave
  of carbon improves responsiveness and edge grip without adding much weight</li><li>
  Cap construction envelops the cores and internal materials with the top layers of
  the skis, keeping overall weight light and durability high</li><li> Powder tips
  place the widest point of the skis farther back than on other K2 skis, making the
  skis more stable and predictable in variable snow conditions</li><li> Top sheets
  feature a hydrophobic material similar to what is used on the bases to prevent snow
  from sticking and building up while you're skinning</li><li> Flat tails let you
  easily plunge your skis into firm snow when building anchors or staking out a tent</li><li>
  Low-profile tip grommets accommodate Z-Clip attachments on K2 climbing skins (sold
  separately); concave notches in the tails keep non-K2-brand skins centered on the
  tails</li><li> Holes drilled in the tips and tails facilitate building a rescue
  sled or constructing a ski anchor</li><li> Base or topsheet color may vary from
  online photo</li></ul>
