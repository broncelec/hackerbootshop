description_list: <h4>Shimano Click'R PD-T700 bike pedals offer an easy-to-use clipless
  option for those wanting to try clipless pedals for the first time</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  They're also great for recreational riding or weekend touring</li><li> At the heart
  of the Click'R design is a light, easy-to-engage cleat spring that makes it quick
  and simple to clip in and clip out of the pedals</li><li> Reduced effort offers
  the efficiencies of a clipless system with little fuss-put a foot down fast for
  unexpected stops or step in casually when you're ready to roll</li><li> Plus, the
  amount of heel twist required to disengage is less than other clipless pedals, so
  you pop out of the pedals easier and sooner</li><li> Pedals feature the convenience
  of dual-side entry; pop-up cages within the pedals grab cleats for fast, easy engagement</li><li>
  Spring tension can be adjusted to your preference</li><li> Integrated reflectors
  are built into the pedal body platforms for enhanced visibility</li><li> Chromoly
  steel spindles and sealed cartridge bearings ensure smooth, long-lasting spinning</li><li>
  SPD cleats are included with the Shimano Click'R PD-T700 bike pedals; please note
  that the SPD cleats will only work with 2-hole SPD-compatible shoes</li></ul>
