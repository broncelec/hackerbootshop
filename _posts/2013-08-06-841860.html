  increases and enhances precision</li><li> After flexing, boots return to upright

  comfort</li><li> Additional padding in the tongues and cuffs absorbs shock and damps
  vibrations, making the ride smooth and easy</li><li> Kids' liners feature soft padding
  and a warm fleecy lining</li><li> Loop on tongues aids in putting the boots on and
  taking them off</li><li> 3-buckle closures offer solid leverage to ensure the best
  possible wrappings of the feet; instep retention promotes safe and comfortable landings</li><li>

  for comfort and performance</li><li> Cuff straps act as a fourth buckle, letting
  the user adjust tightness around the upper ankle</li><li> Flex index of 90 offers
  resistance appropriate for young skiers</li></ul>
