<h3>The Blaze Vest from The North Face is a superlight, synthetic-insulated vest that packs down incredibly small so you can be ready with dependable core warmth whenever and wherever you need it</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> FlashDry(TM) Thermal 60g synthetic insulation is extremely lightweight, warm and packable; plus, it retains warmth when damp and dries quickly</li>
<li> FlashDry microparticles are embedded in the insulation to dramatically improve dry time and breathability</li>
<li> Made of crushed coconut shells and crushed volcanic rock, the FlashDry additive leads to faster dry times and will not wash out</li>
<li> Longlasting center, front, 3-color Vislon(TM) zip closure with interior windflap; drawcord hem; zip hand pockets</li>
<li> The North Face Blaze Vest stows in its own pocket for easy packability</li>
