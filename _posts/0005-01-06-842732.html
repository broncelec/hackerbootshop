<h3>The REI Lightweight Polartec(R) Power Dry(R) Zip-T shirt in men's tall sizes can be worn as the first of several layers in colder temperatures or alone when you need less warmth</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Polartec Power Dry uses 2 different yarns on either side of the fabric to enhance comfort: interior yarn wicks moisture, and exterior yarn dries quickly</li>
<li> The combination of the 2 yarns helps keep you dry during highly aerobic activities because it moves moisture away from skin faster than single-component fabrics such as cotton</li>
<li> Updated fabric protects skin against harmful ultraviolet light with a UPF rating of 20, and is very soft to the touch</li>
<li> Deep center front zipper allows ventilation control; features an inner draft flap and locking zipper head</li>
<li> Flatseam construction is soft and non-chafing next to skin; raglan sleeves keep the seams off the shoulders to minimize irritation when wearing a pack</li>
<li> Underarm and side gussets promote freedom of motion</li>
<li> Dropped back hem stays tucked in</li>
<li> The REI Lightweight Polartec Power Dry Zip-T shirt for tall men features a next-to-skin fit that hugs the body and boosts fabric performance</li>
</ul>
