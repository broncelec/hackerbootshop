<h3>Updated and improved, the REI Double Shot Press Mug lets you enjoy 2 mugs of terrific-tasting coffee when you want, where you want! Updated to include a more durable handle, a new French-press lid with a sliding sip-hole closure and a more secure fit for the included air-tight canister</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Included air-tight canister securely stores away ground coffee in the base of the mug, ensuring that you'll never be without a second round</li>
<li> To brew coffee, simply put your fresh ground coffee in the mug, add hot (not boiling) water, steep, press the plunger and sip-it's that easy! Double-wall stainless-steel construction ensures your coffee stays enjoyably hot and fresh for long periods of time</li>
<li> French-press mechanism comes with its own commuter-style cap with a screen over the sip hole to keep grounds inside; you can close off the sip hole with the sliding mechanism</li>
<li> Or, when using the mug for tea or coffee from a conventional pot, use the secondary commuter cap with sliding sip-hole closure</li>
<li> Mug features a beefy handle to accommodate large hands and a narrow base to fit most cars' cup holders; clip the handle to a pack with an accessory carabiner (sold separately)</li>
<li> 2 rubber gaskets encircle the mug to cut down on vibration noise while in a cup holder and reduce shock to the system if tipped</li>
</ul>
