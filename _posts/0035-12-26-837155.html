<h3>Whether you're hiking, skiing, snowshoeing or Nordic skiing, the men's REI Midweight Polartec(R) Power Dry(R) long underwear bottoms offer excellent comfort</h3>
<ul class="description">
<li> Polartec Power Dry utilizes 2 different yarns on either side of the fabric to enhance comfort: interior yarn wicks moisture, and exterior yarn dries quickly</li>
<li> The combination of the 2 yarns helps keep you dry during highly aerobic activities because it moves moisture away from skin faster than single-component fabrics such as cotton</li>
<li> Flatseam construction is soft and non-chafing next to skin</li>
<li> Brushed elastic waistband ensures a comfortable fit outing after outing</li>
<li> Next-to-skin fit hugs the body, maintaining skin contact to boost fabric performance</li>
<li> Fabric offers UPF rating of 30 to protect against harmful UV light</li>
<li> Functional fly</li>
<li> The men's REI Midweight Polartec Power Dry long underwear bottoms feature a next-to-skin fit that hugs the body</li>
