description_list: <h4>The Carbon Reflex 1 tent is the lightest, double-wall solo tent
  from MSR</h4><ul class="description"><li> It crosses the barrier from ultralight
  to hyperlight, and is ideal for any 3-season adventure you're ready to take on</li><li>
  And one of the best things about the Carbon Reflex 1 is its livability-it packs
  over 7 ft</li><li> of length, has plenty of room to sit up in and includes a roomy
  vestibule</li><li> Comparable to the MSR Hubba tent in volume, the carbon fiber
  poles and efficient design make the Carbon Reflex 1 nearly a pound lighter</li><li>
  Much lighter and stronger than aluminum, cutting-edge carbon fiber poles reduce
  frame weight by up to 30% over aluminum while adding significant strength</li><li>
  Unique geometry provides ample center height and steep sidewalls to maximize usable
  space; non-freestanding design saves precious weight</li><li> Clip construction
  ensures a fast and easy setup</li><li> Taped DuraShield(R)-coated fly and bathtub
  floor are durable and waterproof; all-mesh body offers livability beyond your expectations</li><li>
  4 internal mesh pockets organize small gear</li><li> For a lightweight setup during
  nice weather, leave tent body behind; use the rainfly and footprint (sold separately)
  with the poles and stakes</li></ul>
