  class="description"><li> Bibs allow for comfortable riding with the least constriction
  around your waist</li><li> Bikewear-exclusive fabric is made from New Zealand merino
  wool, a small amount of nylon for extra strength, and Lycra(R) spandex for a snug
  fit that moves with you</li><li> Wool provides excellent temperature regulation,
  especially for stop-and-go sports such as cycling; fabric blend is midweight, soft,
  durable, breathable and machine washable</li><li> Upper back and straps are made
