description_list: <h4>Store up to 4 bikes overhead with the Saris CycleGlide 4-Bike
  Ceiling Mount storage rack, saving precious floor space with its clever sliding
  design</h4><ul class="description"><li> Simple rack system uses 2 tracks that mount
  to ceiling joists and allow the 4 included gliders to hold a bike from its wheels</li><li>
  Gliders, and the bikes hanging from them, can slide side to side to minimize the
  amount of space used when storing; plus, they allow easy access when it comes time
  to ride</li><li> Each glider is designed to hold 1 bicycle that weighs up to 50
  lbs</li><li>; no more than 300 lbs</li><li> should be loaded onto the entire ceiling
  rack system</li><li> Requires an overhead area 6 ft</li><li> wide by 6 ft</li><li>
  deep and at least 11 in</li><li> from nearest wall</li><li> Head clearance will
  be diminished once bikes are hung from the storage rack; ensure you have adequate
  ceiling height or can install rack so that it doesn't impact traffic flow</li><li>
  The Saris CycleGlide storage rack includes two 76 in</li><li> tracks, four 55 in</li><li>
  gliders, 8 hooks and installation hardware; additional tools necessary for proper
  installation</li></ul>
