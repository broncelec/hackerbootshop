description_list: '<h4>A medium flexing boot for intermediate skiers on rockered skis,
  the Dalbello Panterra 90 ski boots enhance comfort with adjustable footbed widths
  and ski/hike switches to make walking easy</h4><ul class="description"><li> Toe
  buckles adjust width of footbeds from a snug 100mm performance-oriented fit to a
  spacious 102mm comfort-oriented fit</li><li> Very lightweight ski/hike mechanisms
  extend the range of motion for the upper cuffs when hiking then lock them down for
  solid, sensitive and powerful control while skiing</li><li> Designed with rockered
  skis in mind, the Panterra 90 ski boots creat an upright, neutral and centered stance
  that improves balance on modern ski shapes</li><li> Boot mold enhances power, precision
  and comfort by matching 4 critical fit points: the heels, ankles, 5th metatarsals
  near your toes and the naviculars near insteps</li><li> 3-piece shell design combines
  separate cuff, shell and tongue sections to create a smooth forward flex with precise
  side-to-side support</li><li> Lightweight, custom-formable liners feature soft,
  warm foam, insulated forefeet and performance insoles</li><li> Liners are engineered
  to fit correctly right out of the box, but they can be custom formed as well, a
  procedure best performed in an REI specialty ski shop</li><li> Medium flex index
  of 90 provides the responsive power transfer suited to progressing intermediate
  skiers</li></ul>'
