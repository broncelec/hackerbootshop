description_list: <h4>From laid-back laps to high-speed attacks, if you demand performance,
  control and fun from your all-mountain board, choose the Burton Feelgood Flying
  V(TM) women's snowboard</h4><ul class="description"><li> Burton designs women's
  boards to correspond with the geometry of the female rider; torsional softness underfoot
  transitions to stabilizing zones between and outside the feet</li><li> Flying V
  is a premium blend of camber and rocker, and offers the best of both worlds in terms
  of performance</li><li> Rocker between and outside your feet enhances playfulness
  and float in powder; subtle camber zones underneath feet combine with edge-gripping
  tech to add pop, snap and power</li><li> Directional shape concentrates pop in the
  tail and offers plenty of overall float and control; twin flex makes riding regular
  or switch simple</li><li> The Channel system offers unlimited, on-the-fly stance
  adjustability and enhances board feel; compatible with EST(TM), Re:Flex(TM) and
  Disc(R) bindings</li><li> The Channel lets you fine-tune your stance width to the
  millimeter, and then dial in your toe-to-heel centering and rotate your angles in
  one fell swoop</li><li> Wood core is snappy, powerful and durable; dual-zone wood
  grains, positioned along the toe and heel edges perpendicular to the core, enhance
  edge hold and add strength</li><li> Fiberglass in the topsheet provides versatile
  flex and response so you can shred everything from big mountain descents to laps
  in the park</li><li> Lightweight Carbon I-Beam(TM) riding up the board's spine adds
  to board's longitudinal snap</li><li> Fiberglass energy strands radiate outward
  from the Channels to the board's edges, providing driving power and effortless response</li><li>
  Edges extend out slightly beneath the bindings for tremendous edge hold in hard,
  icy conditions, but they remain playful and forgiving in softer conditions</li><li>
  Tapered tip and tail thickness reduces swing weight and improves powder flotation</li></ul>
