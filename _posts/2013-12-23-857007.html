description_list: <h4>The boys' Giro Slingshot snow helmet armors his head in top-end
  protection and a light, durable design</h4><ul class="description"><li> It's easy
  to fit and sports soft, cozy lining to keep him comfy while he rocks the slopes</li><li>
  In-mold construction fuses a tough, ventilated polycarbonate shell with an impact-absorbing
  foam liner, resulting in a helmet that is lighter and cooler than many others</li><li>
  Super Cool(TM) vents invite cool, fresh air into the helmet while pushing hot, stale
  air out; optimized vent shapes help regulate temperature to keep him feeling fresh</li><li>
  The Giro Slingshot snow helmet complies with ASTM F 2040 and/or CE EN 1077 alpine
  ski and snowboard helmet standards</li></ul>
