description_list: <h4>Love traditional laces, but don't like lacing them in cold weather?
  DC Ceptor snowboard boots have solved the problem with the new DC Cinch closure
  system</h4><ul class="description"><li> Tighten the lower region to your liking
  and secure the laces with the Cinch; then comfortably lace the uppers without having
  to hold constant pressure to keep the lowers tight</li><li> Moisture-wicking system
  lets moisture vapor escape from the liners through vents in the shells to prevent
  feet from overheating and building up moisture; feet stay drier</li><li> Ergonomically-shaped
  3D tongues with seamless construction prevent pinching and hot spots</li><li> Molded
  backstays in the shells save your legs when you land in the backseat, and won't
  wash out when you hit the gas and go fast</li><li> Articulated upper cuffs offer
  outstanding support and an easy, broken-in feel</li><li> Lightweight, low-profile
  outsoles allow maximum board-to-terrain feel; traction pattern grips well on and
  off the snow and prevents snow from building up and clogging bindings</li><li> Impact-absorbing
  padding won't change properties under varied climates or temperatures, so it always
  remains effective</li><li> Top-of-the-line liners have multidensity cushioning,
  neoprene ankle wraps and anatomic J-bars for the ultimate in comfort and support
  and heel hold</li><li> DC Ceptor boot liners have an antimicrobial treatment to
  hinder foot odor and vents that work with the shells to vent heat and help keep
  liners dry</li></ul>
