description_list: <h4>Black Diamond Camalot(TM) C4 cams utilize a double-axle design
  to retract the cam lobes, giving them a larger expansion range than traditional
  single-axle cams</h4><ul class="description"><li> Large expansion ranges create
  generous overlaps between sizes, allowing you to carry fewer pieces and still cover
  your bases</li><li> C-loop continuous cable stem is strong and durable; rigid stem
  makes for easy placement, yet remains flexible even in cold weather</li><li> Ergonomic
  trigger permits individual manipulation of cams and can be pulled easily with gloved
  hands</li><li> Wide cam lobes distribute the load on soft rock; overall width of
  unit is narrow for better placement in shallow cracks</li><li> Cam lobes and sewn-on
  nylon sling are color-coded for easy identification</li></ul>
