description_list: <h4>The advanced-level Atomic Crimson Ti ARC skis with bindings
  cruise on corduroy and bust through crud thanks to a beefy metal laminate in the
  lightweight wood core and steady 86mm waists</h4><ul class="description"><li> Titanium
  laminate enhances stability and boosts performance at high speeds, and tip-to-tail
  wood core reduces swing weight and enhances overall handling</li><li> 86mm waists
  are fast and smooth on hardpack, and they offer enough stability to have a good
  time off piste and float in powder</li><li> When skis are weighted, there is a slight
  rise in the tips that makes it easy to initiate turns</li><li> When skis are put
  on edge after starting a turn, the camber flattens out to deliver full contact with
  snow and excellent edge hold</li><li> Half-cap construction in tips and tails improves
  durability, and sidewalls in binding area enhance edge grip by absorbing shock</li><li>
  Sidewall construction ensures maximum torsional rigidity, uncanny edge grip and
  controlled tip-to-tail flex; sidewall is reinforced in binding area with 2 layers
  of material</li><li> Integrated bindings allow the skis to flex naturally for excellent
  edge contact and bump absorption</li><li> The Atomic Crimson Ti ARC skis feature
  DIN settings that adjust from 6 to 14, a range suited to advanced skiers at medium
  to high speeds</li><li> Base or topsheet color may vary from online photo</li></ul>
