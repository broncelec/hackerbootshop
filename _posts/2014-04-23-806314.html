description_list: <h4>The powerful Black Diamond Quadrant randonee boots bring the
  skiing performance of a freeride boot together with the light weight of a touring
  boot so you can drive big skis down steep slopes</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Triple-injected, multidensity shells use Pebax plastic for a progressive flex; 120
  flex index is hearty enough to drive big skis down steep lines</li><li> Stiff, lightweight
  custom thermal-formable liners allow for a long-lasting fit and feature a smooth
  antimicrobial lining for easy on and off</li><li> Boa Lacing System provides a precise
  and personalized fit that is simple to adjust with the turn of a dial; Boa holds
  laces tight and secure</li><li> Tech components in front and back give the boot
  Dynafit and G3 Onyx binding compatibility; Quadrant boots are also compatible with
  step-in style randonee bindings</li><li> Ski/walk switches are hassle free with
  a simple on/off toggle; ski mode locks you into a forward lean position that can
  be set from 14deg to 22deg</li><li> Walk mode provides a 40deg range of resistance-free
  motion for comfort while hiking</li><li> 4 micro-adjustable buckles and a power
  strap on each boot close the boots comfortably and securely around the feet and
  legs</li><li> Black Diamond Quadrant boots feature rockered rubber outsoles for
  good grip on snow and rock</li></ul>
