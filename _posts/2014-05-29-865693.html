description_list: '<h4>Forget the typical 1 in</h4><ul class="description"><li> thick
  backcountry pad and trade up for the NEMO Astro(TM) Insulated Sleeping Pad</li><li>
  It has 3 in</li><li> of insulated comfort that practically disappears into your
  pack</li><li> A layer of PrimaLoft(R) provides even and consistent insulation to
  keep you warm even when the ground is cold</li><li> I-beam baffle construction provides
  a flat pad surface and minimizes any bouncy feel when inflated</li><li> 3 in</li><li>
  thick lateral baffles are plush and tend to support body contours better than vertical
  baffles because the pad resists folding around the body''s longitudinal axis</li><li>
  The pillow baffle at the head end is oversized to provide extra loft under your
  head and prevents your camp pillow from sliding off the end of the pad</li><li>
  Durable 75-denier polyester fabric is laminated with a polymer film that keeps the
  fabric airtight and creates strong welds</li><li> Inflation/deflation valve has
  2 positions: pull out to inflate or push in to prevent air from escaping while you
  take your next breath; push all the way in and twist to close</li><li> The NEMO
  Astro(TM) Insulated Sleeping Pad includes a stuff sack, compression strap and repair
  kit</li></ul>'
