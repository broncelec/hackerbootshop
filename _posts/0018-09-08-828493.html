  women's REI Joule goose down sleeping bag keeps the downy warmth dry so you sleep
  like a baby</h4><ul class="description"><li> Tested by an independent third-party

  with the least amount of down</li><li> 60% of insulation is put on top of bag where
  it contributes the most warmth and loft</li><li> In-the-round pattern wraps vertical
  baffles around perimeter of sleeping bag, from head to foot, creating a 3-dimensional
  bag that wraps you in warmth</li><li> Performance fit saves weight by reducing girth
  at shoulders, hips and lower legs while increasing thermal efficiency</li><li> Baffle
  spacing is optimized to keep down in place and prevent cold spots</li><li> Multi-chambered
