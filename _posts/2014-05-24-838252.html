description_list: <h4>An all-in-one package, the Atlas 930 snowshoes starter kit comes
  with snowshoes, poles and a tote bag for great value and convenience</h4><ul class="description"><li>
  Durable frames are crafted from 6061 aluminum to create a stiff yet lightweight
  chassis</li><li> Nose and tail shapes are optimized to provide a balanced platform
  for stable footing and facilitate an easy, natural stride</li><li> Free-Rotating(TM)
  Suspension lets the binding rotate much farther forward than previous Atlas designs,
  freeing up the stride and reducing the amount of tail flip</li><li> The result of
  the design is that freedom of movement is increased, the toe crampon can bite into
  snow better and the foot is allowed a more natural rotation</li><li> Wrapp(TM) Trail
  bindings use a continuous webbing design that tightens snugly with a single pull;
  bindings also cradle feet and arches for a secure, comfortable fit</li><li> Abrasion-resistant,
  lightweight Nytex(TM) nylon decks stay flexible when cold and stand up to the elements
  for lasting use</li><li> Steel toe crampons supply sure-footed traction on icy and
  snowy terrain; heel crampons increase traction while traversing and descending</li><li>
  2-part, adjustable-length poles assist with balance and propulsion; features lightweight
  6000-series aluminum shafts, plastic grips and steel flex-tips</li><li> Poles also
  have wide, alpine powder baskets for pushing/planting stability and adjustable hand
  straps that minimize fatigue and enhance support</li><li> Poles adjust up to 130cm
  in length</li><li> Includes heavyweight nylon tote/storage bag with mesh panels
  that allow snowshoes to dry out after use</li><li> Atlas 930 snowshoes' recommended
  load specification includes weight of hiker with gear</li></ul>
