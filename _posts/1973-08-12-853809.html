<h3>The highly breathable, waterproof and insulated Kannon pants from The North Face let you rip though the deep powder and mountain chutes while outfitted like a pro</h3>

<li> 2</li>
<li>5-layer construction HyVent(R) with laminate offers waterproof, breathable protection over a wider range of temperatures and conditions</li>
<li> 40g synthetic insulation with FlashDry(TM) additive is extremely lightweight, warm and packable; plus, it retains warmth when wet and dries quickly</li>
<li> FlashDry microparticles are embedded in the insulation to dramatically improve dry time and breathability</li>
<li> Made of crushed coconut shells and crushed volcanic rock, the FlashDry additive leads to faster dry times and will not wash out</li>
<li> Fully taped seams create the ultimate seal against wind and snow</li>
<li> Rip-and-stick adjustment tabs at side of waist and zippered, snap-closure fly secure the fit</li>
<li> Inner thigh vents and internal leg gaiters with stretch-mesh gussets work together to control airflow and temperature</li>
<li> 2 hand pockets and a thigh cargo pocket-all with waterproof, bonded zippers-keep accessories organized</li>
<li> Pant-a-locks tabs secure Kannon pants to coordinating jackets from The North Face (not included)</li>
<li> Reinforced edge guards resist abrasion from boots, boards and skis</li>
<li> Embedded RECCO(R) reflector enhances radio signals from search-and-rescue RECCO detectors for quicker acquisition of position in an avalanche</li>
